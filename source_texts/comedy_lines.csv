"In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
"
"And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
[p]anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
[p]whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
"
"You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
[p]sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
[p]good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
[p]worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
[p]than lack it where there is such abundance.
"
"What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
"
"He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
[p]practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
[p]finds no other advantage in the process but only the
[p]losing of hope by time.
"
"This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
[p]'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
[p]almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
[p]far, would have made nature immortal, and death
[p]should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
[p]king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
[p]the death of the king's disease.
"
"How called you the man you speak of, madam?
"
"He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
[p]his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
"
"He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
[p]lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
[p]was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
[p]could be set up against mortality.
"
"What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
"
"A fistula, my lord.
"
"I heard not of it before.
"
"I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
[p]the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
"
"His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
[p]overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
[p]her education promises; her dispositions she
[p]inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
[p]an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
[p]commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
[p]traitors too; in her they are the better for their
[p]simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
"
"Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
"
"'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
[p]in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
[p]her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
[p]livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
[p]go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
[p]a sorrow than have it.
"
"I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
"
"Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
[p]excessive grief the enemy to the living.
"
"If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
[p]makes it soon mortal.
"
"Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
"
"How understand we that?
"
"Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
[p]In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
[p]Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
[p]Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
[p]Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
[p]Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
[p]Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
[p]But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
[p]That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
[p]Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
[p]'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
[p]Advise him.
"
"He cannot want the best
[p]That shall attend his love.
"
"Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
"
"[To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in
[p]your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
[p]to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
"
"Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
[p]your father.
"
"O, were that all! I think not on my father;
[p]And these great tears grace his remembrance more
[p]Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
[p]I have forgot him: my imagination
[p]Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
[p]I am undone: there is no living, none,
[p]If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
[p]That I should love a bright particular star
[p]And think to wed it, he is so above me:
[p]In his bright radiance and collateral light
[p]Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
[p]The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
[p]The hind that would be mated by the lion
[p]Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
[p]To see him every hour; to sit and draw
[p]His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
[p]In our heart's table; heart too capable
[p]Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
[p]But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
[p]Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
[p][Enter PAROLLES]
[p][Aside]
[p]One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
[p]And yet I know him a notorious liar,
[p]Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
[p]Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
[p]That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
[p]Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
[p]Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
"
"Save you, fair queen!
"
"And you, monarch!
"
"No.
"
"And no.
"
"Are you meditating on virginity?
"
"Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
[p]ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
[p]may we barricado it against him?
"
"Keep him out.
"
"But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
[p]in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
[p]warlike resistance.
"
"There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
[p]undermine you and blow you up.
"
"Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
[p]blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
[p]virgins might blow up men?
"
"Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
[p]blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
[p]the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
[p]is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
[p]preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
[p]increase and there was never virgin got till
[p]virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
[p]metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
[p]may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
[p]ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
"
"I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
"
"There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
[p]rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
[p]is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
[p]disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
[p]virginity murders itself and should be buried in
[p]highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
[p]offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
[p]much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
[p]paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
[p]Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
[p]self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
[p]canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
[p]by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
[p]itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
[p]principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
"
"How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
"
"Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
[p]likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
[p]lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
[p]while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
[p]Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
[p]of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
[p]like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
[p]now. Your date is better in your pie and your
[p]porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
[p]your old virginity, is like one of our French
[p]withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
[p]'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
[p]marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
"
"Not my virginity yet [--]
[p]There shall your master have a thousand loves,
[p]A mother and a mistress and a friend,
[p]A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
[p]A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
[p]A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
[p]His humble ambition, proud humility,
[p]His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
[p]His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
[p]Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
[p]That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
[p]I know not what he shall. God send him well!
[p]The court's a learning place, and he is one--
"
"What one, i' faith?
"
"That I wish well. 'Tis pity--
"
"What's pity?
"
"That wishing well had not a body in't,
[p]Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
[p]Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
[p]Might with effects of them follow our friends,
[p]And show what we alone must think, which never
[p]Return us thanks.
"
"Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
"
"Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
[p]will think of thee at court.
"
"Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
"
"Under Mars, I.
"
"I especially think, under Mars.
"
"Why under Mars?
"
"The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
[p]be born under Mars.
"
"When he was predominant.
"
"When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
"
"Why think you so?
"
"You go so much backward when you fight.
"
"That's for advantage.
"
"So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
[p]but the composition that your valour and fear makes
[p]in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
"
"I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
[p]acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
[p]which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
[p]thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
[p]counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
[p]thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
[p]thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
[p]thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
[p]none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
[p]and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.
"
"Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
[p]Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
[p]Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
[p]Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
[p]What power is it which mounts my love so high,
[p]That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
[p]The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
[p]To join like likes and kiss like native things.
[p]Impossible be strange attempts to those
[p]That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
[p]What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
[p]So show her merit, that did miss her love?
[p]The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
[p]But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.
"
"The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
[p]Have fought with equal fortune and continue
[p]A braving war.
"
"So 'tis reported, sir.
"
"Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
[p]A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
[p]With caution that the Florentine will move us
[p]For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
[p]Prejudicates the business and would seem
[p]To have us make denial.
"
"His love and wisdom,
[p]Approved so to your majesty, may plead
[p]For amplest credence.
"
"He hath arm'd our answer,
[p]And Florence is denied before he comes:
[p]Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
[p]The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
[p]To stand on either part.
"
"It well may serve
[p]A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
[p]For breathing and exploit.
"
"What's he comes here?
"
"It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
[p]Young Bertram.
"
"Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
[p]Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
[p]Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
[p]Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
"
"My thanks and duty are your majesty's.
"
"I would I had that corporal soundness now,
[p]As when thy father and myself in friendship
[p]First tried our soldiership! He did look far
[p]Into the service of the time and was
[p]Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
[p]But on us both did haggish age steal on
[p]And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
[p]To talk of your good father. In his youth
[p]He had the wit which I can well observe
[p]To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
[p]Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
[p]Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
[p]So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
[p]Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
[p]His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
[p]Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
[p]Exception bid him speak, and at this time
[p]His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
[p]He used as creatures of another place
[p]And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
[p]Making them proud of his humility,
[p]In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
[p]Might be a copy to these younger times;
[p]Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
[p]But goers backward.
"
"His good remembrance, sir,
[p]Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
[p]So in approof lives not his epitaph
[p]As in your royal speech.
"
"Would I were with him! He would always say--
[p]Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
[p]He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
[p]To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
[p]This his good melancholy oft began,
[p]On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
[p]When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
[p]'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
[p]Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
[p]All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
[p]Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
[p]Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
[p]I after him do after him wish too,
[p]Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
[p]I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
[p]To give some labourers room.
"
"You are loved, sir:
[p]They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
"
"I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
[p]Since the physician at your father's died?
[p]He was much famed.
"
"Some six months since, my lord.
"
"If he were living, I would try him yet.
[p]Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
[p]With several applications; nature and sickness
[p]Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
[p]My son's no dearer.
"
"Thank your majesty.
"
"I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
"
"Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I
[p]wish might be found in the calendar of my past
[p]endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make
[p]foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
[p]ourselves we publish them.
"
"What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
[p]the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
[p]believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
[p]you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
[p]enough to make such knaveries yours.
"
"'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
"
"Well, sir.
"
"No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though
[p]many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have
[p]your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel
[p]the woman and I will do as we may.
"
"Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
"
"I do beg your good will in this case.
"
"In what case?
"
"In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
[p]heritage: and I think I shall never have the
[p]blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
[p]they say barnes are blessings.
"
"Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
"
"My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
[p]by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
"
"Is this all your worship's reason?
"
"Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
[p]are.
"
"May the world know them?
"
"I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
[p]all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
[p]that I may repent.
"
"Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
"
"I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have
[p]friends for my wife's sake.
"
"Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
"
"You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the
[p]knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
[p]He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
[p]leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my
[p]drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
[p]of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
[p]and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
[p]flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
[p]my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
[p]be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
[p]for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
[p]Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in
[p]religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl
[p]horns together, like any deer i' the herd.
"
"Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?
"
"A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next
[p]way:
[p]For I the ballad will repeat,
[p]Which men full true shall find;
[p]Your marriage comes by destiny,
[p]Your cuckoo sings by kind.
"
"Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
"
"May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to
[p]you: of her I am to speak.
"
"Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;
[p]Helen, I mean.
"
"Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
[p]Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
[p]Fond done, done fond,
[p]Was this King Priam's joy?
[p]With that she sighed as she stood,
[p]With that she sighed as she stood,
[p]And gave this sentence then;
[p]Among nine bad if one be good,
[p]Among nine bad if one be good,
[p]There's yet one good in ten.
"
"What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.
"
"One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying
[p]o' the song: would God would serve the world so all
[p]the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
[p]if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we
[p]might have a good woman born but one every blazing
[p]star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery
[p]well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck
[p]one.
"
"You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
"
"That man should be at woman's command, and yet no
[p]hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it
[p]will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of
[p]humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
[p]going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.
"
"Well, now.
"
"I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
"
"Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and
[p]she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully
[p]make title to as much love as she finds: there is
[p]more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid
[p]her than she'll demand.
"
"Madam, I was very late more near her than I think
[p]she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate
[p]to herself her own words to her own ears; she
[p]thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
[p]stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:
[p]Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put
[p]such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no
[p]god, that would not extend his might, only where
[p]qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that
[p]would suffer her poor knight surprised, without
[p]rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
[p]This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
[p]sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I
[p]held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;
[p]sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns
[p]you something to know it.
"
"You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
[p]yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this
[p]before, which hung so tottering in the balance that
[p]I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
[p]leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you
[p]for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.
[p][Exit Steward]
[p][Enter HELENA]
[p]Even so it was with me when I was young:
[p]If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
[p]Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
[p]Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
[p]It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
[p]Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:
[p]By our remembrances of days foregone,
[p]Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
[p]Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.
"
"What is your pleasure, madam?
"
"You know, Helen,
[p]I am a mother to you.
"
"Mine honourable mistress.
"
"Nay, a mother:
[p]Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
[p]Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'
[p]That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
[p]And put you in the catalogue of those
[p]That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
[p]Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
[p]A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
[p]You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
[p]Yet I express to you a mother's care:
[p]God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
[p]To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
[p]That this distemper'd messenger of wet,
[p]The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
[p]Why? that you are my daughter?
"
"That I am not.
"
"I say, I am your mother.
"
"Pardon, madam;
[p]The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
[p]I am from humble, he from honour'd name;
[p]No note upon my parents, his all noble:
[p]My master, my dear lord he is; and I
[p]His servant live, and will his vassal die:
[p]He must not be my brother.
"
"Nor I your mother?
"
"You are my mother, madam; would you were,--
[p]So that my lord your son were not my brother,--
[p]Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
[p]I care no more for than I do for heaven,
[p]So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
[p]But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
"
"Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
[p]God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
[p]So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
[p]My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
[p]The mystery of your loneliness, and find
[p]Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
[p]You love my son; invention is ashamed,
[p]Against the proclamation of thy passion,
[p]To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
[p]But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
[p]Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
[p]See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
[p]That in their kind they speak it: only sin
[p]And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
[p]That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
[p]If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
[p]If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
[p]As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
[p]Tell me truly.
"
"Good madam, pardon me!
"
"Do you love my son?
"
"Your pardon, noble mistress!
"
"Love you my son?
"
"Do not you love him, madam?
"
"Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
[p]Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
[p]The state of your affection; for your passions
[p]Have to the full appeach'd.
"
"Then, I confess,
[p]Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
[p]That before you, and next unto high heaven,
[p]I love your son.
[p]My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
[p]Be not offended; for it hurts not him
[p]That he is loved of me: I follow him not
[p]By any token of presumptuous suit;
[p]Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
[p]Yet never know how that desert should be.
[p]I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
[p]Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
[p]I still pour in the waters of my love
[p]And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,
[p]Religious in mine error, I adore
[p]The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
[p]But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
[p]Let not your hate encounter with my love
[p]For loving where you do: but if yourself,
[p]Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
[p]Did ever in so true a flame of liking
[p]Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
[p]Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
[p]To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
[p]But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
[p]That seeks not to find that her search implies,
[p]But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!
"
"Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--
[p]To go to Paris?
"
"Madam, I had.
"
"Wherefore? tell true.
"
"I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
[p]You know my father left me some prescriptions
[p]Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
[p]And manifest experience had collected
[p]For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
[p]In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
[p]As notes whose faculties inclusive were
[p]More than they were in note: amongst the rest,
[p]There is a remedy, approved, set down,
[p]To cure the desperate languishings whereof
[p]The king is render'd lost.
"
"This was your motive
[p]For Paris, was it? speak.
"
"My lord your son made me to think of this;
[p]Else Paris and the medicine and the king
[p]Had from the conversation of my thoughts
[p]Haply been absent then.
"
"But think you, Helen,
[p]If you should tender your supposed aid,
[p]He would receive it? he and his physicians
[p]Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
[p]They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
[p]A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
[p]Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
[p]The danger to itself?
"
"There's something in't,
[p]More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
[p]Of his profession, that his good receipt
[p]Shall for my legacy be sanctified
[p]By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
[p]But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
[p]The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
[p]By such a day and hour.
"
"Dost thou believe't?
"
"Ay, madam, knowingly.
"
"Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
[p]Means and attendants and my loving greetings
[p]To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
[p]And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
[p]Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
[p]What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.
"
"Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
[p]Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
[p]Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
[p]The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
[p]And is enough for both.
"
"'Tis our hope, sir,
[p]After well enter'd soldiers, to return
[p]And find your grace in health.
"
"No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
[p]Will not confess he owes the malady
[p]That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
[p]Whether I live or die, be you the sons
[p]Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--
[p]Those bated that inherit but the fall
[p]Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
[p]Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
[p]The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
[p]That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.
"
"Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!
"
"Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
[p]They say, our French lack language to deny,
[p]If they demand: beware of being captives,
[p]Before you serve.
"
"Our hearts receive your warnings.
"
"Farewell. Come hither to me.
"
"O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
"
"'Tis not his fault, the spark.
"
"O, 'tis brave wars!
"
"Most admirable: I have seen those wars.
"
"I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
[p]'Too young' and 'the next year' and 'tis too early.'
"
"An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.
"
"I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
[p]Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
[p]Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
[p]But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.
"
"There's honour in the theft.
"
"Commit it, count.
"
"I am your accessary; and so, farewell.
"
"I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.
"
"Farewell, captain.
"
"Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
"
"Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good
[p]sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall
[p]find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain
[p]Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here
[p]on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
[p]entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his
[p]reports for me.
"
"We shall, noble captain.
"
"Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?
"
"Stay: the king.
"
"[To BERTRAM] Use a more spacious ceremony to the
[p]noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the
[p]list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to
[p]them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the
[p]time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and
[p]move under the influence of the most received star;
[p]and though the devil lead the measure, such are to
[p]be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.
"
"And I will do so.
"
"Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
"
"[Kneeling] Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
"
"I'll fee thee to stand up.
"
"Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
[p]I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,
[p]And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
"
"I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
[p]And ask'd thee mercy for't.
"
"Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
[p]Will you be cured of your infirmity?
"
"No.
"
"O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
[p]Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
[p]My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
[p]That's able to breathe life into a stone,
[p]Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
[p]With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
[p]Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
[p]To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
[p]And write to her a love-line.
"
"What 'her' is this?
"
"Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
[p]If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
[p]If seriously I may convey my thoughts
[p]In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
[p]With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
[p]Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
[p]Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
[p]For that is her demand, and know her business?
[p]That done, laugh well at me.
"
"Now, good Lafeu,
[p]Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
[p]May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
[p]By wondering how thou took'st it.
"
"Nay, I'll fit you,
[p]And not be all day neither.
"
"Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
"
"Nay, come your ways.
"
"This haste hath wings indeed.
"
"Nay, come your ways:
[p]This is his majesty; say your mind to him:
[p]A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
[p]His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,
[p]That dare leave two together; fare you well.
"
"Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
[p]Gerard de Narbon was my father;
[p]In what he did profess, well found.
"
"I knew him.
"
"The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
[p]Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
[p]Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
[p]Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
[p]And of his old experience the oily darling,
[p]He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
[p]Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
[p]And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
[p]With that malignant cause wherein the honour
[p]Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
[p]I come to tender it and my appliance
[p]With all bound humbleness.
"
"We thank you, maiden;
[p]But may not be so credulous of cure,
[p]When our most learned doctors leave us and
[p]The congregated college have concluded
[p]That labouring art can never ransom nature
[p]From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
[p]So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
[p]To prostitute our past-cure malady
[p]To empirics, or to dissever so
[p]Our great self and our credit, to esteem
[p]A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
"
"My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
[p]I will no more enforce mine office on you.
[p]Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
[p]A modest one, to bear me back a again.
"
"I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:
[p]Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
[p]As one near death to those that wish him live:
[p]But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
[p]I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
"
"What I can do can do no hurt to try,
[p]Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
[p]He that of greatest works is finisher
[p]Oft does them by the weakest minister:
[p]So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
[p]When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
[p]From simple sources, and great seas have dried
[p]When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
[p]Oft expectation fails and most oft there
[p]Where most it promises, and oft it hits
[p]Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.
"
"I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
[p]Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
[p]Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
"
"Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:
[p]It is not so with Him that all things knows
[p]As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
[p]But most it is presumption in us when
[p]The help of heaven we count the act of men.
[p]Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
[p]Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
[p]I am not an impostor that proclaim
[p]Myself against the level of mine aim;
[p]But know I think and think I know most sure
[p]My art is not past power nor you past cure.
"
"Are thou so confident? within what space
[p]Hopest thou my cure?
"
"The great'st grace lending grace
[p]Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
[p]Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
[p]Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
[p]Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
[p]Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
[p]Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
[p]What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
[p]Health shall live free and sickness freely die.
"
"Upon thy certainty and confidence
[p]What darest thou venture?
"
"Tax of impudence,
[p]A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
[p]Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
[p]Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended
[p]With vilest torture let my life be ended.
"
"Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
[p]His powerful sound within an organ weak:
[p]And what impossibility would slay
[p]In common sense, sense saves another way.
[p]Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
[p]Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
[p]Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
[p]That happiness and prime can happy call:
[p]Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
[p]Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
[p]Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
[p]That ministers thine own death if I die.
"
"If I break time, or flinch in property
[p]Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
[p]And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;
[p]But, if I help, what do you promise me?
"
"Make thy demand.
"
"But will you make it even?
"
"Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
"
"Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
[p]What husband in thy power I will command:
[p]Exempted be from me the arrogance
[p]To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
[p]My low and humble name to propagate
[p]With any branch or image of thy state;
[p]But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
[p]Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
"
"Here is my hand; the premises observed,
[p]Thy will by my performance shall be served:
[p]So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
[p]Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
[p]More should I question thee, and more I must,
[p]Though more to know could not be more to trust,
[p]From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
[p]Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
[p]Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
[p]As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.
"
"Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of
[p]your breeding.
"
"I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
[p]know my business is but to the court.
"
"To the court! why, what place make you special,
[p]when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
"
"Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
[p]may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
[p]a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
[p]has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed
[p]such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
[p]court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
[p]men.
"
"Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
[p]questions.
"
"It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,
[p]the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
[p]buttock, or any buttock.
"
"Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
"
"As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
[p]as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's
[p]rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
[p]Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
[p]hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
[p]to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
[p]friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.
"
"Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
[p]questions?
"
"From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
[p]will fit any question.
"
"It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
[p]must fit all demands.
"
"But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
[p]should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
[p]belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
[p]do you no harm to learn.
"
"To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
[p]question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
[p]pray you, sir, are you a courtier?
"
"O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,
[p]more, a hundred of them.
"
"Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
"
"O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.
"
"I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
"
"O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
"
"You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.
"
"O Lord, sir! spare not me.
"
"Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and
[p]'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very
[p]sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
[p]to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.
"
"I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,
[p]sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.
"
"I play the noble housewife with the time
[p]To entertain't so merrily with a fool.
"
"O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.
"
"An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
[p]And urge her to a present answer back:
[p]Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
[p]This is not much.
"
"Not much commendation to them.
"
"Not much employment for you: you understand me?
"
"Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.
"
"Haste you again.
"
"They say miracles are past; and we have our
[p]philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,
[p]things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that
[p]we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
[p]into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
[p]ourselves to an unknown fear.
"
"Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
[p]shot out in our latter times.
"
"And so 'tis.
"
"To be relinquish'd of the artists,--
"
"So I say.
"
"Both of Galen and Paracelsus.
"
"So I say.
"
"Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--
"
"Right; so I say.
"
"That gave him out incurable,--
"
"Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
"
"Not to be helped,--
"
"Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a--
"
"Uncertain life, and sure death.
"
"Just, you say well; so would I have said.
"
"I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.
"
"It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you
[p]shall read it in--what do you call there?
"
"A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.
"
"That's it; I would have said the very same.
"
"Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,
[p]I speak in respect--
"
"Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the
[p]brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most
[p]facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--
"
"Very hand of heaven.
"
"Ay, so I say.
"
"In a most weak--
[p][pausing]
[p]and debile minister, great power, great
[p]transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a
[p]further use to be made than alone the recovery of
[p]the king, as to be--
[p][pausing]
[p]generally thankful.
"
"I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.
[p][Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and]
[p]PAROLLES retire]
"
"Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the
[p]better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's
[p]able to lead her a coranto.
"
"Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?
"
"'Fore God, I think so.
"
"Go, call before me all the lords in court.
[p]Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
[p]And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
[p]Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
[p]The confirmation of my promised gift,
[p]Which but attends thy naming.
[p][Enter three or four Lords]
[p]Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
[p]Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
[p]O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
[p]I have to use: thy frank election make;
[p]Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
"
"To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
[p]Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!
"
"I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
[p]My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
[p]And writ as little beard.
"
"Peruse them well:
[p]Not one of those but had a noble father.
"
"Gentlemen,
[p]Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.
"
"We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
"
"I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
[p]That I protest I simply am a maid.
[p]Please it your majesty, I have done already:
[p]The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
[p]'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
[p]Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
[p]We'll ne'er come there again.'
"
"Make choice; and, see,
[p]Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
"
"Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
[p]And to imperial Love, that god most high,
[p]Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
"
"And grant it.
"
"Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
"
"I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
[p]for my life.
"
"The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
[p]Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
[p]Love make your fortunes twenty times above
[p]Her that so wishes and her humble love!
"
"No better, if you please.
"
"My wish receive,
[p]Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.
"
"Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
[p]I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the
[p]Turk, to make eunuchs of.
"
"Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
[p]I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
[p]Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
[p]Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
"
"These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:
[p]sure, they are bastards to the English; the French
[p]ne'er got 'em.
"
"You are too young, too happy, and too good,
[p]To make yourself a son out of my blood.
"
"Fair one, I think not so.
"
"There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk
[p]wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth
[p]of fourteen; I have known thee already.
"
"[To BERTRAM] I dare not say I take you; but I give
[p]Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
[p]Into your guiding power. This is the man.
"
"Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
"
"My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
[p]In such a business give me leave to use
[p]The help of mine own eyes.
"
"Know'st thou not, Bertram,
[p]What she has done for me?
"
"Yes, my good lord;
[p]But never hope to know why I should marry her.
"
"Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.
"
"But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
[p]Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
[p]She had her breeding at my father's charge.
[p]A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
[p]Rather corrupt me ever!
"
"'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
[p]I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
[p]Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
[p]Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
[p]In differences so mighty. If she be
[p]All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
[p]A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
[p]Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
[p]From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
[p]The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
[p]Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
[p]It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
[p]Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
[p]The property by what it is should go,
[p]Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
[p]In these to nature she's immediate heir,
[p]And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
[p]Which challenges itself as honour's born
[p]And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
[p]When rather from our acts we them derive
[p]Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
[p]Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
[p]A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
[p]Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
[p]Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
[p]If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
[p]I can create the rest: virtue and she
[p]Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
"
"I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.
"
"Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
"
"That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:
[p]Let the rest go.
"
"My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
[p]I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
[p]Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
[p]That dost in vile misprision shackle up
[p]My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
[p]We, poising us in her defective scale,
[p]Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
[p]It is in us to plant thine honour where
[p]We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
[p]Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
[p]Believe not thy disdain, but presently
[p]Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
[p]Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
[p]Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
[p]Into the staggers and the careless lapse
[p]Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
[p]Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
[p]Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
"
"Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
[p]My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
[p]What great creation and what dole of honour
[p]Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
[p]Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
[p]The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
[p]Is as 'twere born so.
"
"Take her by the hand,
[p]And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
[p]A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
[p]A balance more replete.
"
"I take her hand.
"
"Good fortune and the favour of the king
[p]Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
[p]Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
[p]And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
[p]Shall more attend upon the coming space,
[p]Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
[p]Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
"
"[Advancing] Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.
"
"Your pleasure, sir?
"
"Your lord and master did well to make his
[p]recantation.
"
"Recantation! My lord! my master!
"
"Ay; is it not a language I speak?
"
"A most harsh one, and not to be understood without
[p]bloody succeeding. My master!
"
"Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
"
"To any count, to all counts, to what is man.
"
"To what is count's man: count's master is of
[p]another style.
"
"You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.
"
"I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which
[p]title age cannot bring thee.
"
"What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
"
"I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty
[p]wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
[p]travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
[p]bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
[p]believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I
[p]have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care
[p]not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and
[p]that thou't scarce worth.
"
"Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--
"
"Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou
[p]hasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee
[p]for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee
[p]well: thy casement I need not open, for I look
[p]through thee. Give me thy hand.
"
"My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
"
"Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
"
"I have not, my lord, deserved it.
"
"Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not
[p]bate thee a scruple.
"
"Well, I shall be wiser.
"
"Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at
[p]a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound
[p]in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is
[p]to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold
[p]my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
[p]that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.
"
"My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
"
"I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor
[p]doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by
[p]thee, in what motion age will give me leave.
"
"Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off
[p]me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must
[p]be patient; there is no fettering of authority.
[p]I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with
[p]any convenience, an he were double and double a
[p]lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I
[p]would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.
"
"Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news
[p]for you: you have a new mistress.
"
"I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
[p]some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good
[p]lord: whom I serve above is my master.
"
"Who? God?
"
"Ay, sir.
"
"The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
[p]garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of
[p]sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
[p]thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
[p]honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat
[p]thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
[p]every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
[p]created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
"
"This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
"
"Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
[p]kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
[p]no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
[p]and honourable personages than the commission of your
[p]birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not
[p]worth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.
"
"Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good;
[p]let it be concealed awhile.
"
"Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
"
"What's the matter, sweet-heart?
"
"Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
[p]I will not bed her.
"
"What, what, sweet-heart?
"
"O my Parolles, they have married me!
[p]I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
"
"France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
[p]The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!
"
"There's letters from my mother: what the import is,
[p]I know not yet.
"
"Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
[p]He wears his honour in a box unseen,
[p]That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
[p]Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
[p]Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
[p]Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
[p]France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
[p]Therefore, to the war!
"
"It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
[p]Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
[p]And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
[p]That which I durst not speak; his present gift
[p]Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
[p]Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
[p]To the dark house and the detested wife.
"
"Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?
"
"Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
[p]I'll send her straight away: to-morrow
[p]I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
"
"Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
[p]A young man married is a man that's marr'd:
[p]Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:
[p]The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.
"
"My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
"
"She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's
[p]very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be
[p]given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the
[p]world; but yet she is not well.
"
"If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's
[p]not very well?
"
"Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
"
"What two things?
"
"One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her
[p]quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence
[p]God send her quickly!
"
"Bless you, my fortunate lady!
"
"I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own
[p]good fortunes.
"
"You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them
[p]on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
"
"So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
[p]I would she did as you say.
"
"Why, I say nothing.
"
"Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's
[p]tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say
[p]nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
[p]nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which
[p]is within a very little of nothing.
"
"Away! thou'rt a knave.
"
"You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a
[p]knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
[p]been truth, sir.
"
"Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
"
"Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
[p]taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;
[p]and much fool may you find in you, even to the
[p]world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.
"
"A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
[p]Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
[p]A very serious business calls on him.
[p]The great prerogative and rite of love,
[p]Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
[p]But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
[p]Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
[p]Which they distil now in the curbed time,
[p]To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
[p]And pleasure drown the brim.
"
"What's his will else?
"
"That you will take your instant leave o' the king
[p]And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
[p]Strengthen'd with what apology you think
[p]May make it probable need.
"
"What more commands he?
"
"That, having this obtain'd, you presently
[p]Attend his further pleasure.
"
"In every thing I wait upon his will.
"
"I shall report it so.
"
"I pray you.
[p][Exit PAROLLES]
[p]Come, sirrah.
"
"But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
"
"Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
"
"You have it from his own deliverance.
"
"And by other warranted testimony.
"
"Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.
"
"I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in
[p]knowledge and accordingly valiant.
"
"I have then sinned against his experience and
[p]transgressed against his valour; and my state that
[p]way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my
[p]heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make
[p]us friends; I will pursue the amity.
"
"[To BERTRAM] These things shall be done, sir.
"
"Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
"
"Sir?
"
"O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good
[p]workman, a very good tailor.
"
"[Aside to PAROLLES] Is she gone to the king?
"
"She is.
"
"Will she away to-night?
"
"As you'll have her.
"
"I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
[p]Given order for our horses; and to-night,
[p]When I should take possession of the bride,
[p]End ere I do begin.
"
"A good traveller is something at the latter end of a
[p]dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a
[p]known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should
[p]be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.
"
"Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
"
"I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
[p]displeasure.
"
"You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs
[p]and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and
[p]out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer
[p]question for your residence.
"
"It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
"
"And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's
[p]prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this
[p]of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the
[p]soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
[p]matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
[p]tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:
[p]I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
[p]deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.
"
"An idle lord. I swear.
"
"I think so.
"
"Why, do you not know him?
"
"Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
[p]Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.
"
"I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
[p]Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
[p]For present parting; only he desires
[p]Some private speech with you.
"
"I shall obey his will.
[p]You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
[p]Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
[p]The ministration and required office
[p]On my particular. Prepared I was not
[p]For such a business; therefore am I found
[p]So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
[p]That presently you take our way for home;
[p]And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
[p]For my respects are better than they seem
[p]And my appointments have in them a need
[p]Greater than shows itself at the first view
[p]To you that know them not. This to my mother:
[p][Giving a letter]
[p]'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
[p]I leave you to your wisdom.
"
"Sir, I can nothing say,
[p]But that I am your most obedient servant.
"
"Come, come, no more of that.
"
"And ever shall
[p]With true observance seek to eke out that
[p]Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
[p]To equal my great fortune.
"
"Let that go:
[p]My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.
"
"Pray, sir, your pardon.
"
"Well, what would you say?
"
"I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
[p]Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
[p]But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
[p]What law does vouch mine own.
"
"What would you have?
"
"Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
[p]I would not tell you what I would, my lord:
[p]Faith yes;
[p]Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.
"
"I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
"
"I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
"
"Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.
[p][Exit HELENA]
[p]Go thou toward home; where I will never come
[p]Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
[p]Away, and for our flight.
"
"Bravely, coragio!
"
"So that from point to point now have you heard
[p]The fundamental reasons of this war,
[p]Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
[p]And more thirsts after.
"
"Holy seems the quarrel
[p]Upon your grace's part; black and fearful
[p]On the opposer.
"
"Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
[p]Would in so just a business shut his bosom
[p]Against our borrowing prayers.
"
"Good my lord,
[p]The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
[p]But like a common and an outward man,
[p]That the great figure of a council frames
[p]By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
[p]Say what I think of it, since I have found
[p]Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
[p]As often as I guess'd.
"
"Be it his pleasure.
"
"But I am sure the younger of our nature,
[p]That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
[p]Come here for physic.
"
"Welcome shall they be;
[p]And all the honours that can fly from us
[p]Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
[p]When better fall, for your avails they fell:
[p]To-morrow to the field.
"
"It hath happened all as I would have had it, save
[p]that he comes not along with her.
"
"By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
[p]melancholy man.
"
"By what observance, I pray you?
"
"Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the
[p]ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
[p]teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
[p]melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
"
"Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
"
"I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
[p]old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing
[p]like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:
[p]the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
[p]love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
"
"What have we here?
"
"E'en that you have there.
"
"[Reads] I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath
[p]recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded
[p]her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'
[p]eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it
[p]before the report come. If there be breadth enough
[p]in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty
[p]to you.. Your unfortunate son,
[p]BERTRAM.
[p]This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
[p]To fly the favours of so good a king;
[p]To pluck his indignation on thy head
[p]By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
[p]For the contempt of empire.
"
"O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two
[p]soldiers and my young lady!
"
"What is the matter?
"
"Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
[p]comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I
[p]thought he would.
"
"Why should he be killed?
"
"So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:
[p]the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of
[p]men, though it be the getting of children. Here
[p]they come will tell you more: for my part, I only
[p]hear your son was run away.
"
"Save you, good madam.
"
"Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
"
"Do not say so.
"
"Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
[p]I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
[p]That the first face of neither, on the start,
[p]Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?
"
"Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
[p]We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
[p]And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
[p]Thither we bend again.
"
"Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.
[p][Reads]
[p]When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
[p]never shall come off, and show me a child begotten
[p]of thy body that I am father to, then call me
[p]husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
[p]This is a dreadful sentence.
"
"Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
"
"Ay, madam;
[p]And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.
"
"I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
[p]If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
[p]Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;
[p]But I do wash his name out of my blood,
[p]And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
"
"Ay, madam.
"
"And to be a soldier?
"
"Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,
[p]The duke will lay upon him all the honour
[p]That good convenience claims.
"
"Return you thither?
"
"Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
"
"[Reads] Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
[p]'Tis bitter.
"
"Find you that there?
"
"Ay, madam.
"
"'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his
[p]heart was not consenting to.
"
"Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
[p]There's nothing here that is too good for him
[p]But only she; and she deserves a lord
[p]That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
[p]And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
"
"A servant only, and a gentleman
[p]Which I have sometime known.
"
"Parolles, was it not?
"
"Ay, my good lady, he.
"
"A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
[p]My son corrupts a well-derived nature
[p]With his inducement.
"
"Indeed, good lady,
[p]The fellow has a deal of that too much,
[p]Which holds him much to have.
"
"You're welcome, gentlemen.
[p]I will entreat you, when you see my son,
[p]To tell him that his sword can never win
[p]The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
[p]Written to bear along.
"
"We serve you, madam,
[p]In that and all your worthiest affairs.
"
"Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
[p]Will you draw near!
"
"'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
[p]Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
[p]Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
[p]Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
[p]That chase thee from thy country and expose
[p]Those tender limbs of thine to the event
[p]Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
[p]That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
[p]Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
[p]Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
[p]That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
[p]Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
[p]That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
[p]Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
[p]Whoever charges on his forward breast,
[p]I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
[p]And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
[p]His death was so effected: better 'twere
[p]I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
[p]With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
[p]That all the miseries which nature owes
[p]Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
[p]Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
[p]As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
[p]My being here it is that holds thee hence:
[p]Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although
[p]The air of paradise did fan the house
[p]And angels officed all: I will be gone,
[p]That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
[p]To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
[p]For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.
"
"The general of our horse thou art; and we,
[p]Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
[p]Upon thy promising fortune.
"
"Sir, it is
[p]A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
[p]We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
[p]To the extreme edge of hazard.
"
"Then go thou forth;
[p]And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
[p]As thy auspicious mistress!
"
"This very day,
[p]Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
[p]Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
[p]A lover of thy drum, hater of love.
"
"Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
[p]Might you not know she would do as she has done,
[p]By sending me a letter? Read it again.
"
"[Reads]
[p]I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:
[p]Ambitious love hath so in me offended,
[p]That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
[p]With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
[p]Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
[p]My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:
[p]Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
[p]His name with zealous fervor sanctify:
[p]His taken labours bid him me forgive;
[p]I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
[p]From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
[p]Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:
[p]He is too good and fair for death and me:
[p]Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.
"
"Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
[p]Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
[p]As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,
[p]I could have well diverted her intents,
[p]Which thus she hath prevented.
"
"Pardon me, madam:
[p]If I had given you this at over-night,
[p]She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,
[p]Pursuit would be but vain.
"
"What angel shall
[p]Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
[p]Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
[p]And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
[p]Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
[p]To this unworthy husband of his wife;
[p]Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
[p]That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
[p]Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
[p]Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
[p]When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
[p]He will return; and hope I may that she,
[p]Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
[p]Led hither by pure love: which of them both
[p]Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
[p]To make distinction: provide this messenger:
[p]My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
[p]Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.
"
"Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we
[p]shall lose all the sight.
"
"They say the French count has done most honourable service.
"
"It is reported that he has taken their greatest
[p]commander; and that with his own hand he slew the
[p]duke's brother.
[p][Tucket]
[p]We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary
[p]way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.
"
"Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with
[p]the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this
[p]French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and
[p]no legacy is so rich as honesty.
"
"I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
[p]by a gentleman his companion.
"
"I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a
[p]filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
[p]young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,
[p]enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of
[p]lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid
[p]hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,
[p]example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of
[p]maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,
[p]but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
[p]them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but
[p]I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,
[p]though there were no further danger known but the
[p]modesty which is so lost.
"
"You shall not need to fear me.
"
"I hope so.
[p][Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim]
[p]Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at
[p]my house; thither they send one another: I'll
[p]question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?
"
"To Saint Jaques le Grand.
[p]Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
"
"At the Saint Francis here beside the port.
"
"Is this the way?
"
"Ay, marry, is't.
[p][A march afar]
[p]Hark you! they come this way.
[p]If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
[p]But till the troops come by,
[p]I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;
[p]The rather, for I think I know your hostess
[p]As ample as myself.
"
"Is it yourself?
"
"If you shall please so, pilgrim.
"
"I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
"
"You came, I think, from France?
"
"I did so.
"
"Here you shall see a countryman of yours
[p]That has done worthy service.
"
"His name, I pray you.
"
"The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
"
"But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:
[p]His face I know not.
"
"Whatsome'er he is,
[p]He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
[p]As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
[p]Against his liking: think you it is so?
"
"Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.
"
"There is a gentleman that serves the count
[p]Reports but coarsely of her.
"
"What's his name?
"
"Monsieur Parolles.
"
"O, I believe with him,
[p]In argument of praise, or to the worth
[p]Of the great count himself, she is too mean
[p]To have her name repeated: all her deserving
[p]Is a reserved honesty, and that
[p]I have not heard examined.
"
"Alas, poor lady!
[p]'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
[p]Of a detesting lord.
"
"I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,
[p]Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her
[p]A shrewd turn, if she pleased.
"
"How do you mean?
[p]May be the amorous count solicits her
[p]In the unlawful purpose.
"
"He does indeed;
[p]And brokes with all that can in such a suit
[p]Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
[p]But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
[p]In honestest defence.
"
"The gods forbid else!
"
"So, now they come:
[p][Drum and Colours]
[p][Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army]
[p]That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;
[p]That, Escalus.
"
"Which is the Frenchman?
"
"He;
[p]That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
[p]I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
[p]He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?
"
"I like him well.
"
"'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
[p]That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
[p]I would Poison that vile rascal.
"
"Which is he?
"
"That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?
"
"Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.
"
"Lose our drum! well.
"
"He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.
"
"Marry, hang you!
"
"And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
"
"The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
[p]Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents
[p]There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
[p]Already at my house.
"
"I humbly thank you:
[p]Please it this matron and this gentle maid
[p]To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
[p]Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
[p]I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
[p]Worthy the note.
"
"We'll take your offer kindly.
"
"Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his
[p]way.
"
"If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no
[p]more in your respect.
"
"On my life, my lord, a bubble.
"
"Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
"
"Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
[p]without any malice, but to speak of him as my
[p]kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
[p]endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
[p]of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
[p]entertainment.
"
"It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
[p]his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
[p]great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.
"
"I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
"
"None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
[p]which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
"
"I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
[p]surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
[p]knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
[p]him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
[p]is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
[p]we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
[p]present at his examination: if he do not, for the
[p]promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
[p]base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
[p]intelligence in his power against you, and that with
[p]the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
[p]trust my judgment in any thing.
"
"O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;
[p]he says he has a stratagem for't: when your
[p]lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to
[p]what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
[p]melted, if you give him not John Drum's
[p]entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
[p]Here he comes.
"
"[Aside to BERTRAM] O, for the love of laughter,
[p]hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch
[p]off his drum in any hand.
"
"How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
[p]disposition.
"
"A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.
"
"'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!
[p]There was excellent command,--to charge in with our
[p]horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
"
"That was not to be blamed in the command of the
[p]service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
[p]himself could not have prevented, if he had been
[p]there to command.
"
"Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
[p]dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
[p]not to be recovered.
"
"It might have been recovered.
"
"It might; but it is not now.
"
"It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
[p]service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
[p]performer, I would have that drum or another, or
[p]'hic jacet.'
"
"Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
[p]think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
[p]instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
[p]be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will
[p]grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
[p]speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
[p]and extend to you what further becomes his
[p]greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
[p]worthiness.
"
"By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
"
"But you must not now slumber in it.
"
"I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
[p]pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
[p]certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;
[p]and by midnight look to hear further from me.
"
"May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?
"
"I know not what the success will be, my lord; but
[p]the attempt I vow.
"
"I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of
[p]thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
"
"I love not many words.
"
"No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
[p]strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
[p]to undertake this business, which he knows is not to
[p]be done; damns himself to do and dares better be
[p]damned than to do't?
"
"You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it
[p]is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
[p]for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but
[p]when you find him out, you have him ever after.
"
"Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
[p]this that so seriously he does address himself unto?
"
"None in the world; but return with an invention and
[p]clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
[p]have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall
[p]to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.
"
"We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
[p]him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:
[p]when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a
[p]sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this
[p]very night.
"
"I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
"
"Your brother he shall go along with me.
"
"As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.
"
"Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
[p]The lass I spoke of.
"
"But you say she's honest.
"
"That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
[p]And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
[p]By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
[p]Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
[p]And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
[p]Will you go see her?
"
"With all my heart, my lord.
"
"If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
[p]I know not how I shall assure you further,
[p]But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
"
"Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,
[p]Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
[p]And would not put my reputation now
[p]In any staining act.
"
"Nor would I wish you.
[p]First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,
[p]And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
[p]Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
[p]By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
[p]Err in bestowing it.
"
"I should believe you:
[p]For you have show'd me that which well approves
[p]You're great in fortune.
"
"Take this purse of gold,
[p]And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
[p]Which I will over-pay and pay again
[p]When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
[p]Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
[p]Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
[p]As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
[p]Now his important blood will nought deny
[p]That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
[p]That downward hath succeeded in his house
[p]From son to son, some four or five descents
[p]Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
[p]In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
[p]To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
[p]Howe'er repented after.
"
"Now I see
[p]The bottom of your purpose.
"
"You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
[p]But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
[p]Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
[p]In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
[p]Herself most chastely absent: after this,
[p]To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
[p]To what is passed already.
"
"I have yielded:
[p]Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
[p]That time and place with this deceit so lawful
[p]May prove coherent. Every night he comes
[p]With musics of all sorts and songs composed
[p]To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
[p]To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
[p]As if his life lay on't.
"
"Why then to-night
[p]Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
[p]Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
[p]And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
[p]Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:
[p]But let's about it.
"
"He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
[p]When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
[p]language you will: though you understand it not
[p]yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to
[p]understand him, unless some one among us whom we
[p]must produce for an interpreter.
"
"Good captain, let me be the interpreter.
"
"Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?
"
"No, sir, I warrant you.
"
"But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
"
"E'en such as you speak to me.
"
"He must think us some band of strangers i' the
[p]adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
[p]all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every
[p]one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we
[p]speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to
[p]know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
[p]gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,
[p]interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,
[p]ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,
[p]and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
"
"Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
[p]time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
[p]done? It must be a very plausive invention that
[p]carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces
[p]have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
[p]my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the
[p]fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not
[p]daring the reports of my tongue.
"
"This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
[p]was guilty of.
"
"What the devil should move me to undertake the
[p]recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the
[p]impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
[p]must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in
[p]exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
[p]will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great
[p]ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the
[p]instance? Tongue, I must put you into a
[p]butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
[p]Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
"
"Is it possible he should know what he is, and be
[p]that he is?
"
"I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
[p]turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
"
"We cannot afford you so.
"
"Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
[p]stratagem.
"
"'Twould not do.
"
"Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.
"
"Hardly serve.
"
"Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
"
"How deep?
"
"Thirty fathom.
"
"Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
"
"I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
[p]I recovered it.
"
"You shall hear one anon.
"
"A drum now of the enemy's,--
"
"Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
"
"Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.
"
"O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.
"
"Boskos thromuldo boskos.
"
"I know you are the Muskos' regiment:
[p]And I shall lose my life for want of language;
[p]If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,
[p]Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll
[p]Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
"
"Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak
[p]thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy
[p]faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
"
"O!
"
"O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
"
"Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
"
"The general is content to spare thee yet;
[p]And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
[p]To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform
[p]Something to save thy life.
"
"O, let me live!
[p]And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
[p]Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that
[p]Which you will wonder at.
"
"But wilt thou faithfully?
"
"If I do not, damn me.
"
"Acordo linta.
[p]Come on; thou art granted space.
"
"Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,
[p]We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
[p]Till we do hear from them.
"
"Captain, I will.
"
"A' will betray us all unto ourselves:
[p]Inform on that.
"
"So I will, sir.
"
"Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
"
"They told me that your name was Fontibell.
"
"No, my good lord, Diana.
"
"Titled goddess;
[p]And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
[p]In your fine frame hath love no quality?
[p]If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
[p]You are no maiden, but a monument:
[p]When you are dead, you should be such a one
[p]As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
[p]And now you should be as your mother was
[p]When your sweet self was got.
"
"She then was honest.
"
"So should you be.
"
"No:
[p]My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
[p]As you owe to your wife.
"
"No more o' that;
[p]I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
[p]I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
[p]By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
[p]Do thee all rights of service.
"
"Ay, so you serve us
[p]Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
[p]You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
[p]And mock us with our bareness.
"
"How have I sworn!
"
"'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
[p]But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
[p]What is not holy, that we swear not by,
[p]But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
[p]If I should swear by God's great attributes,
[p]I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
[p]When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
[p]To swear by him whom I protest to love,
[p]That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
[p]Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
[p]At least in my opinion.
"
"Change it, change it;
[p]Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
[p]And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
[p]That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
[p]But give thyself unto my sick desires,
[p]Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
[p]My love as it begins shall so persever.
"
"I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
[p]That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
"
"I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
[p]To give it from me.
"
"Will you not, my lord?
"
"It is an honour 'longing to our house,
[p]Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
[p]Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
[p]In me to lose.
"
"Mine honour's such a ring:
[p]My chastity's the jewel of our house,
[p]Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
[p]Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
[p]In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
[p]Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
[p]Against your vain assault.
"
"Here, take my ring:
[p]My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
[p]And I'll be bid by thee.
"
"When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:
[p]I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
[p]Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
[p]When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
[p]Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
[p]My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
[p]When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
[p]And on your finger in the night I'll put
[p]Another ring, that what in time proceeds
[p]May token to the future our past deeds.
[p]Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
[p]A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
"
"A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
"
"For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
[p]You may so in the end.
[p]My mother told me just how he would woo,
[p]As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men
[p]Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
[p]When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
[p]When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
[p]Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
[p]Only in this disguise I think't no sin
[p]To cozen him that would unjustly win.
"
"You have not given him his mother's letter?
"
"I have delivered it an hour since: there is
[p]something in't that stings his nature; for on the
[p]reading it he changed almost into another man.
"
"He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
[p]off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
"
"Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
[p]displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his
[p]bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
[p]thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
"
"When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the
[p]grave of it.
"
"He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
[p]Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he
[p]fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
[p]given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself
[p]made in the unchaste composition.
"
"Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
[p]what things are we!
"
"Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
[p]of all treasons, we still see them reveal
[p]themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
[p]so he that in this action contrives against his own
[p]nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.
"
"Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
[p]our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
[p]company to-night?
"
"Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
"
"That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
[p]his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
[p]of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
[p]set this counterfeit.
"
"We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
[p]presence must be the whip of the other.
"
"In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?
"
"I hear there is an overture of peace.
"
"Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
"
"What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
[p]higher, or return again into France?
"
"I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
[p]of his council.
"
"Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal
[p]of his act.
"
"Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
[p]house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
[p]le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
[p]sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the
[p]tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
[p]grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
[p]now she sings in heaven.
"
"How is this justified?
"
"The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
[p]makes her story true, even to the point of her
[p]death: her death itself, which could not be her
[p]office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
[p]the rector of the place.
"
"Hath the count all this intelligence?
"
"Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
[p]point, so to the full arming of the verity.
"
"I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
"
"How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
"
"And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
[p]in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
[p]here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
[p]with a shame as ample.
"
"The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
[p]ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
[p]faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
[p]despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.
[p][Enter a Messenger]
[p]How now! where's your master?
"
"He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
[p]taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
[p]morning for France. The duke hath offered him
[p]letters of commendations to the king.
"
"They shall be no more than needful there, if they
[p]were more than they can commend.
"
"They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
[p]Here's his lordship now.
[p][Enter BERTRAM]
[p]How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?
"
"I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
[p]month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
[p]I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
[p]nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
[p]lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
[p]and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
[p]many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
[p]that I have not ended yet.
"
"If the business be of any difficulty, and this
[p]morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
[p]your lordship.
"
"I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
[p]hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
[p]dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
[p]bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
[p]me, like a double-meaning prophesier.
"
"Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
[p]poor gallant knave.
"
"No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
[p]his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
"
"I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
[p]him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
[p]he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
[p]hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
[p]to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
[p]this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
[p]stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?
"
"Nothing of me, has a'?
"
"His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
[p]face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you
[p]are, you must have the patience to hear it.
"
"A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
[p]me: hush, hush!
"
"Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa
"
"He calls for the tortures: what will you say
[p]without 'em?
"
"I will confess what I know without constraint: if
[p]ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
"
"Bosko chimurcho.
"
"Boblibindo chicurmurco.
"
"You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
[p]answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
"
"And truly, as I hope to live.
"
"[Reads] 'First demand of him how many horse the
[p]duke is strong.' What say you to that?
"
"Five or six thousand; but very weak and
[p]unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
[p]the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
[p]and credit and as I hope to live.
"
"Shall I set down your answer so?
"
"Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.
"
"All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
"
"You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
[p]Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
[p]phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
[p]knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
[p]his dagger.
"
"I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
[p]clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
[p]by wearing his apparel neatly.
"
"Well, that's set down.
"
"Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say
[p]true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.
"
"He's very near the truth in this.
"
"But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
[p]delivers it.
"
"Poor rogues, I pray you, say.
"
"Well, that's set down.
"
"I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
[p]rogues are marvellous poor.
"
"[Reads] 'Demand of him, of what strength they are
[p]a-foot.' What say you to that?
"
"By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
[p]hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
[p]hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
[p]many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
[p]and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
[p]company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
[p]fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
[p]sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
[p]poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
[p]their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.
"
"What shall be done to him?
"
"Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
[p]condition, and what credit I have with the duke.
"
"Well, that's set down.
[p][Reads]
[p]'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
[p]be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is
[p]with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
[p]expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not
[p]possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
[p]corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what
[p]do you know of it?
"
"I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
[p]the inter'gatories: demand them singly.
"
"Do you know this Captain Dumain?
"
"I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,
[p]from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
[p]fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not
[p]say him nay.
"
"Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
[p]his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
"
"Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?
"
"Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
"
"Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
[p]lordship anon.
"
"What is his reputation with the duke?
"
"The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
[p]of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
[p]out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.
"
"Marry, we'll search.
"
"In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
[p]or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
[p]in my tent.
"
"Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?
"
"I do not know if it be it or no.
"
"Our interpreter does it well.
"
"Excellently.
"
"[Reads] 'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--
"
"That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an
[p]advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
[p]Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
[p]Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
[p]ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.
"
"Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.
"
"My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
[p]behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
[p]a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
[p]virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.
"
"Damnable both-sides rogue!
"
"[Reads] 'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
[p]After he scores, he never pays the score:
[p]Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
[p]He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;
[p]And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
[p]Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
[p]For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
[p]Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
[p]Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
[p]PAROLLES.'
"
"He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
[p]in's forehead.
"
"This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
[p]linguist and the armipotent soldier.
"
"I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
[p]he's a cat to me.
"
"I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be
[p]fain to hang you.
"
"My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
[p]die; but that, my offences being many, I would
[p]repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
[p]sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.
"
"We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
[p]therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
[p]have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
[p]his valour: what is his honesty?
"
"He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
[p]rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
[p]professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
[p]is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
[p]such volubility, that you would think truth were a
[p]fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
[p]be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
[p]harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
[p]know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
[p]little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
[p]every thing that an honest man should not have; what
[p]an honest man should have, he has nothing.
"
"I begin to love him for this.
"
"For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
[p]him for me, he's more and more a cat.
"
"What say you to his expertness in war?
"
"Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
[p]tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
[p]his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
[p]he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
[p]called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
[p]files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
[p]this I am not certain.
"
"He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
[p]rarity redeems him.
"
"A pox on him, he's a cat still.
"
"His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
[p]to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
"
"Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple
[p]of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
[p]entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
[p]succession for it perpetually.
"
"What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
"
"Why does be ask him of me?
"
"What's he?
"
"E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so
[p]great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
[p]deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
[p]yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:
[p]in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming
[p]on he has the cramp.
"
"If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
[p]the Florentine?
"
"Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.
"
"I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.
"
"[Aside] I'll no more drumming; a plague of all
[p]drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
[p]beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
[p]the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
[p]would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
"
"There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
[p]general says, you that have so traitorously
[p]discovered the secrets of your army and made such
[p]pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can
[p]serve the world for no honest use; therefore you
[p]must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.
"
"O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
"
"That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.
[p][Unblinding him]
[p]So, look about you: know you any here?
"
"Good morrow, noble captain.
"
"God bless you, Captain Parolles.
"
"God save you, noble captain.
"
"Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?
[p]I am for France.
"
"Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
[p]you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
[p]an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:
[p]but fare you well.
"
"You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that
[p]has a knot on't yet
"
"Who cannot be crushed with a plot?
"
"If you could find out a country where but women were
[p]that had received so much shame, you might begin an
[p]impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France
[p]too: we shall speak of you there.
"
"Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,
[p]'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
[p]But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
[p]As captain shall: simply the thing I am
[p]Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
[p]Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
[p]that every braggart shall be found an ass.
[p]Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
[p]Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!
[p]There's place and means for every man alive.
[p]I'll after them.
"
"That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,
[p]One of the greatest in the Christian world
[p]Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,
[p]Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
[p]Time was, I did him a desired office,
[p]Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
[p]Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
[p]And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd
[p]His grace is at Marseilles; to which place
[p]We have convenient convoy. You must know
[p]I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
[p]My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
[p]And by the leave of my good lord the king,
[p]We'll be before our welcome.
"
"Gentle madam,
[p]You never had a servant to whose trust
[p]Your business was more welcome.
"
"Nor you, mistress,
[p]Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
[p]To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven
[p]Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
[p]As it hath fated her to be my motive
[p]And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
[p]That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
[p]When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
[p]Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play
[p]With what it loathes for that which is away.
[p]But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
[p]Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
[p]Something in my behalf.
"
"Let death and honesty
[p]Go with your impositions, I am yours
[p]Upon your will to suffer.
"
"Yet, I pray you:
[p]But with the word the time will bring on summer,
[p]When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
[p]And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
[p]Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:
[p]All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;
[p]Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.
"
"No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
[p]fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
[p]made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
[p]his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
[p]this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
[p]by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.
"
"I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
[p]most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
[p]praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
[p]flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
[p]could not have owed her a more rooted love.
"
"'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
[p]thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.
"
"Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
[p]salad, or rather, the herb of grace.
"
"They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
"
"I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
[p]skill in grass.
"
"Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?
"
"A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
"
"Your distinction?
"
"I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.
"
"So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
"
"And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
"
"I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.
"
"At your service.
"
"No, no, no.
"
"Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
[p]great a prince as you are.
"
"Who's that? a Frenchman?
"
"Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
[p]is more hotter in France than there.
"
"What prince is that?
"
"The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
[p]darkness; alias, the devil.
"
"Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
[p]to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
[p]serve him still.
"
"I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
[p]great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
[p]good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
[p]world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
[p]the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
[p]too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
[p]themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
[p]tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
[p]leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
"
"Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
[p]tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
[p]with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
[p]looked to, without any tricks.
"
"If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
[p]jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.
"
"A shrewd knave and an unhappy.
"
"So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
[p]sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
[p]which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
[p]indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.
"
"I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
[p]tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
[p]that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
[p]moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
[p]my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
[p]his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
[p]first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
[p]it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
[p]conceived against your son, there is no fitter
[p]matter. How does your ladyship like it?
"
"With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
[p]happily effected.
"
"His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
[p]body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
[p]to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
[p]intelligence hath seldom failed.
"
"It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
[p]die. I have letters that my son will be here
[p]to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
[p]with me till they meet together.
"
"Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
[p]safely be admitted.
"
"You need but plead your honourable privilege.
"
"Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
[p]thank my God it holds yet.
"
"O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
[p]velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
[p]or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
[p]velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
[p]half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
"
"A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
[p]of honour; so belike is that.
"
"But it is your carbonadoed face.
"
"Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
[p]with the young noble soldier.
"
"Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
[p]hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
[p]and nod at every man.
"
"But this exceeding posting day and night
[p]Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:
[p]But since you have made the days and nights as one,
[p]To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
[p]Be bold you do so grow in my requital
[p]As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;
[p][Enter a Gentleman]
[p]This man may help me to his majesty's ear,
[p]If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.
"
"And you.
"
"Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
"
"I have been sometimes there.
"
"I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
[p]From the report that goes upon your goodness;
[p]An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
[p]Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
[p]The use of your own virtues, for the which
[p]I shall continue thankful.
"
"What's your will?
"
"That it will please you
[p]To give this poor petition to the king,
[p]And aid me with that store of power you have
[p]To come into his presence.
"
"The king's not here.
"
"Not here, sir!
"
"Not, indeed:
[p]He hence removed last night and with more haste
[p]Than is his use.
"
"Lord, how we lose our pains!
"
"ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,
[p]Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
[p]I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
"
"Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
[p]Whither I am going.
"
"I do beseech you, sir,
[p]Since you are like to see the king before me,
[p]Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
[p]Which I presume shall render you no blame
[p]But rather make you thank your pains for it.
[p]I will come after you with what good speed
[p]Our means will make us means.
"
"This I'll do for you.
"
"And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
[p]Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.
[p]Go, go, provide.
"
"Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this
[p]letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to
[p]you, when I have held familiarity with fresher
[p]clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's
[p]mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
[p]displeasure.
"
"Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it
[p]smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will
[p]henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.
[p]Prithee, allow the wind.
"
"Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake
[p]but by a metaphor.
"
"Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my
[p]nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get
[p]thee further.
"
"Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
"
"Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's
[p]close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he
[p]comes himself.
[p][Enter LAFEU]
[p]Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's
[p]cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the
[p]unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he
[p]says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the
[p]carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
[p]ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his
[p]distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to
[p]your lordship.
"
"My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly
[p]scratched.
"
"And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to
[p]pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the
[p]knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
[p]of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves
[p]thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for
[p]you: let the justices make you and fortune friends:
[p]I am for other business.
"
"I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
"
"You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;
[p]save your word.
"
"My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
"
"You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion!
[p]give me your hand. How does your drum?
"
"O my good lord, you were the first that found me!
"
"Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.
"
"It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,
[p]for you did bring me out.
"
"Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once
[p]both the office of God and the devil? One brings
[p]thee in grace and the other brings thee out.
[p][Trumpets sound]
[p]The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,
[p]inquire further after me; I had talk of you last
[p]night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall
[p]eat; go to, follow.
"
"I praise God for you.
"
"We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem
[p]Was made much poorer by it: but your son,
[p]As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
[p]Her estimation home.
"
"'Tis past, my liege;
[p]And I beseech your majesty to make it
[p]Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;
[p]When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
[p]O'erbears it and burns on.
"
"My honour'd lady,
[p]I have forgiven and forgotten all;
[p]Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
[p]And watch'd the time to shoot.
"
"This I must say,
[p]But first I beg my pardon, the young lord
[p]Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady
[p]Offence of mighty note; but to himself
[p]The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
[p]Whose beauty did astonish the survey
[p]Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
[p]Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
[p]Humbly call'd mistress.
"
"Praising what is lost
[p]Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
[p]We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
[p]All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;
[p]The nature of his great offence is dead,
[p]And deeper than oblivion we do bury
[p]The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
[p]A stranger, no offender; and inform him
[p]So 'tis our will he should.
"
"I shall, my liege.
"
"What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?
"
"All that he is hath reference to your highness.
"
"Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
[p]That set him high in fame.
"
"I am not a day of season,
[p]For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
[p]In me at once: but to the brightest beams
[p]Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
[p]The time is fair again.
"
"My high-repented blames,
[p]Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
"
"All is whole;
[p]Not one word more of the consumed time.
[p]Let's take the instant by the forward top;
[p]For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
[p]The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
[p]Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
[p]The daughter of this lord?
"
"Admiringly, my liege, at first
[p]I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
[p]Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
[p]Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
[p]Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
[p]Which warp'd the line of every other favour;
[p]Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
[p]Extended or contracted all proportions
[p]To a most hideous object: thence it came
[p]That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
[p]Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
[p]The dust that did offend it.
"
"Well excused:
[p]That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
[p]From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
[p]Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
[p]To the great sender turns a sour offence,
[p]Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
[p]Make trivial price of serious things we have,
[p]Not knowing them until we know their grave:
[p]Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
[p]Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
[p]Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
[p]While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
[p]Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
[p]Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
[p]The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
[p]To see our widower's second marriage-day.
"
"Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
[p]Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
"
"Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
[p]Must be digested, give a favour from you
[p]To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
[p]That she may quickly come.
[p][BERTRAM gives a ring]
[p]By my old beard,
[p]And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,
[p]Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
[p]The last that e'er I took her at court,
[p]I saw upon her finger.
"
"Hers it was not.
"
"Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
[p]While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
[p]This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
[p]I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
[p]Necessitied to help, that by this token
[p]I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
[p]her
[p]Of what should stead her most?
"
"My gracious sovereign,
[p]Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
[p]The ring was never hers.
"
"Son, on my life,
[p]I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
[p]At her life's rate.
"
"I am sure I saw her wear it.
"
"You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
[p]In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
[p]Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
[p]Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
[p]I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
[p]To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
[p]I could not answer in that course of honour
[p]As she had made the overture, she ceased
[p]In heavy satisfaction and would never
[p]Receive the ring again.
"
"Plutus himself,
[p]That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
[p]Hath not in nature's mystery more science
[p]Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
[p]Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
[p]That you are well acquainted with yourself,
[p]Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
[p]You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
[p]That she would never put it from her finger,
[p]Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
[p]Where you have never come, or sent it us
[p]Upon her great disaster.
"
"She never saw it.
"
"Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
[p]And makest conjectural fears to come into me
[p]Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
[p]That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--
[p]And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
[p]And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
[p]Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
[p]More than to see this ring. Take him away.
[p][Guards seize BERTRAM]
[p]My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
[p]Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
[p]Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!
[p]We'll sift this matter further.
"
"If you shall prove
[p]This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
[p]Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
[p]Where yet she never was.
"
"I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.
"
"Gracious sovereign,
[p]Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
[p]Here's a petition from a Florentine,
[p]Who hath for four or five removes come short
[p]To tender it herself. I undertook it,
[p]Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
[p]Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
[p]Is here attending: her business looks in her
[p]With an importing visage; and she told me,
[p]In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
[p]Your highness with herself.
"
"[Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry me
[p]when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
[p]me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows
[p]are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He
[p]stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
[p]him to his country for justice: grant it me, O
[p]king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer
[p]flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
[p]DIANA CAPILET.
"
"I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
[p]this: I'll none of him.
"
"The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
[p]To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:
[p]Go speedily and bring again the count.
[p]I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
[p]Was foully snatch'd.
"
"Now, justice on the doers!
"
"I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
[p]And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
[p]Yet you desire to marry.
[p][Enter Widow and DIANA]
[p]What woman's that?
"
"I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
[p]Derived from the ancient Capilet:
[p]My suit, as I do understand, you know,
[p]And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
"
"I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
[p]Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
[p]And both shall cease, without your remedy.
"
"Come hither, count; do you know these women?
"
"My lord, I neither can nor will deny
[p]But that I know them: do they charge me further?
"
"Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
"
"She's none of mine, my lord.
"
"If you shall marry,
[p]You give away this hand, and that is mine;
[p]You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
[p]You give away myself, which is known mine;
[p]For I by vow am so embodied yours,
[p]That she which marries you must marry me,
[p]Either both or none.
"
"Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you
[p]are no husband for her.
"
"My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
[p]Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness
[p]Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
[p]Than for to think that I would sink it here.
"
"Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
[p]Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
[p]Than in my thought it lies.
"
"Good my lord,
[p]Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
[p]He had not my virginity.
"
"What say'st thou to her?
"
"She's impudent, my lord,
[p]And was a common gamester to the camp.
"
"He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
[p]He might have bought me at a common price:
[p]Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
[p]Whose high respect and rich validity
[p]Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
[p]He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
[p]If I be one.
"
"He blushes, and 'tis it:
[p]Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
[p]Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
[p]Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
[p]That ring's a thousand proofs.
"
"Methought you said
[p]You saw one here in court could witness it.
"
"I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
[p]So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.
"
"I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
"
"Find him, and bring him hither.
"
"What of him?
[p]He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
[p]With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;
[p]Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
[p]Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
[p]That will speak any thing?
"
"She hath that ring of yours.
"
"I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
[p]And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
[p]She knew her distance and did angle for me,
[p]Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
[p]As all impediments in fancy's course
[p]Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
[p]Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
[p]Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
[p]And I had that which any inferior might
[p]At market-price have bought.
"
"I must be patient:
[p]You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
[p]May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
[p]Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
[p]Send for your ring, I will return it home,
[p]And give me mine again.
"
"I have it not.
"
"What ring was yours, I pray you?
"
"Sir, much like
[p]The same upon your finger.
"
"Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
"
"And this was it I gave him, being abed.
"
"The story then goes false, you threw it him
[p]Out of a casement.
"
"I have spoke the truth.
"
"My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
"
"You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
[p]Is this the man you speak of?
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
[p]Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
[p]Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
[p]By him and by this woman here what know you?
"
"So please your majesty, my master hath been an
[p]honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
[p]which gentlemen have.
"
"Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?
"
"Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
"
"How, I pray you?
"
"He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
"
"How is that?
"
"He loved her, sir, and loved her not.
"
"As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
[p]equivocal companion is this!
"
"I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.
"
"He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
"
"Do you know he promised me marriage?
"
"Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
"
"But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?
"
"Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
[p]as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for
[p]indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
[p]of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
[p]was in that credit with them at that time that I
[p]knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
[p]as promising her marriage, and things which would
[p]derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
[p]speak what I know.
"
"Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
[p]they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
[p]evidence; therefore stand aside.
[p]This ring, you say, was yours?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?
"
"It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
"
"Who lent it you?
"
"It was not lent me neither.
"
"Where did you find it, then?
"
"I found it not.
"
"If it were yours by none of all these ways,
[p]How could you give it him?
"
"I never gave it him.
"
"This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off
[p]and on at pleasure.
"
"This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.
"
"It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
"
"Take her away; I do not like her now;
[p]To prison with her: and away with him.
[p]Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
[p]Thou diest within this hour.
"
"I'll never tell you.
"
"Take her away.
"
"I'll put in bail, my liege.
"
"I think thee now some common customer.
"
"By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
"
"Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?
"
"Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
[p]He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
[p]I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
[p]Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
[p]I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
"
"She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.
"
"Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:
[p][Exit Widow]
[p]The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
[p]And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
[p]Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
[p]Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
[p]He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
[p]And at that time he got his wife with child:
[p]Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
[p]So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
[p]And now behold the meaning.
"
"Is there no exorcist
[p]Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
[p]Is't real that I see?
"
"No, my good lord;
[p]'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
[p]The name and not the thing.
"
"Both, both. O, pardon!
"
"O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
[p]I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
[p]And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
[p]'When from my finger you can get this ring
[p]And are by me with child,' &c. This is done:
[p]Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?
"
"If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
[p]I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
"
"If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
[p]Deadly divorce step between me and you!
[p]O my dear mother, do I see you living?
"
"Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:
[p][To PAROLLES]
[p]Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
[p]I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
[p]Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.
"
"Let us from point to point this story know,
[p]To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
[p][To DIANA]
[p]If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
[p]Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
[p]For I can guess that by thy honest aid
[p]Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
[p]Of that and all the progress, more or less,
[p]Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
[p]All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
[p]The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

"
"As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
[p]me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
[p]charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
[p]begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
[p]report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
[p]rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
[p]home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
[p]birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
[p]bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
[p]they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
[p]hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
[p]the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
[p]as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
[p]something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
[p]me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
[p]brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
[p]education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
[p]my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
[p]this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
[p]wise remedy how to avoid it.
"
"Yonder comes my master, your brother.
"
"Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
[p]up.
"
"Now, sir! what make you here?
"
"Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.
"
"What mar you then, sir?
"
"Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a
[p]poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
"
"Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.
"
"Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What
[p]prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
"
"Know you where you are, sir?
"
"O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
"
"Know you before whom, sir?
"
"Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are
[p]my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you
[p]should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better
[p]in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not
[p]away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as
[p]much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming
[p]before me is nearer to his reverence.
"
"What, boy!                               [Strikes him]
"
"Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
"
"Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
"
"I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
[p]Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
[p]a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not
[p]take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
[p]tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.
"
"[Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
[p]remembrance, be at accord.
"
"Let me go, I say.
"
"I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father
[p]charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have
[p]train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
[p]gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
[p]me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such
[p]exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor
[p]allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy
[p]my fortunes.
"
"And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,
[p]get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have
[p]some part of your will. I pray you leave me.
"
"I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
"
"Get you with him, you old dog.
"
"Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
[p]your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke
[p]such a word.

"
"Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic
[p]your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla,
[p]Dennis!
"
"Calls your worship?
"
"Was not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
"
"So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access
[p]to you.
"
"Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and
[p]to-morrow the wrestling is.
"
"Good morrow to your worship.
"
"Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new
[p]court?
"
"There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
[p]is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke;
[p]and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
[p]exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;
[p]therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
"
"Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished
[p]with her father?
"
"O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
[p]being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have
[p]followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at
[p]the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
[p]daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
"
"Where will the old Duke live?
"
"They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many
[p]merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood
[p]of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,
[p]and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
"
"What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?
"
"Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
[p]matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
[p]brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
[p]me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he
[p]that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
[p]Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would
[p]be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come
[p]in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint
[p]you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,
[p]or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is
[p]thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
"
"Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt
[p]find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my
[p]brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to
[p]dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,
[p]Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of
[p]ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret
[p]and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
[p]Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his
[p]neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou
[p]dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
[p]himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap
[p]thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he
[p]hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I
[p]assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one
[p]so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly
[p]of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush
[p]and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
"
"I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
[p]to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,
[p]I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!  Exit
"
"Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I
[p]hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
[p]hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and
[p]yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
[p]beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and
[p]especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am
[p]altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
[p]shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy
[p]thither, which now I'll go about.                  Exit
"
"I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
"
"Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and
[p]would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget
[p]a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any
[p]extraordinary pleasure.
"
"Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
[p]love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
[p]uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I
[p]could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst
[p]thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd
[p]as mine is to thee.
"
"Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
[p]rejoice in yours.
"
"You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
[p]have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
[p]he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee
[p]again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that
[p]oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear
[p]Rose, be merry.
"
"From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
[p]Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
"
"Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
[p]in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety
[p]of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
"
"What shall be our sport, then?
"
"Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
[p]wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
"
"I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
[p]misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
[p]gifts to women.
"
"'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
[p]honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
[p]ill-favouredly.
"
"Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
[p]Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
[p]Nature.
"
"No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
[p]Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to
[p]flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
[p]the argument?
"
"Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
[p]Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.
"
"Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
[p]Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
[p]such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
[p]always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How
[p]now, wit! Whither wander you?
"
"Mistress, you must come away to your father.
"
"Were you made the messenger?
"
"No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
"
"Where learned you that oath, fool?
"
"Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
[p]good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.
[p]Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard
[p]was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
"
"How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
"
"Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
"
"Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
[p]by your beards that I am a knave.
"
"By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
"
"By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you
[p]swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
[p]knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he
[p]had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
[p]that mustard.
"
"Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
"
"One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
"
"My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no
[p]more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.
"
"The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
[p]men do foolishly.
"
"By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
[p]fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
[p]makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
"
"With his mouth full of news.
"
"Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
"
"Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
"
"All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,
[p]Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?
"
"Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
"
"Sport! of what colour?
"
"What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
"
"As wit and fortune will.
"
"Or as the Destinies decrees.
"
"Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
"
"Nay, if I keep not my rank-
"
"Thou losest thy old smell.
"
"You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good
[p]wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
"
"Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
"
"I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
[p]ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and
[p]here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
"
"Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
"
"There comes an old man and his three sons-
"
"I could match this beginning with an old tale.
"
"Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
"
"With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by
[p]these presents'-
"
"The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
[p]wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
[p]his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv'd
[p]the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
[p]their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the
[p]beholders take his part with weeping.
"
"Alas!
"
"But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
[p]lost?
"
"Why, this that I speak of.
"
"Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time
[p]that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
"
"Or I, I promise thee.
"
"But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
[p]his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we
[p]see this wrestling, cousin?
"
"You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
[p]appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
"
"Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.
"
"Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own
[p]peril on his forwardness.
"
"Is yonder the man?
"
"Even he, madam.
"
"Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.
"
"How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to
[p]see the wrestling?
"
"Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
"
"You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,
[p]there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth
[p]I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to
[p]him, ladies; see if you can move him.
"
"Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
"
"Do so; I'll not be by.
[p]                                 [DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]
"
"Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.
"
"I attend them with all respect and duty.
"
"Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
"
"No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come
[p]but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
"
"Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
[p]You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw
[p]yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the
[p]fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
[p]enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own
[p]safety and give over this attempt.
"
"Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be
[p]misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the
[p]wrestling might not go forward.
"
"I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,
[p]wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent
[p]ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
[p]with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one
[p]sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is
[p]willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none
[p]to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only
[p]in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when
[p]I have made it empty.
"
"The little strength that I have, I would it were with
[p]you.
"
"And mine to eke out hers.
"
"Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!
"
"Your heart's desires be with you!
"
"Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
[p]lie with his mother earth?
"
"Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
"
"You shall try but one fall.
"
"No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a
[p]second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
"
"You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me
[p]before; but come your ways.
"
"Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!
"
"I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the
[p]leg.                                     [They wrestle]
"
"O excellent young man!
"
"If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should
[p]down.
"
"No more, no more.
"
"Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
"
"How dost thou, Charles?
"
"He cannot speak, my lord.
"
"Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
"
"Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
[p]Boys.
"
"I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
[p]The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
[p]But I did find him still mine enemy.
[p]Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,
[p]Hadst thou descended from another house.
[p]But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth;
[p]I would thou hadst told me of another father.
"
"Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
"
"I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
[p]His youngest son- and would not change that calling
[p]To be adopted heir to Frederick.
"
"My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,
[p]And all the world was of my father's mind;
[p]Had I before known this young man his son,
[p]I should have given him tears unto entreaties
[p]Ere he should thus have ventur'd.
"
"Gentle cousin,
[p]Let us go thank him, and encourage him;
[p]My father's rough and envious disposition
[p]Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserv'd;
[p]If you do keep your promises in love
[p]But justly as you have exceeded all promise,
[p]Your mistress shall be happy.
"
"Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]
[p]Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,
[p]That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
[p]Shall we go, coz?
"
"Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
"
"Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts
[p]Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up
[p]Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
"
"He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;
[p]I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
[p]Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown
[p]More than your enemies.
"
"Will you go, coz?
"
"Have with you. Fare you well.
"
"What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
[p]I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.
[p]O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
[p]Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
"
"Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
[p]To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd
[p]High commendation, true applause, and love,
[p]Yet such is now the Duke's condition
[p]That he misconstrues all that you have done.
[p]The Duke is humorous; what he is, indeed,
[p]More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
"
"I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
[p]Which of the two was daughter of the Duke
[p]That here was at the wrestling?
"
"Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
[p]But yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter;
[p]The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,
[p]And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
[p]To keep his daughter company; whose loves
[p]Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
[p]But I can tell you that of late this Duke
[p]Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
[p]Grounded upon no other argument
[p]But that the people praise her for her virtues
[p]And pity her for her good father's sake;
[p]And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
[p]Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.
[p]Hereafter, in a better world than this,
[p]I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
"
"I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.
[p][Exit LE BEAU]
[p]Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
[p]From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.
[p]But heavenly Rosalind!                                  Exit
"
"Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy!
[p]Not a word?
"
"Not one to throw at a dog.
"
"No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;
[p]throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
"
"Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should
[p]be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any.
"
"But is all this for your father?
"
"No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of
[p]briers is this working-day world!
"
"They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
[p]foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats
[p]will catch them.
"
"I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my
[p]heart.
"
"Hem them away.
"
"I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
"
"Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
"
"O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
"
"O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of
[p]a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in
[p]good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall
[p]into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
"
"The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
"
"Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
[p]By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his
[p]father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.
"
"No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
"
"Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
"
"Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I
[p]do. Look, here comes the Duke.
"
"With his eyes full of anger.
"
"Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
[p]And get you from our court.
"
"Me, uncle?
"
"You, cousin.
[p]Within these ten days if that thou beest found
[p]So near our public court as twenty miles,
[p]Thou diest for it.
"
"I do beseech your Grace,
[p]Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
[p]If with myself I hold intelligence,
[p]Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;
[p]If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-
[p]As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,
[p]Never so much as in a thought unborn
[p]Did I offend your Highness.
"
"Thus do all traitors;
[p]If their purgation did consist in words,
[p]They are as innocent as grace itself.
[p]Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
"
"Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
[p]Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
"
"Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
"
"So was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
[p]So was I when your Highness banish'd him.
[p]Treason is not inherited, my lord;
[p]Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
[p]What's that to me? My father was no traitor.
[p]Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
[p]To think my poverty is treacherous.
"
"Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
"
"Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
[p]Else had she with her father rang'd along.
"
"I did not then entreat to have her stay;
[p]It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;
[p]I was too young that time to value her,
[p]But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
[p]Why so am I: we still have slept together,
[p]Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;
[p]And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
[p]Still we went coupled and inseparable.
"
"She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
[p]Her very silence and her patience,
[p]Speak to the people, and they pity her.
[p]Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;
[p]And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
[p]When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
[p]Firm and irrevocable is my doom
[p]Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
"
"Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
[p]I cannot live out of her company.
"
"You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
[p]If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
[p]And in the greatness of my word, you die.
"
"O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
[p]Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
[p]I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am.
"
"I have more cause.
"
"Thou hast not, cousin.
[p]Prithee be cheerful. Know'st thou not the Duke
[p]Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
"
"That he hath not.
"
"No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
[p]Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
[p]Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?
[p]No; let my father seek another heir.
[p]Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
[p]Whither to go, and what to bear with us;
[p]And do not seek to take your charge upon you,
[p]To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;
[p]For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
[p]Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
"
"Why, whither shall we go?
"
"To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
"
"Alas, what danger will it be to us,
[p]Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
[p]Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
"
"I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
[p]And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
[p]The like do you; so shall we pass along,
[p]And never stir assailants.
"
"Were it not better,
[p]Because that I am more than common tall,
[p]That I did suit me all points like a man?
[p]A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
[p]A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
[p]Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-
[p]We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
[p]As many other mannish cowards have
[p]That do outface it with their semblances.
"
"What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
"
"I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
[p]And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
[p]But what will you be call'd?
"
"Something that hath a reference to my state:
[p]No longer Celia, but Aliena.
"
"But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
[p]The clownish fool out of your father's court?
[p]Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
"
"He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
[p]Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
[p]And get our jewels and our wealth together;
[p]Devise the fittest time and safest way
[p]To hide us from pursuit that will be made
[p]After my flight. Now go we in content
[p]To liberty, and not to banishment.               Exeunt
"
"Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
[p]Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
[p]Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
[p]More free from peril than the envious court?
[p]Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
[p]The seasons' difference; as the icy fang
[p]And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
[p]Which when it bites and blows upon my body,
[p]Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
[p]'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
[p]That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
[p]Sweet are the uses of adversity,
[p]Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
[p]Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
[p]And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
[p]Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
[p]Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
[p]I would not change it.
"
"Happy is your Grace,
[p]That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
[p]Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
"
"Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
[p]And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
[p]Being native burghers of this desert city,
[p]Should, in their own confines, with forked heads
[p]Have their round haunches gor'd.
"
"Indeed, my lord,
[p]The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;
[p]And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
[p]Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
[p]To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
[p]Did steal behind him as he lay along
[p]Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
[p]Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
[p]To the which place a poor sequest'red stag,
[p]That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
[p]Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
[p]The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
[p]That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
[p]Almost to bursting; and the big round tears
[p]Cours'd one another down his innocent nose
[p]In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
[p]Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
[p]Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
[p]Augmenting it with tears.
"
"But what said Jaques?
[p]Did he not moralize this spectacle?
"
"O, yes, into a thousand similes.
[p]First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
[p]'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
[p]As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
[p]To that which had too much.' Then, being there alone,
[p]Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
[p]'Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part
[p]The flux of company.' Anon, a careless herd,
[p]Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
[p]And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques
[p]'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
[p]'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
[p]Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
[p]Thus most invectively he pierceth through
[p]The body of the country, city, court,
[p]Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we
[p]Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
[p]To fright the animals, and to kill them up
[p]In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
"
"And did you leave him in this contemplation?
"
"We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
[p]Upon the sobbing deer.
"
"Show me the place;
[p]I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
[p]For then he's full of matter.
"
"I'll bring you to him straight.        Exeunt
"
"Can it be possible that no man saw them?
[p]It cannot be; some villains of my court
[p]Are of consent and sufferance in this.
"
"I cannot hear of any that did see her.
[p]The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
[p]Saw her abed, and in the morning early
[p]They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.
"
"My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
[p]Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
[p]Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,
[p]Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
[p]Your daughter and her cousin much commend
[p]The parts and graces of the wrestler
[p]That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
[p]And she believes, wherever they are gone,
[p]That youth is surely in their company.
"
"Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.
[p]If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
[p]I'll make him find him. Do this suddenly;
[p]And let not search and inquisition quail
[p]To bring again these foolish runaways.           Exeunt
"
"Who's there?
"
"What, my young master? O my gentle master!
[p]O my sweet master! O you memory
[p]Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
[p]Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
[p]And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
[p]Why would you be so fond to overcome
[p]The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?
[p]Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
[p]Know you not, master, to some kind of men
[p]Their graces serve them but as enemies?
[p]No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
[p]Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
[p]O, what a world is this, when what is comely
[p]Envenoms him that bears it!
"
"Why, what's the matter?
"
"O unhappy youth!
[p]Come not within these doors; within this roof
[p]The enemy of all your graces lives.
[p]Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
[p]Yet not the son; I will not call him son
[p]Of him I was about to call his father-
[p]Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
[p]To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
[p]And you within it. If he fail of that,
[p]He will have other means to cut you off;
[p]I overheard him and his practices.
[p]This is no place; this house is but a butchery;
[p]Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
"
"Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
"
"No matter whither, so you come not here.
"
"What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
[p]Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
[p]A thievish living on the common road?
[p]This I must do, or know not what to do;
[p]Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
[p]I rather will subject me to the malice
[p]Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
"
"But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
[p]The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,
[p]Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,
[p]When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
[p]And unregarded age in corners thrown.
[p]Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
[p]Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
[p]Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
[p]All this I give you. Let me be your servant;
[p]Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
[p]For in my youth I never did apply
[p]Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
[p]Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
[p]The means of weakness and debility;
[p]Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
[p]Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you;
[p]I'll do the service of a younger man
[p]In all your business and necessities.
"
"O good old man, how well in thee appears
[p]The constant service of the antique world,
[p]When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
[p]Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
[p]Where none will sweat but for promotion,
[p]And having that do choke their service up
[p]Even with the having; it is not so with thee.
[p]But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree
[p]That cannot so much as a blossom yield
[p]In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
[p]But come thy ways, we'll go along together,
[p]And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
[p]We'll light upon some settled low content.
"
"Master, go on; and I will follow thee
[p]To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
[p]From seventeen years till now almost four-score
[p]Here lived I, but now live here no more.
[p]At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
[p]But at fourscore it is too late a week;
[p]Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
[p]Than to die well and not my master's debtor.     Exeunt
"
"O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
"
"I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
"
"I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel,
[p]and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as
[p]doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat;
[p]therefore, courage, good Aliena.
"
"I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.
"
"For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;
[p]yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you; for I think you
[p]have no money in your purse.
"
"Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
"
"Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at
[p]home I was in a better place; but travellers must be content.
"
"Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a
[p]young man and an old in solemn talk.
"
"That is the way to make her scorn you still.
"
"O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
"
"I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
"
"No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
[p]Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
[p]As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.
[p]But if thy love were ever like to mine,
[p]As sure I think did never man love so,
[p]How many actions most ridiculous
[p]Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
"
"Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
"
"O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
[p]If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
[p]That ever love did make thee run into,
[p]Thou hast not lov'd;
[p]Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
[p]Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
[p]Thou hast not lov'd;
[p]Or if thou hast not broke from company
[p]Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
[p]Thou hast not lov'd.
[p]O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius
"
"Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
[p]I have by hard adventure found mine own.
"
"And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my
[p]sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to
[p]Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the
[p]cow's dugs that her pretty chapt hands had milk'd; and I remember
[p]the wooing of peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods,
[p]and giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these
[p]for my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers;
[p]but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal
[p]in folly.
"
"Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
"
"Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
[p]my shins against it.
"
"Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
[p]Is much upon my fashion.
"
"And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
"
"I pray you, one of you question yond man
[p]If he for gold will give us any food;
[p]I faint almost to death.
"
"Holla, you clown!
"
"Peace, fool; he's not thy kinsman.
"
"Who calls?
"
"Your betters, sir.
"
"Else are they very wretched.
"
"Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
"
"And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
"
"I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
[p]Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
[p]Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
[p]Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,
[p]And faints for succour.
"
"Fair sir, I pity her,
[p]And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
[p]My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
[p]But I am shepherd to another man,
[p]And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
[p]My master is of churlish disposition,
[p]And little recks to find the way to heaven
[p]By doing deeds of hospitality.
[p]Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,
[p]Are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,
[p]By reason of his absence, there is nothing
[p]That you will feed on; but what is, come see,
[p]And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
"
"What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
"
"That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
[p]That little cares for buying any thing.
"
"I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
[p]Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
[p]And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
"
"And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
[p]And willingly could waste my time in it.
"
"Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
[p]Go with me; if you like upon report
[p]The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
[p]I will your very faithful feeder be,
[p]And buy it with your gold right suddenly.        Exeunt

"Under the greenwood tree
[p]           Who loves to lie with me,

"Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
[p]will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look
[p]you.

[p]          [All together here]
[p]       Who doth ambition shun,
[p]       And loves to live i' th' sun,
[p]       Seeking the food he eats,

[p]     Come hither, come hither, come hither.

"I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
[p]despite of my invention.
"
"And I'll sing it.
"
"Thus it goes:
[p]         If it do come to pass
[p]         That any man turn ass,
[p]         Leaving his wealth and ease
[p]         A stubborn will to please,
[p]       Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
[p]         Here shall he see
[p]         Gross fools as he,
[p]         An if he will come to me.
"
"What's that 'ducdame'?
"
"'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I'll

"Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie
[p]I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.

"Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
[p]little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth
[p]forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or
[p]bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
[p]powers. For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the
[p]arm's end. I will here be with thee presently; and if I bring thee
[p]not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou
[p]diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
[p]thou look'st cheerly; and I'll be with thee quickly. Yet thou
[p]liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter;
[p]and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live
[p]anything in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam!          Exeunt
"
"I think he be transform'd into a beast;
[p]For I can nowhere find him like a man.
"
"My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
[p]Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
"
"If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
[p]We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
[p]Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.
"
"He saves my labour by his own approach.
"
"Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
[p]That your poor friends must woo your company?
[p]What, you look merrily!
"
"A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,
[p]A motley fool. A miserable world!
[p]As I do live by food, I met a fool,
[p]Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
[p]And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
[p]In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.
[p]'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,
[p]'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'
[p]And then he drew a dial from his poke,
[p]And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
[p]Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;
[p]Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;
[p]'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
[p]And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
[p]And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
[p]And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
[p]And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
[p]The motley fool thus moral on the time,
[p]My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
[p]That fools should be so deep contemplative;
[p]And I did laugh sans intermission
[p]An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
[p]A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
"
"What fool is this?
"
"O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
[p]And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
[p]They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
[p]Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
[p]After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
[p]With observation, the which he vents
[p]In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
[p]I am ambitious for a motley coat.
"
"Thou shalt have one.
"
"It is my only suit,
[p]Provided that you weed your better judgments
[p]Of all opinion that grows rank in them
[p]That I am wise. I must have liberty
[p]Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
[p]To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;
[p]And they that are most galled with my folly,
[p]They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
[p]The why is plain as way to parish church:
[p]He that a fool doth very wisely hit
[p]Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
[p]Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,
[p]The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
[p]Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.
[p]Invest me in my motley; give me leave
[p]To speak my mind, and I will through and through
[p]Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,
[p]If they will patiently receive my medicine.
"
"Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
"
"What, for a counter, would I do but good?
"
"Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
[p]For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
[p]As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
[p]And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
[p]That thou with license of free foot hast caught
[p]Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
"
"Why, who cries out on pride
[p]That can therein tax any private party?
[p]Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
[p]Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
[p]What woman in the city do I name
[p]When that I say the city-woman bears
[p]The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
[p]Who can come in and say that I mean her,
[p]When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
[p]Or what is he of basest function
[p]That says his bravery is not on my cost,
[p]Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
[p]His folly to the mettle of my speech?
[p]There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
[p]My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
[p]Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
[p]Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
[p]Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
"
"Forbear, and eat no more.
"
"Why, I have eat none yet.
"
"Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
"
"Of what kind should this cock come of?
"
"Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
[p]Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
[p]That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
"
"You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
[p]Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
[p]Of smooth civility; yet am I inland bred,
[p]And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;
[p]He dies that touches any of this fruit
[p]Till I and my affairs are answered.
"
"An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
"
"What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
[p]More than your force move us to gentleness.
"
"I almost die for food, and let me have it.
"
"Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
"
"Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
[p]I thought that all things had been savage here,
[p]And therefore put I on the countenance
[p]Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
[p]That in this desert inaccessible,
[p]Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
[p]Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
[p]If ever you have look'd on better days,
[p]If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
[p]If ever sat at any good man's feast,
[p]If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
[p]And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
[p]Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;
[p]In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
"
"True is it that we have seen better days,
[p]And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
[p]And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes
[p]Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;
[p]And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
[p]And take upon command what help we have
[p]That to your wanting may be minist'red.
"
"Then but forbear your food a little while,
[p]Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
[p]And give it food. There is an old poor man
[p]Who after me hath many a weary step
[p]Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,
[p]Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
[p]I will not touch a bit.
"
"Go find him out.
[p]And we will nothing waste till you return.
"
"I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!  Exit
"
"Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
[p]This wide and universal theatre
[p]Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
[p]Wherein we play in.
"
"All the world's a stage,
[p]And all the men and women merely players;
[p]They have their exits and their entrances;
[p]And one man in his time plays many parts,
[p]His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
[p]Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
[p]Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
[p]And shining morning face, creeping like snail
[p]Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
[p]Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
[p]Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
[p]Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
[p]Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
[p]Seeking the bubble reputation
[p]Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
[p]In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
[p]With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
[p]Full of wise saws and modern instances;
[p]And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
[p]Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
[p]With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
[p]His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
[p]For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
[p]Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
[p]And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
[p]That ends this strange eventful history,
[p]Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
[p]Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
"
"Welcome. Set down your venerable burden,
[p]And let him feed.
"
"I thank you most for him.
"
"So had you need;
[p]I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
"
"Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you
[p]As yet to question you about your fortunes.
[p]Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
[p]                     SONG
[p]        Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
[p]        Thou art not so unkind
[p]          As man's ingratitude;
[p]        Thy tooth is not so keen,
[p]        Because thou art not seen,
[p]          Although thy breath be rude.
[p]Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly.
[p]Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
[p]        Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
[p]          This life is most jolly.
[p]        Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
[p]        That dost not bite so nigh
[p]          As benefits forgot;
[p]        Though thou the waters warp,
[p]        Thy sting is not so sharp
[p]          As friend rememb'red not.
[p]Heigh-ho! sing, &c.

"If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
[p]As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,

[p]Most truly limn'd and living in your face,

[p]That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune,
[p]Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
[p]Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
[p]Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
[p]And let me all your fortunes understand.         Exeunt
"
"Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.
[p]But were I not the better part made mercy,
[p]I should not seek an absent argument
[p]Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
[p]Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is;
[p]Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
[p]Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
[p]To seek a living in our territory.
[p]Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
[p]Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
[p]Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
[p]Of what we think against thee.
"
"O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
[p]I never lov'd my brother in my life.
"
"More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
[p]And let my officers of such a nature
[p]Make an extent upon his house and lands.
[p]Do this expediently, and turn him going.         Exeunt
"
"Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
[p]And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
[p]With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
[p]Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
[p]O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
[p]And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
[p]That every eye which in this forest looks
[p]Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.

"
"And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
"
"Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
[p]life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought.
[p]In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in
[p]respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in
[p]respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect
[p]it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life,
[p]look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty
[p]in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in
[p]thee, shepherd?
"
"No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
[p]ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is
[p]without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,
[p]and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a
[p]great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath
[p]learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,
[p]or comes of a very dull kindred.
"
"Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
[p]court, shepherd?
"
"No, truly.
"
"Then thou art damn'd.
"
"Nay, I hope.
"
"Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
[p]one side.
"
"For not being at court? Your reason.
"
"Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
[p]manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must
[p]be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art
[p]in a parlous state, shepherd.
"
"Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the
[p]court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
[p]country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not
[p]at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be
[p]uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
"
"Instance, briefly; come, instance.
"
"Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
[p]know, are greasy.
"
"Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
[p]grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow,
[p]shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
"
"Besides, our hands are hard.
"
"Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A
[p]more sounder instance; come.
"
"And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
[p]sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are
[p]perfum'd with civet.
"
"Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
[p]piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is
[p]of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend
[p]the instance, shepherd.
"
"You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
"
"Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God
[p]make incision in thee! thou art raw.
"
"Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I
[p]wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
[p]men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is
[p]to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
"
"That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes
[p]and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the
[p]copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray
[p]a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
[p]out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn'd for this,
[p]the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how
[p]thou shouldst scape.

[p]         Runs his erring pilgrimage,
[p]       That the streching of a span
[p]         Buckles in his sum of age;
[p]       Some, of violated vows
[p]         'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
[p]       But upon the fairest boughs,
[p]         Or at every sentence end,
[p]       Will I Rosalinda write,
[p]         Teaching all that read to know
[p]       The quintessence of every sprite
[p]         Heaven would in little show.
[p]       Therefore heaven Nature charg'd
[p]         That one body should be fill'd
[p]       With all graces wide-enlarg'd.
[p]         Nature presently distill'd
[p]       Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
[p]         Cleopatra's majesty,
[p]       Atalanta's better part,
[p]         Sad Lucretia's modesty.
[p]       Thus Rosalinde of many parts
[p]         By heavenly synod was devis'd,
[p]       Of many faces, eyes, and hearts,
[p]         To have the touches dearest priz'd.
[p]       Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
[p]       And I to live and die her slave.'

"O most gentle Jupiter! What tedious homily of love have
[p]you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have
[p]patience, good people.'
"
"How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with
[p]him, sirrah.
"
"Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
[p]though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
"
"Didst thou hear these verses?
"
"O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
[p]had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
"
"That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
"
"Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
[p]without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
"
"But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
[p]hang'd and carved upon these trees?
"
"I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
[p]came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so
[p]berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat, which I
[p]can hardly remember.
"
"Trow you who hath done this?
"
"Is it a man?
"
"And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
[p]Change you colour?
"
"I prithee, who?
"
"O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
[p]mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter.
"
"Nay, but who is it?
"
"Is it possible?
"
"Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
[p]me who it is.
"
"O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
[p]again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!
"
"Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
[p]caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my
[p]disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.
[p]I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would
[p]thou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man
[p]out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle-
[p]either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork
[p]out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.
"
"So you may put a man in your belly.
"
"Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
[p]Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?
"
"Nay, he hath but a little beard.
"
"Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let
[p]me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the
[p]knowledge of his chin.
"
"It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels
[p]and your heart both in an instant.
"
"Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true
[p]maid.
"
"I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
"
"Orlando?
"
"Orlando.
"
"Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
[p]What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?
[p]Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where
[p]remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him
[p]again? Answer me in one word.
"
"You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too
[p]great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these
[p]particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.
"
"But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's
[p]apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
"
"It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
[p]propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and
[p]relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a
[p]dropp'd acorn.
"
"It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth
[p]such fruit.
"
"Give me audience, good madam.
"
"Proceed.
"
"There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
"
"Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes
[p]the ground.
"
"Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
[p]unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.
"
"O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
"
"I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out
[p]of tune.
"
"Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.
[p]Sweet, say on.
"
"You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
"
"'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
"
"I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as
[p]lief have been myself alone.
"
"And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
[p]for your society.
"
"God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
"
"I do desire we may be better strangers.
"
"I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
[p]their barks.
"
"I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
[p]ill-favouredly.
"
"Rosalind is your love's name?
"
"Yes, just.
"
"I do not like her name.
"
"There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
[p]christen'd.
"
"What stature is she of?
"
"Just as high as my heart.
"
"You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
[p]acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings?
"
"Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
[p]you have studied your questions.
"
"You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
[p]heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against
[p]our mistress the world, and all our misery.
"
"I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
[p]whom I know most faults.
"
"The worst fault you have is to be in love.
"
"'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
[p]weary of you.
"
"By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
"
"He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
[p]him.
"
"There I shall see mine own figure.
"
"Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
"
"I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
"
"I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur
[p]Melancholy.
"
"[Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
[p]and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear,
[p]forester?
"
"Very well; what would you?
"
"I pray you, what is't o'clock?
"
"You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
[p]the forest.
"
"Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
[p]every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
[p]of Time as well as a clock.
"
"And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
[p]proper?
"
"By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
[p]divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time
[p]trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still
[p]withal.
"
"I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
"
"Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
[p]contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the
[p]interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems
[p]the length of seven year.
"
"Who ambles Time withal?
"
"With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
[p]not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,
[p]and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one
[p]lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other
[p]knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles
[p]withal.
"
"Who doth he gallop withal?
"
"With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
[p]as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
"
"Who stays it still withal?
"
"With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
[p]and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.
"
"Where dwell you, pretty youth?
"
"With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
[p]the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
"
"Are you native of this place?
"
"As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
"
"Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
[p]so removed a dwelling.
"
"I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
[p]uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland
[p]man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.
[p]I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I
[p]am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he
[p]hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.
"
"Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
[p]to the charge of women?
"
"There were none principal; they were all like one another
[p]as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his
[p]fellow-fault came to match it.
"
"I prithee recount some of them.
"
"No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
[p]sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
[p]plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon
[p]hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the
[p]name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give
[p]him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
[p]upon him.
"
"I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
[p]remedy.
"
"There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
[p]how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you
[p]are not prisoner.
"
"What were his marks?
"
"A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
[p]which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;
[p]a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,
[p]for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.
[p]Then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your
[p]sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you
[p]demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you
[p]are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself
[p]than seeming the lover of any other.
"
"Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
"
"Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
[p]believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess
[p]she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give
[p]the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that
[p]hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
"
"I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
[p]am that he, that unfortunate he.
"
"But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
"
"Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
"
"Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
[p]well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
[p]they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
[p]ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing
[p]it by counsel.
"
"Did you ever cure any so?
"
"Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
[p]love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which
[p]time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,
[p]changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,
[p]shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every
[p]passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and
[p]women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like
[p]him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now
[p]weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his
[p]mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to
[p]forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
[p]merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take
[p]upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,
[p]that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
"
"I would not be cured, youth.
"
"I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
[p]come every day to my cote and woo me.
"
"Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
"
"Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
[p]you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?
"
"With all my heart, good youth.
"
"Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you
[p]go?                                                   Exeunt
"
"Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
[p]Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature
[p]content you?
"
"Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
"
"I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
[p]capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
"
"[Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
[p]thatch'd house!
"
"When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
[p]good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it
[p]strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.
[p]Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
"
"I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
[p]word? Is it a true thing?
"
"No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
[p]and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may
[p]be said as lovers they do feign.
"
"Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
"
"I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
[p]now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst
[p]feign.
"
"Would you not have me honest?
"
"No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
[p]coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
"
"[Aside] A material fool!
"
"Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
[p]honest.
"
"Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
[p]to put good meat into an unclean dish.
"
"I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
"
"Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
[p]sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will
[p]marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,
[p]the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in
[p]this place of the forest, and to couple us.
"
"[Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
"
"Well, the gods give us joy!
"
"Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
[p]in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no
[p]assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are
[p]odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end
[p]of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end
[p]of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
[p]own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
[p]deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore
[p]blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so
[p]is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
[p]brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
[p]skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes
[p]Sir Oliver.
[p][Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT]
[p]Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here
[p]under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
"
"Is there none here to give the woman?
"
"I will not take her on gift of any man.
"
"Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
"
"[Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
"
"Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
[p]You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am
[p]very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be
[p]cover'd.
"
"Will you be married, motley?
"
"As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
[p]the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons
[p]bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
"
"And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
[p]under a bush, like a beggar? Get you to church and have a good
[p]priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but
[p]join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
[p]prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.
"
"[Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
[p]married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me
[p]well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me
[p]hereafter to leave my wife.
"
"Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
"
"Come, sweet Audrey;
[p]We must be married or we must live in bawdry.
[p]Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not-
[p]           O sweet Oliver,
[p]           O brave Oliver,
[p]       Leave me not behind thee.
[p]But-
[p]             Wind away,
[p]           Begone, I say,
[p]       I will not to wedding with thee.
[p]                       Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY
"
"'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
[p]shall flout me out of my calling.                  Exit
"
"Never talk to me; I will weep.
"
"Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
[p]do not become a man.
"
"But have I not cause to weep?
"
"As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
"
"His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
"
"Something browner than Judas's.
[p]Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.
"
"I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
"
"An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
"
"And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
[p]holy bread.
"
"He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
[p]winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of
[p]chastity is in them.
"
"But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
[p]comes not?
"
"Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
"
"Do you think so?
"
"Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
[p]for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered
[p]goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
"
"Not true in love?
"
"Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
"
"You have heard him swear downright he was.
"
"'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
[p]stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer
[p]of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke,
[p]your father.
"
"I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
[p]He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as
[p]he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when
[p]there is such a man as Orlando?
"
"O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave
[p]words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite
[p]traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that
[p]spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
[p]goose. But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who
[p]comes here?
"
"Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
[p]After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
[p]Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
[p]Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
[p]That was his mistress.
"
"Well, and what of him?
"
"If you will see a pageant truly play'd
[p]Between the pale complexion of true love
[p]And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
[p]Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,
[p]If you will mark it.
"
"O, come, let us remove!
[p]The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
[p]Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
[p]I'll prove a busy actor in their play.           Exeunt
"
"Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
[p]Say that you love me not; but say not so
[p]In bitterness. The common executioner,
[p]Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
[p]Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
[p]But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
[p]Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
"
"I would not be thy executioner;
[p]I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
[p]Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.
[p]'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
[p]That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
[p]Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
[p]Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
[p]Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
[p]And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
[p]Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
[p]Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
[p]Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
[p]Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
[p]Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
[p]Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,
[p]The cicatrice and capable impressure
[p]Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
[p]Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
[p]Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes
[p]That can do hurt.
"
"O dear Phebe,
[p]If ever- as that ever may be near-
[p]You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
[p]Then shall you know the wounds invisible
[p]That love's keen arrows make.
"
"But till that time
[p]Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,
[p]Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
[p]As till that time I shall not pity thee.
"
"[Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
[p]  mother,
[p]That you insult, exult, and all at once,
[p]Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty-
[p]As, by my faith, I see no more in you
[p]Than without candle may go dark to bed-
[p]Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
[p]Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
[p]I see no more in you than in the ordinary
[p]Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
[p]I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
[p]No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;
[p]'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
[p]Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
[p]That can entame my spirits to your worship.
[p]You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
[p]Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
[p]You are a thousand times a properer man
[p]Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you
[p]That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.
[p]'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
[p]And out of you she sees herself more proper
[p]Than any of her lineaments can show her.
[p]But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,
[p]And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;
[p]For I must tell you friendly in your ear:
[p]Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
[p]Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;
[p]Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
[p]So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
"
"Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
[p]I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
"
"He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
[p]in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee
[p]with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look
[p]you so upon me?
"
"For no ill will I bear you.
"
"I pray you do not fall in love with me,
[p]For I am falser than vows made in wine;
[p]Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
[p]'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
[p]Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
[p]Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
[p]And be not proud; though all the world could see,
[p]None could be so abus'd in sight as he.
[p]Come, to our flock.   Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN
"
"Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
[p]'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'
"
"Sweet Phebe.
"
"Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
"
"Sweet Phebe, pity me.
"
"Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
"
"Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
[p]If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
[p]By giving love, your sorrow and my grief
[p]Were both extermin'd.
"
"Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
"
"I would have you.
"
"Why, that were covetousness.
[p]Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
[p]And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
[p]But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
[p]Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
[p]I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.
[p]But do not look for further recompense
[p]Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
"
"So holy and so perfect is my love,
[p]And I in such a poverty of grace,
[p]That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
[p]To glean the broken ears after the man
[p]That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then
[p]A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
"
"Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
"
"Not very well; but I have met him oft;
[p]And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
[p]That the old carlot once was master of.
"
"Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
[p]'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.
[p]But what care I for words? Yet words do well
[p]When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
[p]It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;
[p]But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.
[p]He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him
[p]Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
[p]Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
[p]He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;
[p]His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
[p]There was a pretty redness in his lip,
[p]A little riper and more lusty red
[p]Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
[p]Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
[p]There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
[p]In parcels as I did, would have gone near
[p]To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
[p]I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
[p]I have more cause to hate him than to love him;
[p]For what had he to do to chide at me?
[p]He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
[p]And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
[p]I marvel why I answer'd not again;
[p]But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.
[p]I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
[p]And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
"
"Phebe, with all my heart.
"
"I'll write it straight;
[p]The matter's in my head and in my heart;
[p]I will be bitter with him and passing short.
[p]Go with me, Silvius.                             Exeunt
"
"I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
[p]thee.
"
"They say you are a melancholy fellow.
"
"I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
"
"Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
[p]fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
[p]drunkards.
"
"Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
"
"Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
"
"I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
[p]emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the
[p]courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is
[p]ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's,
[p]which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a
[p]melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
[p]from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my
[p]travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous
[p]sadness.
"
"A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
[p]sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then
[p]to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
[p]poor hands.
"
"Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
"
"And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
[p]fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to
[p]travel for it too.
"
"Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
"
"Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
"
"Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
[p]strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be
[p]out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
[p]you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
[p]swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where
[p]have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
[p]another trick, never come in my sight more.
"
"My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
"
"Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
[p]minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the
[p]thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said
[p]of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll
[p]warrant him heart-whole.
"
"Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
"
"Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
[p]as lief be woo'd of a snail.
"
"Of a snail!
"
"Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
[p]his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make
[p]a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
"
"What's that?
"
"Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
[p]your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents
[p]the slander of his wife.
"
"Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
"
"And I am your Rosalind.
"
"It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
[p]better leer than you.
"
"Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
[p]and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I
[p]were your very very Rosalind?
"
"I would kiss before I spoke.
"
"Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
[p]gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
[p]Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
[p]lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to
[p]kiss.
"
"How if the kiss be denied?
"
"Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
[p]matter.
"
"Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
"
"Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
[p]should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
"
"What, of my suit?
"
"Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
[p]Am not I your Rosalind?
"
"I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
[p]of her.
"
"Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
"
"Then, in mine own person, I die.
"
"No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
[p]thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man
[p]died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had
[p]his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
[p]could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.
[p]Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had
[p]turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,
[p]good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,
[p]being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish
[p]chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these
[p]are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
[p]eaten them, but not for love.
"
"I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
[p]protest, her frown might kill me.
"
"By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
[p]will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me
[p]what you will, I will grant it.
"
"Then love me, Rosalind.
"
"Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
"
"And wilt thou have me?
"
"Ay, and twenty such.
"
"What sayest thou?
"
"Are you not good?
"
"I hope so.
"
"Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
[p]sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,
[p]Orlando. What do you say, sister?
"
"Pray thee, marry us.
"
"I cannot say the words.
"
"You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
"
"Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
"
"I will.
"
"Ay, but when?
"
"Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
"
"Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
"
"I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
"
"I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
[p]Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;
[p]and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.
"
"So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
"
"Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
[p]possess'd her.
"
"For ever and a day.
"
"Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
[p]April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when
[p]they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will
[p]be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
[p]more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than
[p]an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for
[p]nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you
[p]are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when
[p]thou are inclin'd to sleep.
"
"But will my Rosalind do so?
"
"By my life, she will do as I do.
"
"O, but she is wise.
"
"Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
[p]the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out
[p]at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop
[p]that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
"
"A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
[p]whither wilt?'
"
"Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your
[p]wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
"
"And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
"
"Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
[p]take her without her answer, unless you take her without her
[p]tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's
[p]occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will
[p]breed it like a fool!
"
"For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
"
"Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
"
"I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
[p]with thee again.
"
"Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
[p]prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That
[p]flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and
[p]so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
"
"Ay, sweet Rosalind.
"
"By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
[p]by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot
[p]of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will
[p]think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow
[p]lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may
[p]be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore
[p]beware my censure, and keep your promise.
"
"With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
[p]Rosalind; so, adieu.
"
"Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
[p]offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.        Exit ORLANDO
"
"You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
[p]have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the
[p]world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
"
"O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst
[p]know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;
[p]my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
"
"Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
[p]in, it runs out.
"
"No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
[p]thought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind
[p]rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are
[p]out- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,
[p]Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a
[p]shadow, and sigh till he come.
"
"And I'll sleep.                             Exeunt
"
"Which is he that killed the deer?
"
"Sir, it was I.
"
"Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
[p]it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a
[p]branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
"
"Yes, sir.
"
"Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
[p]enough.
[p]                SONG.
[p]  What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
[p]  His leather skin and horns to wear.
[p]                          [The rest shall hear this burden:]
[p]       Then sing him home.
[p]  Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
[p]  It was a crest ere thou wast born.
[p]       Thy father's father wore it;
[p]       And thy father bore it.
[p]  The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,
[p]  Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.              Exeunt
"
"How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
[p]And here much Orlando!
"
"I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
[p]ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. Look, who
[p]comes here.
"
"My errand is to you, fair youth;
[p]My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
[p]I know not the contents; but, as I guess
[p]By the stern brow and waspish action
[p]Which she did use as she was writing of it,
[p]It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,
[p]I am but as a guiltless messenger.
"
"Patience herself would startle at this letter,
[p]And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
[p]She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
[p]She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
[p]Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!
[p]Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
[p]Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
[p]This is a letter of your own device.
"
"No, I protest, I know not the contents;
[p]Phebe did write it.
"
"Come, come, you are a fool,
[p]And turn'd into the extremity of love.
[p]I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,
[p]A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
[p]That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;
[p]She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.
[p]I say she never did invent this letter:
[p]This is a man's invention, and his hand.
"
"Sure, it is hers.
"
"Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
[p]A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
[p]Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
[p]Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
[p]Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
[p]Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
"
"So please you, for I never heard it yet;
[p]Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
"
"She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.                                                 [Reads]
[p]        'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
[p]        That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'
[p]Can a woman rail thus?
"
"Call you this railing?
"
"'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
[p]         Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'
[p]Did you ever hear such railing?
[p]        'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
[p]        That could do no vengeance to me.'
[p]Meaning me a beast.
[p]        'If the scorn of your bright eyne
[p]        Have power to raise such love in mine,
[p]        Alack, in me what strange effect
[p]        Would they work in mild aspect!
[p]        Whiles you chid me, I did love;
[p]        How then might your prayers move!
[p]        He that brings this love to the
[p]        Little knows this love in me;
[p]        And by him seal up thy mind,
[p]        Whether that thy youth and kind
[p]        Will the faithful offer take
[p]        Of me and all that I can make;
[p]        Or else by him my love deny,
[p]        And then I'll study how to die.'
"
"Call you this chiding?
"
"Alas, poor shepherd!
"
"Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
[p]such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false
[p]strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
[p]for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
[p]that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
[p]I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
[p]true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.
"
"Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
[p]Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
[p]A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
"
"West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
[p]The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
[p]Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
[p]But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
[p]There's none within.
"
"If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
[p]Then should I know you by description-
[p]Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,
[p]Of female favour, and bestows himself
[p]Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
[p]And browner than her brother.' Are not you
[p]The owner of the house I did inquire for?
"
"It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
"
"Orlando doth commend him to you both;
[p]And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
[p]He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
"
"I am. What must we understand by this?
"
"Some of my shame; if you will know of me
[p]What man I am, and how, and why, and where,
[p]This handkercher was stain'd.
"
"I pray you, tell it.
"
"When last the young Orlando parted from you,
[p]He left a promise to return again
[p]Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,
[p]Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
[p]Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
[p]And mark what object did present itself.
[p]Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
[p]And high top bald with dry antiquity,
[p]A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
[p]Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
[p]A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
[p]Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
[p]The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
[p]Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
[p]And with indented glides did slip away
[p]Into a bush; under which bush's shade
[p]A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
[p]Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
[p]When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
[p]The royal disposition of that beast
[p]To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
[p]This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
[p]And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
"
"O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
[p]And he did render him the most unnatural
[p]That liv'd amongst men.
"
"And well he might so do,
[p]For well I know he was unnatural.
"
"But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
[p]Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
"
"Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
[p]But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
[p]And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
[p]Made him give battle to the lioness,
[p]Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
[p]From miserable slumber I awak'd.
"
"Are you his brother?
"
"Was't you he rescu'd?
"
"Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
"
"'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
[p]To tell you what I was, since my conversion
[p]So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
"
"But for the bloody napkin?
"
"By and by.
[p]When from the first to last, betwixt us two,
[p]Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,
[p]As how I came into that desert place-
[p]In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
[p]Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
[p]Committing me unto my brother's love;
[p]Who led me instantly unto his cave,
[p]There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
[p]The lioness had torn some flesh away,
[p]Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
[p]And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
[p]Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,
[p]And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
[p]He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
[p]To tell this story, that you might excuse
[p]His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
[p]Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
[p]That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
"
"Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
"
"Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
"
"There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
"
"Look, he recovers.
"
"I would I were at home.
"
"We'll lead you thither.
[p]I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
"
"Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
[p]You lack a man's heart.
"
"I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
[p]this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how
[p]well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
"
"This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
[p]your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
"
"Counterfeit, I assure you.
"
"Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
"
"So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
[p]right.
"
"Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
[p]Good sir, go with us.
"
"That will I, for I must bear answer back
[p]How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
"
"I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
[p]counterfeiting to him. Will you go? Exeunt
"
"We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
"
"Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
[p]gentleman's saying.
"
"A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
[p]But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to
[p]you.
"
"Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the
[p]world; here comes the man you mean.
"
"It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth,
[p]we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be
[p]flouting; we cannot hold.
"
"Good ev'n, Audrey.
"
"God ye good ev'n, William.
"
"And good ev'n to you, sir.
"
"Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
[p]head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend?
"
"Five and twenty, sir.
"
"A ripe age. Is thy name William?
"
"William, sir.
"
"A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
"
"Ay, sir, I thank God.
"
"'Thank God.' A good answer.
[p]Art rich?
"
"Faith, sir, so so.
"
"'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
[p]yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
"
"Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
"
"Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The
[p]fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be
[p]a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a
[p]grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning
[p]thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do
[p]love this maid?
"
"I do, sir.
"
"Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
"
"No, sir.
"
"Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a
[p]figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a
[p]glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your
[p]writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I
[p]am he.
"
"Which he, sir?
"
"He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
[p]clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which
[p]in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is
[p]woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,
[p]clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;
[p]or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into
[p]death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,
[p]or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;
[p]will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and
[p]fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
"
"Do, good William.
"
"God rest you merry, sir. Exit
"
"Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away.
"
"Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.
"
"Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should
[p]like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo?
[p]and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy
[p]her?
"
"Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty
[p]of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden
[p]consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she
[p]loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It
[p]shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the revenue
[p]that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live
[p]and die a shepherd.
"
"You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.
[p]Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers. Go
[p]you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.
"
"God save you, brother.
"
"And you, fair sister. Exit
"
"O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
[p]thy heart in a scarf!
"
"It is my arm.
"
"I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
[p]lion.
"
"Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
"
"Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
[p]when he show'd me your handkercher?
"
"Ay, and greater wonders than that.
"
"O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
[p]any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's
[p]thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother
[p]and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but
[p]they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but
[p]they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but
[p]they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair
[p]of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else
[p]be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of
[p]love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.
"
"They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
[p]to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into
[p]happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I
[p]to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I
[p]shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
"
"Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
[p]Rosalind?
"
"I can live no longer by thinking.
"
"I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know
[p]of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are
[p]a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should
[p]bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you
[p]are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some
[p]little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and
[p]not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do
[p]strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd
[p]with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.
[p]If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries
[p]it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I
[p]know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not
[p]impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set
[p]her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any
[p]danger.
"
"Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
"
"By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I
[p]am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your
[p]friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to
[p]Rosalind, if you will.
[p][Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]
[p]Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.
"
"Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
[p]To show the letter that I writ to you.
"
"I care not if I have. It is my study
[p]To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
[p]You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;
[p]Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
"
"Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
"
"It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
[p]And so am I for Phebe.
"
"And I for Ganymede.
"
"And I for Rosalind.
"
"And I for no woman.
"
"It is to be all made of faith and service;
[p]And so am I for Phebe.
"
"And I for Ganymede.
"
"And I for Rosalind.
"
"And I for no woman.
"
"It is to be all made of fantasy,
[p]All made of passion, and all made of wishes;
[p]All adoration, duty, and observance,
[p]All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,
[p]All purity, all trial, all obedience;
[p]And so am I for Phebe.
"
"And so am I for Ganymede.
"
"And so am I for Rosalind.
"
"And so am I for no woman.
"
"If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
"
"If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
"
"If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
"
"Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
"
"To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
"
"Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish
[p]wolves against the moon. [To SILVIUS] I will help you if I can.
[p][To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all
[p]together. [ To PHEBE ] I will marry you if ever I marry woman,
[p]and I'll be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] I will satisfy you if
[p]ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. [To
[p]Silvius] I will content you if what pleases you contents you, and
[p]you shall be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] As you love
[p]Rosalind, meet. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I
[p]love no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you
[p]commands.
"
"I'll not fail, if I live.
"
"Nor I.
"
"Nor I. Exeunt
"
"To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will we
[p]be married.
"
"I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no
[p]dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come
[p]two of the banish'd Duke's pages.
"
"Well met, honest gentleman.
"
"By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.
"
"We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
"
"Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or
[p]spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues
[p]to a bad voice?
"
"I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies
[p]on a horse.
[p] SONG.
[p] It was a lover and his lass,
[p] With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
[p] That o'er the green corn-field did pass
[p] In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
[p] When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
[p] Sweet lovers love the spring.
[p] Between the acres of the rye,
[p] With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
[p] These pretty country folks would lie,
[p] In the spring time, &c.
[p] This carol they began that hour,
[p] With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
[p] How that a life was but a flower,
[p] In the spring time, &c.
[p] And therefore take the present time,
[p] With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
[p] For love is crowned with the prime,
[p] In the spring time, &c.
"
"Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
[p]matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
"
"You are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our
[p]time.
"
"By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such
[p]a foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come,
[p]Audrey. Exeunt
"
"Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
[p]Can do all this that he hath promised?
"
"I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
[p]As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
"
"Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
[p]You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
[p]You will bestow her on Orlando here?
"
"That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
"
"And you say you will have her when I bring her?
"
"That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
"
"You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
"
"That will I, should I die the hour after.
"
"But if you do refuse to marry me,
[p]You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
"
"So is the bargain.
"
"You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
"
"Though to have her and death were both one thing.
"
"I have promis'd to make all this matter even.
[p]Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;
[p]You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;
[p]Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
[p]Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;
[p]Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her
[p]If she refuse me; and from hence I go,
[p]To make these doubts all even.
"
"I do remember in this shepherd boy
[p]Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
"
"My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
[p]Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
[p]But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
[p]And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
[p]Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
[p]Whom he reports to be a great magician,
[p]Obscured in the circle of this forest.
"
"There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are
[p]coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which
[p]in all tongues are call'd fools.
"
"Salutation and greeting to you all!
"
"Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded
[p]gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a
[p] courtier, he swears.
"
"If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
[p]I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
[p]politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone
[p]three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought
[p]one.
"
"And how was that ta'en up?
"
"Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
[p]seventh cause.
"
"How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
"
"I like him very well.
"
"God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in
[p]here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear
[p]and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A
[p]poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a
[p]poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich
[p]honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl
[p]in your foul oyster.
"
"By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
"
"According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
[p]diseases.
"
"But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
[p]the seventh cause?
"
"Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
[p]seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain
[p]courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not
[p]cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort
[p]Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would
[p]send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip
[p]Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.
[p]This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,
[p]he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof
[p]Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This
[p]is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie
[p]Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
"
"And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
"
"I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor
[p]he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords
[p]and parted.
"
"Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
"
"O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
[p]books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,
[p]the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the
[p]Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
[p]Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;
[p]the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie
[p]Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven
[p]justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were
[p]met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you
[p]said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore
[p]brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.
"
"Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
[p]He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.
"
"He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the
[p]presentation of that he shoots his wit.

[p] Enter JAQUES DE BOYS
"
"Let me have audience for a word or two.
[p]I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
[p]That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
[p]Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
[p]Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
[p]Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
[p]In his own conduct, purposely to take
[p]His brother here, and put him to the sword;
[p]And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
[p]Where, meeting with an old religious man,
[p]After some question with him, was converted
[p]Both from his enterprise and from the world;
[p]His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
[p]And all their lands restor'd to them again
[p]That were with him exil'd. This to be true
[p]I do engage my life.
"
"Welcome, young man.
[p]Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
[p]To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,
[p]A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
[p]First, in this forest let us do those ends
[p]That here were well begun and well begot;
[p]And after, every of this happy number,
[p]That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,
[p]Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
[p]According to the measure of their states.
[p]Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
[p]And fall into our rustic revelry.
[p]Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,
[p]With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.
"
"Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
[p]The Duke hath put on a religious life,
[p]And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
"
"He hath.
"
"To him will I. Out of these convertites
[p]There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
[p][To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;
[p]Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
[p][To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit;
[p][To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies
[p][To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;
[p][To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
[p]Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;
[p]I am for other than for dancing measures.
"
"Stay, Jaques, stay.
"
"To see no pastime I. What you would have
[p]I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave. Exit

"Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites,
[p]As we do trust they'll end, in true delights. [A dance] Exeunt EPILOGUE
"
"It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but
[p]it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it
[p]be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play
[p]needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and
[p]good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a
[p]case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot
[p]insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
[p]furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My
[p]way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge
[p]you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of
[p]this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love
[p]you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you
[p]hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.
[p]If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that
[p]pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied
[p]not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,
[p]or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,
[p]bid me farewell.

"Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
[p]And by the doom of death end woes and all.
"
"Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
[p]I am not partial to infringe our laws:
[p]The enmity and discord which of late
[p]Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
[p]To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
[p]Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
[p]Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
[p]Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
[p]For, since the mortal and intestine jars
[p]'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
[p]It hath in solemn synods been decreed
[p]Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
[p]To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
[p]If any born at Ephesus be seen
[p]At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
[p]Again: if any Syracusian born
[p]Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
[p]His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
[p]Unless a thousand marks be levied,
[p]To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
[p]Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
[p]Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
[p]Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
"
"Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
[p]My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
"
"Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
[p]Why thou departed'st from thy native home
[p]And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
"
"A heavier task could not have been imposed
[p]Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
[p]Yet, that the world may witness that my end
[p]Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
[p]I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
[p]In Syracusa was I born, and wed
[p]Unto a woman, happy but for me,
[p]And by me, had not our hap been bad.
[p]With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
[p]By prosperous voyages I often made
[p]To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
[p]And the great care of goods at random left
[p]Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
[p]From whom my absence was not six months old
[p]Before herself, almost at fainting under
[p]The pleasing punishment that women bear,
[p]Had made provision for her following me
[p]And soon and safe arrived where I was.
[p]There had she not been long, but she became
[p]A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
[p]And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
[p]As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
[p]That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
[p]A meaner woman was delivered
[p]Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
[p]Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
[p]I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
[p]My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
[p]Made daily motions for our home return:
[p]Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
[p]We came aboard.
[p]A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
[p]Before the always wind-obeying deep
[p]Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
[p]But longer did we not retain much hope;
[p]For what obscured light the heavens did grant
[p]Did but convey unto our fearful minds
[p]A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
[p]Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
[p]Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
[p]Weeping before for what she saw must come,
[p]And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
[p]That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
[p]Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
[p]And this it was, for other means was none:
[p]The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
[p]And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
[p]My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
[p]Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
[p]Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
[p]To him one of the other twins was bound,
[p]Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
[p]The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
[p]Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
[p]Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
[p]And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
[p]Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
[p]At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
[p]Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
[p]And by the benefit of his wished light,
[p]The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
[p]Two ships from far making amain to us,
[p]Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
[p]But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
[p]Gather the sequel by that went before.
"
"Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
[p]For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
"
"O, had the gods done so, I had not now
[p]Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
[p]For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
[p]We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
[p]Which being violently borne upon,
[p]Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
[p]So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
[p]Fortune had left to both of us alike
[p]What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
[p]Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
[p]With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
[p]Was carried with more speed before the wind;
[p]And in our sight they three were taken up
[p]By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
[p]At length, another ship had seized on us;
[p]And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
[p]Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
[p]And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
[p]Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
[p]And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
[p]Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
[p]That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
[p]To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
"
"And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
[p]Do me the favour to dilate at full
[p]What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
"
"My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
[p]At eighteen years became inquisitive
[p]After his brother: and importuned me
[p]That his attendant--so his case was like,
[p]Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
[p]Might bear him company in the quest of him:
[p]Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
[p]I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
[p]Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
[p]Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
[p]And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
[p]Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
[p]Or that or any place that harbours men.
[p]But here must end the story of my life;
[p]And happy were I in my timely death,
[p]Could all my travels warrant me they live.
"
"Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
[p]To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
[p]Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
[p]Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
[p]Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
[p]My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
[p]But, though thou art adjudged to the death
[p]And passed sentence may not be recall'd
[p]But to our honour's great disparagement,
[p]Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
[p]Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
[p]To seek thy life by beneficial help:
[p]Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
[p]Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
[p]And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
[p]Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
"
"I will, my lord.
"
"Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
[p]But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
"
"Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
[p]Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
[p]This very day a Syracusian merchant
[p]Is apprehended for arrival here;
[p]And not being able to buy out his life
[p]According to the statute of the town,
[p]Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
[p]There is your money that I had to keep.
"
"Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
[p]And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
[p]Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
[p]Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
[p]Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
[p]And then return and sleep within mine inn,
[p]For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
[p]Get thee away.
"
"Many a man would take you at your word,
[p]And go indeed, having so good a mean.
"
"A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
[p]When I am dull with care and melancholy,
[p]Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
[p]What, will you walk with me about the town,
[p]And then go to my inn and dine with me?
"
"I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
[p]Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
[p]I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
[p]Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
[p]And afterward consort you till bed-time:
[p]My present business calls me from you now.
"
"Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
[p]And wander up and down to view the city.
"
"Sir, I commend you to your own content.
"
"He that commends me to mine own content
[p]Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
[p]I to the world am like a drop of water
[p]That in the ocean seeks another drop,
[p]Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
[p]Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
[p]So I, to find a mother and a brother,
[p]In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
[p][Enter DROMIO of Ephesus]
[p]Here comes the almanac of my true date.
[p]What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
"
"Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
[p]The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
[p]The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
[p]My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
[p]She is so hot because the meat is cold;
[p]The meat is cold because you come not home;
[p]You come not home because you have no stomach;
[p]You have no stomach having broke your fast;
[p]But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
[p]Are penitent for your default to-day.
"
"Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
[p]Where have you left the money that I gave you?
"
"O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
[p]To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
[p]The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
"
"I am not in a sportive humour now:
[p]Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
[p]We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
[p]So great a charge from thine own custody?
"
"I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
[p]I from my mistress come to you in post;
[p]If I return, I shall be post indeed,
[p]For she will score your fault upon my pate.
[p]Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
[p]And strike you home without a messenger.
"
"Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
[p]Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
[p]Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
"
"To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
"
"Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
[p]And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
"
"My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
[p]Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
[p]My mistress and her sister stays for you.
"
"In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
[p]Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
[p]That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
[p]Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
"
"I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
[p]Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
[p]But not a thousand marks between you both.
[p]If I should pay your worship those again,
[p]Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
"
"Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?
"
"Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
[p]She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
[p]And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
"
"What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
[p]Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
"
"What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
[p]Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
"
"Upon my life, by some device or other
[p]The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
[p]They say this town is full of cozenage,
[p]As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
[p]Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
[p]Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
[p]Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
[p]And many such-like liberties of sin:
[p]If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
[p]I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
[p]I greatly fear my money is not safe.
"
"Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
[p]That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
[p]Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
"
"Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
[p]And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
[p]Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
[p]A man is master of his liberty:
[p]Time is their master, and, when they see time,
[p]They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
"
"Why should their liberty than ours be more?
"
"Because their business still lies out o' door.
"
"Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
"
"O, know he is the bridle of your will.
"
"There's none but asses will be bridled so.
"
"Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
[p]There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
[p]But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
[p]The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
[p]Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
[p]Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
[p]Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
[p]Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
[p]Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
[p]Are masters to their females, and their lords:
[p]Then let your will attend on their accords.
"
"This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
"
"Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
"
"But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
"
"Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
"
"How if your husband start some other where?
"
"Till he come home again, I would forbear.
"
"Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
[p]They can be meek that have no other cause.
[p]A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
[p]We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
[p]But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
[p]As much or more would we ourselves complain:
[p]So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
[p]With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
[p]But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
[p]This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
"
"Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
[p]Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
"
"Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
"
"Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
[p]can witness.
"
"Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?
"
"Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
[p]Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
"
"Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?
"
"Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
[p]blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
[p]understand them.
"
"But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
[p]hath great care to please his wife.
"
"Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
"
"Horn-mad, thou villain!
"
"I mean not cuckold-mad;
[p]But, sure, he is stark mad.
[p]When I desired him to come home to dinner,
[p]He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
[p]'Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
[p]'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
[p]'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
[p]'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
[p]'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
[p]'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
[p]I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'
"
"Quoth who?
"
"Quoth my master:
[p]'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
[p]So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
[p]I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
[p]For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
"
"Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
"
"Go back again, and be new beaten home?
[p]For God's sake, send some other messenger.
"
"Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
"
"And he will bless that cross with other beating:
[p]Between you I shall have a holy head.
"
"Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.
"
"Am I so round with you as you with me,
[p]That like a football you do spurn me thus?
[p]You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
[p]If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
"
"Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!
"
"His company must do his minions grace,
[p]Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
[p]Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
[p]From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
[p]Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
[p]If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
[p]Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
[p]Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
[p]That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
[p]What ruins are in me that can be found,
[p]By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
[p]Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
[p]A sunny look of his would soon repair
[p]But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
[p]And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
"
"Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!
"
"Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
[p]I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
[p]Or else what lets it but he would be here?
[p]Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
[p]Would that alone, alone he would detain,
[p]So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
[p]I see the jewel best enamelled
[p]Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
[p]That others touch, and often touching will
[p]Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
[p]By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
[p]Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
[p]I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
"
"How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
"
"The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
[p]Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
[p]Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
[p]By computation and mine host's report.
[p]I could not speak with Dromio since at first
[p]I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
[p][Enter DROMIO of Syracuse]
[p]How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
[p]As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
[p]You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
[p]Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
[p]My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
[p]That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
"
"What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
"
"Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
"
"I did not see you since you sent me hence,
[p]Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
"
"Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
[p]And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
[p]For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.
"
"I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
[p]What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
"
"Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
[p]Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
"
"Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
[p]Upon what bargain do you give it me?
"
"Because that I familiarly sometimes
[p]Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
[p]Your sauciness will jest upon my love
[p]And make a common of my serious hours.
[p]When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
[p]But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
[p]If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
[p]And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
[p]Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
"
"Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
[p]had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
[p]long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
[p]it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
[p]But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
"
"Dost thou not know?
"
"Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
"
"Shall I tell you why?
"
"Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
[p]a wherefore.
"
"Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
[p]For urging it the second time to me.
"
"Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
[p]When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
[p]nor reason?
[p]Well, sir, I thank you.
"
"Thank me, sir, for what?
"
"Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
"
"I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
[p]something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
"
"No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
"
"In good time, sir; what's that?
"
"Basting.
"
"Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
"
"If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
"
"Your reason?
"
"Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
[p]dry basting.
"
"Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
[p]time for all things.
"
"I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
"
"By what rule, sir?
"
"Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
[p]pate of father Time himself.
"
"Let's hear it.
"
"There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
[p]grows bald by nature.
"
"May he not do it by fine and recovery?
"
"Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
[p]lost hair of another man.
"
"Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
[p]so plentiful an excrement?
"
"Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
[p]and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
"
"Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
"
"Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
"
"Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
"
"The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
[p]it in a kind of jollity.
"
"For what reason?
"
"For two; and sound ones too.
"
"Nay, not sound, I pray you.
"
"Sure ones, then.
"
"Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
"
"Certain ones then.
"
"Name them.
"
"The one, to save the money that he spends in
[p]trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
[p]drop in his porridge.
"
"You would all this time have proved there is no
[p]time for all things.
"
"Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
[p]lost by nature.
"
"But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
[p]time to recover.
"
"Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
[p]to the world's end will have bald followers.
"
"I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
[p]But, soft! who wafts us yonder?
"
"Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
[p]Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
[p]I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
[p]The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
[p]That never words were music to thine ear,
[p]That never object pleasing in thine eye,
[p]That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
[p]That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
[p]Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
[p]How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
[p]That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
[p]Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
[p]That, undividable, incorporate,
[p]Am better than thy dear self's better part.
[p]Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
[p]For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
[p]A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
[p]And take unmingled that same drop again,
[p]Without addition or diminishing,
[p]As take from me thyself and not me too.
[p]How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
[p]Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
[p]And that this body, consecrate to thee,
[p]By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
[p]Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
[p]And hurl the name of husband in my face
[p]And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
[p]And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
[p]And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
[p]I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
[p]I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
[p]My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
[p]For if we too be one and thou play false,
[p]I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
[p]Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
[p]Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
[p]I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
"
"Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
[p]In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
[p]As strange unto your town as to your talk;
[p]Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
[p]Want wit in all one word to understand.
"
"Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
[p]When were you wont to use my sister thus?
[p]She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
"
"By Dromio?
"
"By me?
"
"By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
[p]That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
[p]Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
"
"Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
[p]What is the course and drift of your compact?
"
"I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
"
"Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
[p]Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
"
"I never spake with her in all my life.
"
"How can she thus then call us by our names,
[p]Unless it be by inspiration.
"
"How ill agrees it with your gravity
[p]To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
[p]Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
[p]Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
[p]But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
[p]Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
[p]Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
[p]Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
[p]Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
[p]If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
[p]Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
[p]Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
[p]Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
"
"To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
[p]What, was I married to her in my dream?
[p]Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
[p]What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
[p]Until I know this sure uncertainty,
[p]I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
"
"Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
"
"O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
[p]This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
[p]We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
[p]If we obey them not, this will ensue,
[p]They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
"
"Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
[p]Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
"
"I am transformed, master, am I not?
"
"I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
"
"Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
"
"Thou hast thine own form.
"
"No, I am an ape.
"
"If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
"
"'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
[p]'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
[p]But I should know her as well as she knows me.
"
"Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
[p]To put the finger in the eye and weep,
[p]Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
[p]Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
[p]Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
[p]And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
[p]Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
[p]Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
[p]Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
"
"Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
[p]Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
[p]Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
[p]I'll say as they say and persever so,
[p]And in this mist at all adventures go.
"
"Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
"
"Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
"
"Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
"
"Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
[p]My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
[p]Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
[p]To see the making of her carcanet,
[p]And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
[p]But here's a villain that would face me down
[p]He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
[p]And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
[p]And that I did deny my wife and house.
[p]Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
"
"Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
[p]That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
[p]If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
[p]Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
"
"I think thou art an ass.
"
"Marry, so it doth appear
[p]By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
[p]I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
[p]You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
"
"You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
[p]May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
"
"I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
[p]welcome dear.
"
"O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
[p]A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.
"
"Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
"
"And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.
"
"Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
"
"Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
[p]But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
[p]Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
[p]But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.
"
"Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!
"
"[Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
[p]idiot, patch!
[p]Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
[p]Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st
[p]for such store,
[p]When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.
"
"What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
[p]the street.
"
"[Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he
[p]catch cold on's feet.
"
"Who talks within there? ho, open the door!
"
"[Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell
[p]me wherefore.
"
"Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.
"
"[Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come again
[p]when you may.
"
"What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?
"
"[Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my name
[p]is Dromio.
"
"O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
[p]The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
[p]If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
[p]Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
[p]name for an ass.
"
"[Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those
[p]at the gate?
"
"Let my master in, Luce.
"
"[Within] Faith, no; he comes too late;
[p]And so tell your master.
"
"O Lord, I must laugh!
[p]Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?
"
"[Within] Have at you with another; that's--When?
[p]can you tell?
"
"[Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast
[p]answered him well.
"
"Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
"
"[Within] I thought to have asked you.
"
"[Within] And you said no.
"
"So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
"
"Thou baggage, let me in.
"
"[Within] Can you tell for whose sake?
"
"Master, knock the door hard.
"
"[Within] Let him knock till it ache.
"
"You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
"
"[Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
"
"[Within] Who is that at the door that keeps all
[p]this noise?
"
"[Within] By my troth, your town is troubled with
[p]unruly boys.
"
"Are you there, wife? you might have come before.
"
"[Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.
"
"If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.
"
"Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
[p]fain have either.
"
"In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
"
"They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
"
"There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
"
"You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
[p]Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
[p]It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
"
"Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.
"
"[Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break your
[p]knave's pate.
"
"A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
[p]Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
"
"[Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon
[p]thee, hind!
"
"Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
[p]let me in.
"
"[Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
"
"Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.
"
"A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
[p]For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
[p]If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
"
"Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
"
"Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
[p]Herein you war against your reputation
[p]And draw within the compass of suspect
[p]The unviolated honour of your wife.
[p]Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
[p]Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
[p]Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
[p]And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
[p]Why at this time the doors are made against you.
[p]Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
[p]And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
[p]And about evening come yourself alone
[p]To know the reason of this strange restraint.
[p]If by strong hand you offer to break in
[p]Now in the stirring passage of the day,
[p]A vulgar comment will be made of it,
[p]And that supposed by the common rout
[p]Against your yet ungalled estimation
[p]That may with foul intrusion enter in
[p]And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
[p]For slander lives upon succession,
[p]For ever housed where it gets possession.
"
"You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
[p]And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
[p]I know a wench of excellent discourse,
[p]Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
[p]There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
[p]My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
[p]Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
[p]To her will we to dinner.
[p][To Angelo]
[p]Get you home
[p]And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
[p]Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
[p]For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
[p]Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
[p]Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
[p]Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
[p]I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
"
"I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
"
"Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
"
"And may it be that you have quite forgot
[p]A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
[p]Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
[p]Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
[p]If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
[p]Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
[p]Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
[p]Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
[p]Let not my sister read it in your eye;
[p]Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
[p]Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
[p]Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
[p]Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
[p]Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
[p]Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
[p]What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
[p]'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
[p]And let her read it in thy looks at board:
[p]Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
[p]Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.
[p]Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
[p]Being compact of credit, that you love us;
[p]Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
[p]We in your motion turn and you may move us.
[p]Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
[p]Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
[p]'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
[p]When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
"
"Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
[p]Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
[p]Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
[p]Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
[p]Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
[p]Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
[p]Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
[p]The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
[p]Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
[p]To make it wander in an unknown field?
[p]Are you a god? would you create me new?
[p]Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
[p]But if that I am I, then well I know
[p]Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
[p]Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
[p]Far more, far more to you do I decline.
[p]O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
[p]To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
[p]Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
[p]Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
[p]And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
[p]And in that glorious supposition think
[p]He gains by death that hath such means to die:
[p]Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
"
"What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
"
"Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
"
"It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
"
"For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
"
"Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
"
"As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
"
"Why call you me love? call my sister so.
"
"Thy sister's sister.
"
"That's my sister.
"
"No;
[p]It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
[p]Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
[p]My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
[p]My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.
"
"All this my sister is, or else should be.
"
"Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
[p]Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
[p]Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
[p]Give me thy hand.
"
"O, soft, air! hold you still:
[p]I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.
"
"Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?
"
"Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?
[p]am I myself?
"
"Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
"
"I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.
"
"What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?
"
"Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one
[p]that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
"
"What claim lays she to thee?
"
"Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
[p]horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
[p]being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
[p]being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
"
"What is she?
"
"A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may
[p]not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
[p]but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
[p]wondrous fat marriage.
"
"How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
"
"Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;
[p]and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
[p]lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
[p]warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
[p]Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
[p]she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.
"
"What complexion is she of?
"
"Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so
[p]clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over
[p]shoes in the grime of it.
"
"That's a fault that water will mend.
"
"No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.
"
"What's her name?
"
"Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's
[p]an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
[p]hip to hip.
"
"Then she bears some breadth?
"
"No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
[p]she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out
[p]countries in her.
"
"In what part of her body stands Ireland?
"
"Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.
"
"Where Scotland?
"
"I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.
"
"Where France?
"
"In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war
[p]against her heir.
"
"Where England?
"
"I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no
[p]whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,
[p]by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
"
"Where Spain?
"
"Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.
"
"Where America, the Indies?
"
"Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with
[p]rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
[p]aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
[p]armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
"
"Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
"
"Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
[p]drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me
[p]Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
[p]privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
[p]shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
[p]left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:
[p]And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
[p]faith and my heart of steel,
[p]She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
[p]me turn i' the wheel.
"
"Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
[p]An if the wind blow any way from shore,
[p]I will not harbour in this town to-night:
[p]If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
[p]Where I will walk till thou return to me.
[p]If every one knows us and we know none,
[p]'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
"
"As from a bear a man would run for life,
[p]So fly I from her that would be my wife.
"
"There's none but witches do inhabit here;
[p]And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
[p]She that doth call me husband, even my soul
[p]Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
[p]Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
[p]Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
[p]Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
[p]But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
[p]I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
"
"Master Antipholus,--
"
"Ay, that's my name.
"
"I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
[p]I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:
[p]The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
"
"What is your will that I shall do with this?
"
"What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.
"
"Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
"
"Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
[p]Go home with it and please your wife withal;
[p]And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
[p]And then receive my money for the chain.
"
"I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
[p]For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
"
"You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.
"
"What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
[p]But this I think, there's no man is so vain
[p]That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
[p]I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
[p]When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
[p]I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay
[p]If any ship put out, then straight away.
"
"You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
[p]And since I have not much importuned you;
[p]Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
[p]To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:
[p]Therefore make present satisfaction,
[p]Or I'll attach you by this officer.
"
"Even just the sum that I do owe to you
[p]Is growing to me by Antipholus,
[p]And in the instant that I met with you
[p]He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
[p]I shall receive the money for the same.
[p]Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
[p]I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
[p][Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus]
[p]from the courtezan's]
"
"That labour may you save: see where he comes.
"
"While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
[p]And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
[p]Among my wife and her confederates,
[p]For locking me out of my doors by day.
[p]But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
[p]Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.
"
"I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.
"
"A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
[p]I promised your presence and the chain;
[p]But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
[p]Belike you thought our love would last too long,
[p]If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
"
"Saving your merry humour, here's the note
[p]How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
[p]The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
[p]Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
[p]Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
[p]I pray you, see him presently discharged,
[p]For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.
"
"I am not furnish'd with the present money;
[p]Besides, I have some business in the town.
[p]Good signior, take the stranger to my house
[p]And with you take the chain and bid my wife
[p]Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
[p]Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
"
"Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
"
"No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
"
"Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
"
"An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
[p]Or else you may return without your money.
"
"Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
[p]Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
[p]And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
"
"Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
[p]Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
[p]I should have chid you for not bringing it,
[p]But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
"
"The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.
"
"You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!
"
"Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.
"
"Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
[p]Either send the chain or send me by some token.
"
"Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
[p]where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
"
"My business cannot brook this dalliance.
[p]Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
[p]If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
"
"I answer you! what should I answer you?
"
"The money that you owe me for the chain.
"
"I owe you none till I receive the chain.
"
"You know I gave it you half an hour since.
"
"You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
"
"You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
[p]Consider how it stands upon my credit.
"
"Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
"
"I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.
"
"This touches me in reputation.
[p]Either consent to pay this sum for me
[p]Or I attach you by this officer.
"
"Consent to pay thee that I never had!
[p]Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.
"
"Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
[p]I would not spare my brother in this case,
[p]If he should scorn me so apparently.
"
"I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
"
"I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
[p]But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
[p]As all the metal in your shop will answer.
"
"Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,
[p]To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.
"
"Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
[p]That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
[p]And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
[p]I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
[p]The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.
[p]The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
[p]Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
[p]But for their owner, master, and yourself.
"
"How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
[p]What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
"
"A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
"
"Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
[p]And told thee to what purpose and what end.
"
"You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
[p]You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
"
"I will debate this matter at more leisure
[p]And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
[p]To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
[p]Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
[p]That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
[p]There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:
[p]Tell her I am arrested in the street
[p]And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!
[p]On, officer, to prison till it come.
[p][Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and]
[p]Antipholus of Ephesus]
"
"To Adriana! that is where we dined,
[p]Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
[p]She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
[p]Thither I must, although against my will,
[p]For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.
"
"Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
[p]Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
[p]That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
[p]Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
[p]What observation madest thou in this case
[p]Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
"
"First he denied you had in him no right.
"
"He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
"
"Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
"
"And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
"
"Then pleaded I for you.
"
"And what said he?
"
"That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
"
"With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
"
"With words that in an honest suit might move.
[p]First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
"
"Didst speak him fair?
"
"Have patience, I beseech.
"
"I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
[p]My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
[p]He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
[p]Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
[p]Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
[p]Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
"
"Who would be jealous then of such a one?
[p]No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
"
"Ah, but I think him better than I say,
[p]And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
[p]Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
[p]My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
"
"Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.
"
"How hast thou lost thy breath?
"
"By running fast.
"
"Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?
"
"No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
[p]A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
[p]One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
[p]A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
[p]A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
[p]A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
[p]countermands
[p]The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
[p]A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
[p]One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.
"
"Why, man, what is the matter?
"
"I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.
"
"What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.
"
"I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
[p]But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
[p]Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
"
"Go fetch it, sister.
[p][Exit Luciana]
[p]This I wonder at,
[p]That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
[p]Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
"
"Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
[p]A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?
"
"What, the chain?
"
"No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:
[p]It was two ere I left him, and now the clock
[p]strikes one.
"
"The hours come back! that did I never hear.
"
"O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for
[p]very fear.
"
"As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!
"
"Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's
[p]worth, to season.
[p]Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
[p]That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
[p]If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
[p]Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
"
"Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;
[p]And bring thy master home immediately.
[p]Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
[p]Conceit, my comfort and my injury.
"
"There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
[p]As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
[p]And every one doth call me by my name.
[p]Some tender money to me; some invite me;
[p]Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
[p]Some offer me commodities to buy:
[p]Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
[p]And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
[p]And therewithal took measure of my body.
[p]Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
[p]And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
"
"Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have
[p]you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?
"
"What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?
"
"Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
[p]that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's
[p]skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came
[p]behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you
[p]forsake your liberty.
"
"I understand thee not.
"
"No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a
[p]bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
[p]that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob
[p]and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed
[p]men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
[p]his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
[p]morris-pike.
"
"What, thou meanest an officer?
"
"Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings
[p]any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that
[p]thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God
[p]give you good rest!'
"
"Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any
"
"Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the
[p]bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were
[p]you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy
[p]Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
[p]deliver you.
"
"The fellow is distract, and so am I;
[p]And here we wander in illusions:
[p]Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
"
"Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
[p]I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:
[p]Is that the chain you promised me to-day?
"
"Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
"
"Master, is this Mistress Satan?
"
"It is the devil.
"
"Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here
[p]she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
[p]comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as
[p]much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is
[p]written, they appear to men like angels of light:
[p]light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;
[p]ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.
"
"Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
[p]Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?
"
"Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a
[p]long spoon.
"
"Why, Dromio?
"
"Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with
[p]the devil.
"
"Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
[p]Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
[p]I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
"
"Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
[p]Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
[p]And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
"
"Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
[p]A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
[p]A nut, a cherry-stone;
[p]But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
[p]Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
[p]The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.
"
"I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
[p]I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
"
"Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
"
"'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.
"
"Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
[p]Else would he never so demean himself.
[p]A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
[p]And for the same he promised me a chain:
[p]Both one and other he denies me now.
[p]The reason that I gather he is mad,
[p]Besides this present instance of his rage,
[p]Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
[p]Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
[p]Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
[p]On purpose shut the doors against his way.
[p]My way is now to hie home to his house,
[p]And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
[p]He rush'd into my house and took perforce
[p]My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
[p]For forty ducats is too much to lose.
"
"Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
[p]I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
[p]To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
[p]My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
[p]And will not lightly trust the messenger
[p]That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
[p]I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
[p][Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end]
[p]Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
[p]How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?
"
"Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
"
"But where's the money?
"
"Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
"
"Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
"
"I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
"
"To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
"
"To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.
"
"And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
"
"Good sir, be patient.
"
"Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.
"
"Good, now, hold thy tongue.
"
"Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
"
"Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
"
"I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
[p]your blows.
"
"Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an
[p]ass.
"
"I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
[p]ears. I have served him from the hour of my
[p]nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
[p]hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
[p]heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
[p]with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
[p]raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
[p]it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
[p]I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
[p]beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
[p]lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
"
"Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
"
"Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
[p]rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
[p]rope's-end.'
"
"Wilt thou still talk?
"
"How say you now? is not your husband mad?
"
"His incivility confirms no less.
[p]Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
[p]Establish him in his true sense again,
[p]And I will please you what you will demand.
"
"Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
"
"Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!
"
"Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
"
"There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
"
"I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
[p]To yield possession to my holy prayers
[p]And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
[p]I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
"
"Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
"
"O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
"
"You minion, you, are these your customers?
[p]Did this companion with the saffron face
[p]Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
[p]Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
[p]And I denied to enter in my house?
"
"O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
[p]Where would you had remain'd until this time,
[p]Free from these slanders and this open shame!
"
"Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
"
"Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
"
"Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
"
"Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
"
"And did not she herself revile me there?
"
"Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
"
"Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
"
"Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
"
"And did not I in rage depart from thence?
"
"In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
[p]That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
"
"Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
"
"It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
[p]And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
"
"Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
"
"Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
[p]By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
"
"Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
[p]But surely master, not a rag of money.
"
"Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
"
"He came to me and I deliver'd it.
"
"And I am witness with her that she did.
"
"God and the rope-maker bear me witness
[p]That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
"
"Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
[p]I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
[p]They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
"
"Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
[p]And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
"
"I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
"
"And, gentle master, I received no gold;
[p]But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
"
"Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
"
"Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
[p]And art confederate with a damned pack
[p]To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
[p]But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
[p]That would behold in me this shameful sport.
[p][Enter three or four, and offer to bind him.]
[p]He strives]
"
"O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.
"
"More company! The fiend is strong within him.
"
"Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
"
"What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
[p]I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
[p]To make a rescue?
"
"Masters, let him go
[p]He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
"
"Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
"
"What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
[p]Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
[p]Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
"
"He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
[p]The debt he owes will be required of me.
"
"I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
[p]Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
[p]And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
[p]Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
[p]Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
"
"O most unhappy strumpet!
"
"Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
"
"Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?
"
"Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
[p]cry 'The devil!'
"
"God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
"
"Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
[p][Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and]
[p]Courtezan]
[p]Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
"
"One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?
"
"I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
"
"Two hundred ducats.
"
"Say, how grows it due?
"
"Due for a chain your husband had of him.
"
"He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
"
"When as your husband all in rage to-day
[p]Came to my house and took away my ring--
[p]The ring I saw upon his finger now--
[p]Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
"
"It may be so, but I did never see it.
[p]Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
[p]I long to know the truth hereof at large.
[p][Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn,]
[p]and DROMIO of Syracuse]
"
"God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
"
"And come with naked swords.
[p]Let's call more help to have them bound again.
"
"Away! they'll kill us.
[p][Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio]
[p]of Syracuse]
"
"I see these witches are afraid of swords.
"
"She that would be your wife now ran from you.
"
"Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
[p]I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
"
"Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us
[p]no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
[p]methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
[p]the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
[p]me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
[p]turn witch.
"
"I will not stay to-night for all the town;
[p]Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
"
"I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
[p]But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
[p]Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
"
"How is the man esteemed here in the city?
"
"Of very reverend reputation, sir,
[p]Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
[p]Second to none that lives here in the city:
[p]His word might bear my wealth at any time.
"
"Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
"
"'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
[p]Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
[p]Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
[p]Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
[p]That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
[p]And, not without some scandal to yourself,
[p]With circumstance and oaths so to deny
[p]This chain which now you wear so openly:
[p]Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
[p]You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
[p]Who, but for staying on our controversy,
[p]Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
[p]This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
"
"I think I had; I never did deny it.
"
"Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
"
"Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
"
"These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.
[p]Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest
[p]To walk where any honest man resort.
"
"Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
[p]I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
[p]Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.
"
"I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
"
"Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
[p]Some get within him, take his sword away:
[p]Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.
"
"Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!
[p]This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!
[p][Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse]
[p]to the Priory]
"
"Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
"
"To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
[p]Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
[p]And bear him home for his recovery.
"
"I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
"
"I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
"
"How long hath this possession held the man?
"
"This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
[p]And much different from the man he was;
[p]But till this afternoon his passion
[p]Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
"
"Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
[p]Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
[p]Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
[p]A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
[p]Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
[p]Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
"
"To none of these, except it be the last;
[p]Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
"
"You should for that have reprehended him.
"
"Why, so I did.
"
"Ay, but not rough enough.
"
"As roughly as my modesty would let me.
"
"Haply, in private.
"
"And in assemblies too.
"
"Ay, but not enough.
"
"It was the copy of our conference:
[p]In bed he slept not for my urging it;
[p]At board he fed not for my urging it;
[p]Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
[p]In company I often glanced it;
[p]Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
"
"And thereof came it that the man was mad.
[p]The venom clamours of a jealous woman
[p]Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
[p]It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
[p]And therefore comes it that his head is light.
[p]Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
[p]Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
[p]Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
[p]And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
[p]Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
[p]Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
[p]But moody and dull melancholy,
[p]Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
[p]And at her heels a huge infectious troop
[p]Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
[p]In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
[p]To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
[p]The consequence is then thy jealous fits
[p]Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
"
"She never reprehended him but mildly,
[p]When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
[p]Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?
"
"She did betray me to my own reproof.
[p]Good people enter and lay hold on him.
"
"No, not a creature enters in my house.
"
"Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
"
"Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
[p]And it shall privilege him from your hands
[p]Till I have brought him to his wits again,
[p]Or lose my labour in assaying it.
"
"I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
[p]Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
[p]And will have no attorney but myself;
[p]And therefore let me have him home with me.
"
"Be patient; for I will not let him stir
[p]Till I have used the approved means I have,
[p]With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
[p]To make of him a formal man again:
[p]It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
[p]A charitable duty of my order.
[p]Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
"
"I will not hence and leave my husband here:
[p]And ill it doth beseem your holiness
[p]To separate the husband and the wife.
"
"Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.
"
"Complain unto the duke of this indignity.
"
"Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
[p]And never rise until my tears and prayers
[p]Have won his grace to come in person hither
[p]And take perforce my husband from the abbess.
"
"By this, I think, the dial points at five:
[p]Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person
[p]Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
[p]The place of death and sorry execution,
[p]Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
"
"Upon what cause?
"
"To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
[p]Who put unluckily into this bay
[p]Against the laws and statutes of this town,
[p]Beheaded publicly for his offence.
"
"See where they come: we will behold his death.
"
"Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.
[p][Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the]
[p]Headsman and other Officers]
"
"Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
[p]If any friend will pay the sum for him,
[p]He shall not die; so much we tender him.
"
"Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!
"
"She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
[p]It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
"
"May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
[p]Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
[p]At your important letters,--this ill day
[p]A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
[p]That desperately he hurried through the street,
[p]With him his bondman, all as mad as he--
[p]Doing displeasure to the citizens
[p]By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
[p]Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
[p]Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
[p]Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
[p]That here and there his fury had committed.
[p]Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
[p]He broke from those that had the guard of him;
[p]And with his mad attendant and himself,
[p]Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
[p]Met us again and madly bent on us,
[p]Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
[p]We came again to bind them. Then they fled
[p]Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
[p]And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
[p]And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
[p]Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
[p]Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
[p]Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
"
"Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
[p]And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
[p]When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
[p]To do him all the grace and good I could.
[p]Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
[p]And bid the lady abbess come to me.
[p]I will determine this before I stir.
"
"O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
[p]My master and his man are both broke loose,
[p]Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
[p]Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
[p]And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
[p]Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
[p]My master preaches patience to him and the while
[p]His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
[p]And sure, unless you send some present help,
[p]Between them they will kill the conjurer.
"
"Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
[p]And that is false thou dost report to us.
"
"Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
[p]I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
[p]He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
[p]To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
[p][Cry within]
[p]Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!
"
"Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!
"
"Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
[p]That he is borne about invisible:
[p]Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
[p]And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
"
"Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!
[p]Even for the service that long since I did thee,
[p]When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
[p]Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
[p]That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
"
"Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
[p]I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.
"
"Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
[p]She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
[p]That hath abused and dishonour'd me
[p]Even in the strength and height of injury!
[p]Beyond imagination is the wrong
[p]That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
"
"Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
"
"This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
[p]While she with harlots feasted in my house.
"
"A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?
"
"No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
[p]To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
[p]As this is false he burdens me withal!
"
"Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
[p]But she tells to your highness simple truth!
"
"O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
[p]In this the madman justly chargeth them.
"
"My liege, I am advised what I say,
[p]Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
[p]Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
[p]Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
[p]This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
[p]That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
[p]Could witness it, for he was with me then;
[p]Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
[p]Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
[p]Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
[p]Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
[p]I went to seek him: in the street I met him
[p]And in his company that gentleman.
[p]There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
[p]That I this day of him received the chain,
[p]Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
[p]He did arrest me with an officer.
[p]I did obey, and sent my peasant home
[p]For certain ducats: he with none return'd
[p]Then fairly I bespoke the officer
[p]To go in person with me to my house.
[p]By the way we met
[p]My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
[p]Of vile confederates. Along with them
[p]They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
[p]A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
[p]A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
[p]A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
[p]A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
[p]Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
[p]And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
[p]And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
[p]Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
[p]They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
[p]And in a dark and dankish vault at home
[p]There left me and my man, both bound together;
[p]Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
[p]I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
[p]Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
[p]To give me ample satisfaction
[p]For these deep shames and great indignities.
"
"My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
[p]That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.
"
"But had he such a chain of thee or no?
"
"He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
[p]These people saw the chain about his neck.
"
"Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
[p]Heard you confess you had the chain of him
[p]After you first forswore it on the mart:
[p]And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
[p]And then you fled into this abbey here,
[p]From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
"
"I never came within these abbey-walls,
[p]Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
[p]I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
[p]And this is false you burden me withal.
"
"Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
[p]I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
[p]If here you housed him, here he would have been;
[p]If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
[p]You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
[p]Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
"
"Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
"
"He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
"
"'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
"
"Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
"
"As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.
"
"Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
[p]I think you are all mated or stark mad.
"
"Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
[p]Haply I see a friend will save my life
[p]And pay the sum that may deliver me.
"
"Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
"
"Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
[p]And is not that your bondman, Dromio?
"
"Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
[p]But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
[p]Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
"
"I am sure you both of you remember me.
"
"Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
[p]For lately we were bound, as you are now
[p]You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
"
"Why look you strange on me? you know me well.
"
"I never saw you in my life till now.
"
"O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
[p]And careful hours with time's deformed hand
[p]Have written strange defeatures in my face:
[p]But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
"
"Neither.
"
"Dromio, nor thou?
"
"No, trust me, sir, nor I.
"
"I am sure thou dost.
"
"Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
[p]man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
"
"Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
[p]Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
[p]In seven short years, that here my only son
[p]Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
[p]Though now this grained face of mine be hid
[p]In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
[p]And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
[p]Yet hath my night of life some memory,
[p]My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
[p]My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
[p]All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
[p]Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
"
"I never saw my father in my life.
"
"But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
[p]Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
[p]Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
"
"The duke and all that know me in the city
[p]Can witness with me that it is not so
[p]I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.
"
"I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
[p]Have I been patron to Antipholus,
[p]During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
[p]I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
[p][Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and]
[p]DROMIO of Syracuse]
"
"Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
"
"I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
"
"One of these men is Genius to the other;
[p]And so of these. Which is the natural man,
[p]And which the spirit? who deciphers them?
"
"I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.
"
"I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.
"
"AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?
"
"O, my old master! who hath bound him here?
"
"Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
[p]And gain a husband by his liberty.
[p]Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
[p]That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
[p]That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
[p]O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
[p]And speak unto the same AEmilia!
"
"If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:
[p]If thou art she, tell me where is that son
[p]That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
"
"By men of Epidamnum he and I
[p]And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
[p]But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
[p]By force took Dromio and my son from them
[p]And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
[p]What then became of them I cannot tell
[p]I to this fortune that you see me in.
"
"Why, here begins his morning story right;
[p]These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
[p]And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
[p]Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
[p]These are the parents to these children,
[p]Which accidentally are met together.
[p]Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?
"
"No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
"
"Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
"
"I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--
"
"And I with him.
"
"Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
[p]Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.
"
"Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
"
"I, gentle mistress.
"
"And are not you my husband?
"
"No; I say nay to that.
"
"And so do I; yet did she call me so:
[p]And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
[p]Did call me brother.
[p][To Luciana]
[p]What I told you then,
[p]I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
[p]If this be not a dream I see and hear.
"
"That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
"
"I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
"
"And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
"
"I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
"
"I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
[p]By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
"
"No, none by me.
"
"This purse of ducats I received from you,
[p]And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
[p]I see we still did meet each other's man,
[p]And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
[p]And thereupon these errors are arose.
"
"These ducats pawn I for my father here.
"
"It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
"
"Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
"
"There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.
"
"Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
[p]To go with us into the abbey here
[p]And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
[p]And all that are assembled in this place,
[p]That by this sympathized one day's error
[p]Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
[p]And we shall make full satisfaction.
[p]Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
[p]Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
[p]My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
[p]The duke, my husband and my children both,
[p]And you the calendars of their nativity,
[p]Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;
[p]After so long grief, such festivity!
"
"With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.
[p][Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus]
[p]of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus]
"
"Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
"
"Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
"
"Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
"
"He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:
[p]Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
[p]Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
"
"There is a fat friend at your master's house,
[p]That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:
[p]She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
"
"Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
[p]I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
[p]Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
"
"Not I, sir; you are my elder.
"
"That's a question: how shall we try it?
"
"We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.
"
"Nay, then, thus:
[p]We came into the world like brother and brother;
[p]And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
"
"Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
[p]Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
[p]And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
[p]When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
[p]The endeavor of this present breath may buy
[p]That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
[p]And make us heirs of all eternity.
[p]Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
[p]That war against your own affections
[p]And the huge army of the world's desires,--
[p]Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
[p]Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
[p]Our court shall be a little Academe,
[p]Still and contemplative in living art.
[p]You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
[p]Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
[p]My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
[p]That are recorded in this schedule here:
[p]Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
[p]That his own hand may strike his honour down
[p]That violates the smallest branch herein:
[p]If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
[p]Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
"
"I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
[p]The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
[p]Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
[p]Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
"
"My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
[p]The grosser manner of these world's delights
[p]He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
[p]To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
[p]With all these living in philosophy.
"
"I can but say their protestation over;
[p]So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
[p]That is, to live and study here three years.
[p]But there are other strict observances;
[p]As, not to see a woman in that term,
[p]Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
[p]And one day in a week to touch no food
[p]And but one meal on every day beside,
[p]The which I hope is not enrolled there;
[p]And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
[p]And not be seen to wink of all the day--
[p]When I was wont to think no harm all night
[p]And make a dark night too of half the day--
[p]Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
[p]O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
[p]Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
"
"Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
"
"Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
[p]I only swore to study with your grace
[p]And stay here in your court for three years' space.
"
"You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
"
"By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
[p]What is the end of study? let me know.
"
"Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
"
"Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
"
"Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
"
"Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
[p]To know the thing I am forbid to know:
[p]As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
[p]When I to feast expressly am forbid;
[p]Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
[p]When mistresses from common sense are hid;
[p]Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
[p]Study to break it and not break my troth.
[p]If study's gain be thus and this be so,
[p]Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
[p]Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
"
"These be the stops that hinder study quite
[p]And train our intellects to vain delight.
"
"Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
[p]Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
[p]As, painfully to pore upon a book
[p]To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
[p]Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
[p]Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
[p]So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
[p]Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
[p]Study me how to please the eye indeed
[p]By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
[p]Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
[p]And give him light that it was blinded by.
[p]Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
[p]That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
[p]Small have continual plodders ever won
[p]Save base authority from others' books
[p]These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
[p]That give a name to every fixed star
[p]Have no more profit of their shining nights
[p]Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
[p]Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
[p]And every godfather can give a name.
"
"How well he's read, to reason against reading!
"
"Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
"
"He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
"
"The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
"
"How follows that?
"
"Fit in his place and time.
"
"In reason nothing.
"
"Something then in rhyme.
"
"Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
[p]That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
"
"Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
[p]Before the birds have any cause to sing?
[p]Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
[p]At Christmas I no more desire a rose
[p]Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
[p]But like of each thing that in season grows.
[p]So you, to study now it is too late,
[p]Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
"
"Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
"
"No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
[p]And though I have for barbarism spoke more
[p]Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
[p]Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
[p]And bide the penance of each three years' day.
[p]Give me the paper; let me read the same;
[p]And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
"
"How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
"
"[Reads] 'Item, That no woman shall come within a
[p]mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
"
"Four days ago.
"
"Let's see the penalty.
[p][Reads]
[p]'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
"
"Marry, that did I.
"
"Sweet lord, and why?
"
"To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
"
"A dangerous law against gentility!
[p][Reads]
[p]'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
[p]within the term of three years, he shall endure such
[p]public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
[p]This article, my liege, yourself must break;
[p]For well you know here comes in embassy
[p]The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
[p]A maid of grace and complete majesty--
[p]About surrender up of Aquitaine
[p]To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
[p]Therefore this article is made in vain,
[p]Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
"
"What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
"
"So study evermore is overshot:
[p]While it doth study to have what it would
[p]It doth forget to do the thing it should,
[p]And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
[p]'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.
"
"We must of force dispense with this decree;
[p]She must lie here on mere necessity.
"
"Necessity will make us all forsworn
[p]Three thousand times within this three years' space;
[p]For every man with his affects is born,
[p]Not by might master'd but by special grace:
[p]If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
[p]I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
[p]So to the laws at large I write my name:
[p][Subscribes]
[p]And he that breaks them in the least degree
[p]Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
[p]Suggestions are to other as to me;
[p]But I believe, although I seem so loath,
[p]I am the last that will last keep his oath.
[p]But is there no quick recreation granted?
"
"Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
[p]With a refined traveller of Spain;
[p]A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
[p]That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
[p]One whom the music of his own vain tongue
[p]Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
[p]A man of complements, whom right and wrong
[p]Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
[p]This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
[p]For interim to our studies shall relate
[p]In high-born words the worth of many a knight
[p]From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
[p]How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
[p]But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
[p]And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
"
"Armado is a most illustrious wight,
[p]A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
"
"Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
[p]And so to study, three years is but short.
"
"Which is the duke's own person?
"
"This, fellow: what wouldst?
"
"I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
[p]grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
[p]in flesh and blood.
"
"This is he.
"
"Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
[p]abroad: this letter will tell you more.
"
"Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
"
"A letter from the magnificent Armado.
"
"How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
"
"A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
"
"To hear? or forbear laughing?
"
"To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
[p]forbear both.
"
"Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
[p]climb in the merriness.
"
"The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
[p]The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
"
"In what manner?
"
"In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
[p]I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
[p]her upon the form, and taken following her into the
[p]park; which, put together, is in manner and form
[p]following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
[p]manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
[p]in some form.
"
"For the following, sir?
"
"As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
[p]the right!
"
"Will you hear this letter with attention?
"
"As we would hear an oracle.
"
"Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
"
"[Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
[p]sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
[p]and body's fostering patron.'
"
"Not a word of Costard yet.
"
"[Reads] 'So it is,'--
"
"It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
[p]telling true, but so.
"
"Peace!
"
"Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
"
"No words!
"
"Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
"
"[Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
[p]melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
[p]to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
[p]air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
[p]walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
[p]beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
[p]to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
[p]for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
[p]I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
[p]for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
[p]that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
[p]from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
[p]here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
[p]but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
[p]and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
[p]knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
[p]swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--
"
"Me?
"
"[Reads] 'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--
"
"Me?
"
"[Reads] 'that shallow vassal,'--
"
"Still me?
"
"[Reads] 'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
"
"O, me!
"
"[Reads] 'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
[p]established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
[p]which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
[p]wherewith,--
"
"With a wench.
"
"[Reads] 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
[p]female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
[p]woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
[p]have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
[p]punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
[p]Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
[p]estimation.'
"
"'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.
"
"[Reads] 'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
[p]called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
[p]swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
[p]and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
[p]her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
[p]and heart-burning heat of duty.
[p]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
"
"This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
[p]that ever I heard.
"
"Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
[p]you to this?
"
"Sir, I confess the wench.
"
"Did you hear the proclamation?
"
"I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
[p]the marking of it.
"
"It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
[p]with a wench.
"
"I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
"
"Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'
"
"This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
"
"It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
"
"If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
"
"This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
"
"This maid will serve my turn, sir.
"
"Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
[p]a week with bran and water.
"
"I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
"
"And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
[p]My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
[p]And go we, lords, to put in practise that
[p]Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
"
"I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
[p]These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
[p]Sirrah, come on.
"
"I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
[p]taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
[p]girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
[p]prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
[p]till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
"
"Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
[p]grows melancholy?
"
"A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
"
"Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
"
"No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
"
"How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
[p]tender juvenal?
"
"By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
"
"Why tough senior? why tough senior?
"
"Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
"
"I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
[p]appertaining to thy young days, which we may
[p]nominate tender.
"
"And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
[p]old time, which we may name tough.
"
"Pretty and apt.
"
"How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
[p]I apt, and my saying pretty?
"
"Thou pretty, because little.
"
"Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
"
"And therefore apt, because quick.
"
"Speak you this in my praise, master?
"
"In thy condign praise.
"
"I will praise an eel with the same praise.
"
"What, that an eel is ingenious?
"
"That an eel is quick.
"
"I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
"
"I am answered, sir.
"
"I love not to be crossed.
"
"[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
"
"I have promised to study three years with the duke.
"
"You may do it in an hour, sir.
"
"Impossible.
"
"How many is one thrice told?
"
"I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
"
"You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
"
"I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
[p]complete man.
"
"Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
[p]deuce-ace amounts to.
"
"It doth amount to one more than two.
"
"Which the base vulgar do call three.
"
"True.
"
"Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
[p]is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
[p]easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
[p]study three years in two words, the dancing horse
[p]will tell you.
"
"A most fine figure!
"
"To prove you a cipher.
"
"I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
[p]base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
[p]base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
[p]of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
[p]thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
[p]ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
[p]courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
[p]outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
[p]have been in love?
"
"Hercules, master.
"
"Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
[p]more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
[p]repute and carriage.
"
"Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
[p]carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
[p]like a porter: and he was in love.
"
"O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
[p]excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
[p]carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
[p]love, my dear Moth?
"
"A woman, master.
"
"Of what complexion?
"
"Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
"
"Tell me precisely of what complexion.
"
"Of the sea-water green, sir.
"
"Is that one of the four complexions?
"
"As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
"
"Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
[p]love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
[p]for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
"
"It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
"
"My love is most immaculate white and red.
"
"Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
[p]such colours.
"
"Define, define, well-educated infant.
"
"My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
"
"Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
[p]pathetical!
"
"If she be made of white and red,
[p]Her faults will ne'er be known,
[p]For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
[p]And fears by pale white shown:
[p]Then if she fear, or be to blame,
[p]By this you shall not know,
[p]For still her cheeks possess the same
[p]Which native she doth owe.
[p]A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
[p]white and red.
"
"Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
"
"The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
[p]three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
[p]found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
[p]the writing nor the tune.
"
"I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
[p]example my digression by some mighty precedent.
[p]Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
[p]park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
"
"[Aside] To be whipped; and yet a better love than
[p]my master.
"
"Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
"
"And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
"
"I say, sing.
"
"Forbear till this company be past.
"
"Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
[p]safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
[p]nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
[p]For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
[p]is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
"
"I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
"
"Man?
"
"I will visit thee at the lodge.
"
"That's hereby.
"
"I know where it is situate.
"
"Lord, how wise you are!
"
"I will tell thee wonders.
"
"With that face?
"
"I love thee.
"
"So I heard you say.
"
"And so, farewell.
"
"Fair weather after you!
"
"Come, Jaquenetta, away!
"
"Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
[p]be pardoned.
"
"Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
[p]full stomach.
"
"Thou shalt be heavily punished.
"
"I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
[p]are but lightly rewarded.
"
"Take away this villain; shut him up.
"
"Come, you transgressing slave; away!
"
"Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
"
"No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
"
"Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
[p]that I have seen, some shall see.
"
"What shall some see?
"
"Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
[p]It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
[p]words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
[p]God I have as little patience as another man; and
[p]therefore I can be quiet.
"
"I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
[p]her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
[p]is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
[p]is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
[p]how can that be true love which is falsely
[p]attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
[p]there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
[p]tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
[p]Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
[p]Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
[p]and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
[p]The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
[p]the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
[p]not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
[p]glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
[p]be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
[p]he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
[p]for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
[p]write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.
"
"Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
[p]Consider who the king your father sends,
[p]To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
[p]Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
[p]To parley with the sole inheritor
[p]Of all perfections that a man may owe,
[p]Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
[p]Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
[p]Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
[p]As Nature was in making graces dear
[p]When she did starve the general world beside
[p]And prodigally gave them all to you.
"
"Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
[p]Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
[p]Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
[p]Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
[p]I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
[p]Than you much willing to be counted wise
[p]In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
[p]But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
[p]You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
[p]Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
[p]Till painful study shall outwear three years,
[p]No woman may approach his silent court:
[p]Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
[p]Before we enter his forbidden gates,
[p]To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
[p]Bold of your worthiness, we single you
[p]As our best-moving fair solicitor.
[p]Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
[p]On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
[p]Importunes personal conference with his grace:
[p]Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
[p]Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
"
"Proud of employment, willingly I go.
"
"All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
[p][Exit BOYET]
[p]Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
[p]That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?
"
"Lord Longaville is one.
"
"Know you the man?
"
"I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
[p]Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
[p]Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
[p]In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
[p]A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
[p]Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
[p]Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
[p]The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
[p]If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
[p]Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
[p]Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
[p]It should none spare that come within his power.
"
"Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?
"
"They say so most that most his humours know.
"
"Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
[p]Who are the rest?
"
"The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
[p]Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
[p]Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
[p]For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
[p]And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
[p]I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
[p]And much too little of that good I saw
[p]Is my report to his great worthiness.
"
"Another of these students at that time
[p]Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
[p]Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
[p]Within the limit of becoming mirth,
[p]I never spent an hour's talk withal:
[p]His eye begets occasion for his wit;
[p]For every object that the one doth catch
[p]The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
[p]Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
[p]Delivers in such apt and gracious words
[p]That aged ears play truant at his tales
[p]And younger hearings are quite ravished;
[p]So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
"
"God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
[p]That every one her own hath garnished
[p]With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
"
"Here comes Boyet.
"
"Now, what admittance, lord?
"
"Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
[p]And he and his competitors in oath
[p]Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
[p]Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
[p]He rather means to lodge you in the field,
[p]Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
[p]Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
[p]To let you enter his unpeopled house.
[p]Here comes Navarre.
[p][Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and]
[p]Attendants]
"
"Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
"
"'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
[p]not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
[p]yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
"
"You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
"
"I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
"
"Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
"
"Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
"
"Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
"
"Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.
"
"Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
"
"Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
[p]Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
[p]I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
[p]Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
[p]And sin to break it.
[p]But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
[p]To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
[p]Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
[p]And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
"
"Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
"
"You will the sooner, that I were away;
[p]For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
"
"Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
"
"Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
"
"I know you did.
"
"How needless was it then to ask the question!
"
"You must not be so quick.
"
"'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
"
"Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
"
"Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
"
"What time o' day?
"
"The hour that fools should ask.
"
"Now fair befall your mask!
"
"Fair fall the face it covers!
"
"And send you many lovers!
"
"Amen, so you be none.
"
"Nay, then will I be gone.
"
"Madam, your father here doth intimate
[p]The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
[p]Being but the one half of an entire sum
[p]Disbursed by my father in his wars.
[p]But say that he or we, as neither have,
[p]Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
[p]A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
[p]One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
[p]Although not valued to the money's worth.
[p]If then the king your father will restore
[p]But that one half which is unsatisfied,
[p]We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
[p]And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
[p]But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
[p]For here he doth demand to have repaid
[p]A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
[p]On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
[p]To have his title live in Aquitaine;
[p]Which we much rather had depart withal
[p]And have the money by our father lent
[p]Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
[p]Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
[p]From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
[p]A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
[p]And go well satisfied to France again.
"
"You do the king my father too much wrong
[p]And wrong the reputation of your name,
[p]In so unseeming to confess receipt
[p]Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
"
"I do protest I never heard of it;
[p]And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
[p]Or yield up Aquitaine.
"
"We arrest your word.
[p]Boyet, you can produce acquittances
[p]For such a sum from special officers
[p]Of Charles his father.
"
"Satisfy me so.
"
"So please your grace, the packet is not come
[p]Where that and other specialties are bound:
[p]To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
"
"It shall suffice me: at which interview
[p]All liberal reason I will yield unto.
[p]Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
[p]As honour without breach of honour may
[p]Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
[p]You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
[p]But here without you shall be so received
[p]As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
[p]Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
[p]Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
[p]To-morrow shall we visit you again.
"
"Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
"
"Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
"
"Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
"
"Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
"
"I would you heard it groan.
"
"Is the fool sick?
"
"Sick at the heart.
"
"Alack, let it blood.
"
"Would that do it good?
"
"My physic says 'ay.'
"
"Will you prick't with your eye?
"
"No point, with my knife.
"
"Now, God save thy life!
"
"And yours from long living!
"
"I cannot stay thanksgiving.
"
"Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
"
"The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
"
"A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
"
"I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
"
"A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
"
"Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
"
"She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
"
"Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
"
"Her mother's, I have heard.
"
"God's blessing on your beard!
"
"Good sir, be not offended.
[p]She is an heir of Falconbridge.
"
"Nay, my choler is ended.
[p]She is a most sweet lady.
"
"Not unlike, sir, that may be.
"
"What's her name in the cap?
"
"Rosaline, by good hap.
"
"Is she wedded or no?
"
"To her will, sir, or so.
"
"You are welcome, sir: adieu.
"
"Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
"
"That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
[p]Not a word with him but a jest.
"
"And every jest but a word.
"
"It was well done of you to take him at his word.
"
"I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
"
"Two hot sheeps, marry.
"
"And wherefore not ships?
[p]No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
"
"You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
"
"So you grant pasture for me.
"
"Not so, gentle beast:
[p]My lips are no common, though several they be.
"
"Belonging to whom?
"
"To my fortunes and me.
"
"Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
[p]This civil war of wits were much better used
[p]On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.
"
"If my observation, which very seldom lies,
[p]By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
[p]Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
"
"With what?
"
"With that which we lovers entitle affected.
"
"Your reason?
"
"Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
[p]To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
[p]His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
[p]Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
[p]His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
[p]Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
[p]All senses to that sense did make their repair,
[p]To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
[p]Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
[p]As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
[p]Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
[p]Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
[p]His face's own margent did quote such amazes
[p]That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
[p]I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
[p]An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
"
"Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
"
"But to speak that in words which his eye hath
[p]disclosed.
[p]I only have made a mouth of his eye,
[p]By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
"
"Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.
"
"He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
"
"Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.
"
"Do you hear, my mad wenches?
"
"No.
"
"What then, do you see?
"
"Ay, our way to be gone.
"
"You are too hard for me.
"
"Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
"
"Concolinel.
"
"Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
[p]give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
[p]hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.
"
"Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
"
"How meanest thou? brawling in French?
"
"No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
[p]the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
[p]it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
[p]sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
[p]swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
[p]the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
[p]love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
[p]your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
[p]doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
[p]your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
[p]keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
[p]These are complements, these are humours; these
[p]betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
[p]these; and make them men of note--do you note
[p]me?--that most are affected to these.
"
"How hast thou purchased this experience?
"
"By my penny of observation.
"
"But O,--but O,--
"
"'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
"
"Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
"
"No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
[p]love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
"
"Almost I had.
"
"Negligent student! learn her by heart.
"
"By heart and in heart, boy.
"
"And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
"
"What wilt thou prove?
"
"A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
[p]the instant: by heart you love her, because your
[p]heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
[p]because your heart is in love with her; and out of
[p]heart you love her, being out of heart that you
[p]cannot enjoy her.
"
"I am all these three.
"
"And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
[p]all.
"
"Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
"
"A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
[p]for an ass.
"
"Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
"
"Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
[p]for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
"
"The way is but short: away!
"
"As swift as lead, sir.
"
"The meaning, pretty ingenious?
[p]Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
"
"Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
"
"I say lead is slow.
"
"You are too swift, sir, to say so:
[p]Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
"
"Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
[p]He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
[p]I shoot thee at the swain.
"
"Thump then and I flee.
"
"A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
[p]By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
[p]Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
[p]My herald is return'd.
"
"A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
"
"Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.
"
"No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
[p]mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
[p]l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
"
"By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
[p]thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
[p]me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
[p]Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
[p]the word l'envoy for a salve?
"
"Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
"
"No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
[p]Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
[p]I will example it:
[p]The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
[p]Were still at odds, being but three.
[p]There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
"
"I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
"
"The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
[p]Were still at odds, being but three.
"
"Until the goose came out of door,
[p]And stay'd the odds by adding four.
[p]Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
[p]my l'envoy.
[p]The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
[p]Were still at odds, being but three.
"
"Until the goose came out of door,
[p]Staying the odds by adding four.
"
"A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
[p]desire more?
"
"The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
[p]Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
[p]To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
[p]Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
"
"Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
"
"By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
[p]Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
"
"True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
[p]argument in;
[p]Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
[p]And he ended the market.
"
"But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
"
"I will tell you sensibly.
"
"Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
[p]I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
[p]Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
"
"We will talk no more of this matter.
"
"Till there be more matter in the shin.
"
"Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
"
"O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
[p]some goose, in this.
"
"By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
[p]enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
[p]restrained, captivated, bound.
"
"True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
"
"I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
[p]in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
[p]bear this significant
[p][Giving a letter]
[p]to the country maid Jaquenetta:
[p]there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
[p]honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.
"
"Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
"
"My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
[p][Exit MOTH]
[p]Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
[p]O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
[p]farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
[p]inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
[p]remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
[p]why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
[p]never buy and sell out of this word.
"
"O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.
"
"Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
[p]buy for a remuneration?
"
"What is a remuneration?
"
"Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
"
"Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
"
"I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
"
"Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
[p]As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
[p]Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
"
"When would you have it done, sir?
"
"This afternoon.
"
"Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.
"
"Thou knowest not what it is.
"
"I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
"
"Why, villain, thou must know first.
"
"I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
"
"It must be done this afternoon.
[p]Hark, slave, it is but this:
[p]The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
[p]And in her train there is a gentle lady;
[p]When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
[p]And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
[p]And to her white hand see thou do commend
[p]This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
"
"Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
[p]a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
[p]will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!
"
"And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;
[p]A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
[p]A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
[p]A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
[p]Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
[p]This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
[p]This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
[p]Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
[p]The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
[p]Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
[p]Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
[p]Sole imperator and great general
[p]Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
[p]And I to be a corporal of his field,
[p]And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
[p]What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
[p]A woman, that is like a German clock,
[p]Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
[p]And never going aright, being a watch,
[p]But being watch'd that it may still go right!
[p]Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
[p]And, among three, to love the worst of all;
[p]A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
[p]With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
[p]Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
[p]Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
[p]And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
[p]To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
[p]That Cupid will impose for my neglect
[p]Of his almighty dreadful little might.
[p]Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
[p]Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
"
"Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
[p]Against the steep uprising of the hill?
"
"I know not; but I think it was not he.
"
"Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
[p]Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
[p]On Saturday we will return to France.
[p]Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
[p]That we must stand and play the murderer in?
"
"Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
[p]A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
"
"I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
[p]And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
"
"Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
"
"What, what? first praise me and again say no?
[p]O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
"
"Yes, madam, fair.
"
"Nay, never paint me now:
[p]Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
[p]Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
[p]Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
"
"Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
"
"See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
[p]O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
[p]A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
[p]But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
[p]And shooting well is then accounted ill.
[p]Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
[p]Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
[p]If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
[p]That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
[p]And out of question so it is sometimes,
[p]Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
[p]When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
[p]We bend to that the working of the heart;
[p]As I for praise alone now seek to spill
[p]The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.
"
"Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
[p]Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
[p]Lords o'er their lords?
"
"Only for praise: and praise we may afford
[p]To any lady that subdues a lord.
"
"Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
"
"God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
"
"Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
"
"Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
"
"The thickest and the tallest.
"
"The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
[p]An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
[p]One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
[p]Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.
"
"What's your will, sir? what's your will?
"
"I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.
"
"O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
[p]Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
[p]Break up this capon.
"
"I am bound to serve.
[p]This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
[p]It is writ to Jaquenetta.
"
"We will read it, I swear.
[p]Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.
"
"'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
[p]true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
[p]thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
[p]than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
[p]commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
[p]magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
[p]eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
[p]Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
[p]Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
[p]vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
[p]came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
[p]overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
[p]come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
[p]whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
[p]beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
[p]conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
[p]The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
[p]beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
[p]side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
[p]both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
[p]thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
[p]Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
[p]thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
[p]will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
[p]for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
[p]expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
[p]my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
[p]part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
[p]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
[p]Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
[p]'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
[p]Submissive fall his princely feet before,
[p]And he from forage will incline to play:
[p]But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
[p]Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
"
"What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
[p]What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?
"
"I am much deceived but I remember the style.
"
"Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.
"
"This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
[p]A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
[p]To the prince and his bookmates.
"
"Thou fellow, a word:
[p]Who gave thee this letter?
"
"I told you; my lord.
"
"To whom shouldst thou give it?
"
"From my lord to my lady.
"
"From which lord to which lady?
"
"From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
[p]To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.
"
"Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
[p][To ROSALINE]
[p]Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.
"
"Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?
"
"Shall I teach you to know?
"
"Ay, my continent of beauty.
"
"Why, she that bears the bow.
[p]Finely put off!
"
"My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
[p]Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
[p]Finely put on!
"
"Well, then, I am the shooter.
"
"And who is your deer?
"
"If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
[p]Finely put on, indeed!
"
"You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
[p]at the brow.
"
"But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?
"
"Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
[p]a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
[p]touching the hit it?
"
"So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
[p]woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
[p]wench, as touching the hit it.
"
"Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
[p]Thou canst not hit it, my good man.
"
"An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
[p]An I cannot, another can.
"
"By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!
"
"A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.
"
"A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
[p]Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.
"
"Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.
"
"Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.
"
"An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
"
"Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
"
"Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
"
"She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.
"
"I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.
"
"By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
[p]Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
[p]O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
[p]vulgar wit!
[p]When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
[p]were, so fit.
[p]Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
[p]To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
[p]To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
[p]will swear!
[p]And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
[p]Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
[p]Sola, sola!
"
"Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
[p]of a good conscience.
"
"The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
[p]as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
[p]the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
[p]and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
[p]the soil, the land, the earth.
"
"Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
[p]varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
[p]assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.
"
"Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
"
"'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
"
"Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
[p]insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
[p]explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
[p]rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
[p]inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
[p]uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
[p]unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
[p]insert again my haud credo for a deer.
"
"I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.
"
"Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
[p]O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!
"
"Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
[p]in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
[p]hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
[p]replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
[p]the duller parts:
[p]And such barren plants are set before us, that we
[p]thankful should be,
[p]Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
[p]do fructify in us more than he.
[p]For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
[p]So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
[p]But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
[p]Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.
"
"You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
[p]What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
[p]weeks old as yet?
"
"Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
"
"What is Dictynna?
"
"A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
"
"The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
[p]And raught not to five weeks when he came to
[p]five-score.
[p]The allusion holds in the exchange.
"
"'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
"
"God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
[p]in the exchange.
"
"And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
[p]the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
[p]that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.
"
"Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
[p]on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
[p]ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.
"
"Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
[p]please you to abrogate scurrility.
"
"I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
[p]The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
[p]pleasing pricket;
[p]Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
[p]sore with shooting.
[p]The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
[p]from thicket;
[p]Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
[p]If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
[p]one sorel.
[p]Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.
"
"A rare talent!
"
"[Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
[p]him with a talent.
"
"This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
[p]foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
[p]shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
[p]revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
[p]memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
[p]delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
[p]gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
[p]thankful for it.
"
"Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
[p]parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
[p]you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
[p]you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.
"
"Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
[p]want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
[p]I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
[p]loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.
"
"God give you good morrow, master Parson.
"
"Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
[p]pierced, which is the one?
"
"Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.
"
"Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
[p]tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
[p]for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.
"
"Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
[p]letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
[p]from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.
"
"Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
[p]Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
[p]may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
[p]Venetia, Venetia,
[p]Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
[p]Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
[p]not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
[p]Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
[p]as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?
"
"Ay, sir, and very learned.
"
"Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.
"
"[Reads]
[p]If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
[p]Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
[p]Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:
[p]Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like
[p]osiers bow'd.
[p]Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
[p]Where all those pleasures live that art would
[p]comprehend:
[p]If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
[p]Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
[p]All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
[p]Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
[p]Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
[p]Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
[p]Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
[p]That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.
"
"You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
[p]accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
[p]only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
[p]facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
[p]Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
[p]but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
[p]fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
[p]so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
[p]the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
[p]was this directed to you?
"
"Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
[p]queen's lords.
"
"I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
[p]snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
[p]Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
[p]the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
[p]to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
[p]desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
[p]Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
[p]he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
[p]queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
[p]progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
[p]sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
[p]king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
[p]compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.
"
"Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
"
"Have with thee, my girl.
"
"Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
[p]religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--
"
"Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
[p]colours. But to return to the verses: did they
[p]please you, Sir Nathaniel?
"
"Marvellous well for the pen.
"
"I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
[p]of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please
[p]you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
[p]privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
[p]child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I
[p]will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
[p]neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
[p]beseech your society.
"
"And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
[p]the happiness of life.
"
"And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
[p][To DULL]
[p]Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
[p]say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
[p]their game, and we will to our recreation.
"
"The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
[p]myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
[p]a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
[p]word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
[p]the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
[p]proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
[p]Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
[p]well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
[p]I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
[p]eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
[p]love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
[p]in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
[p]heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
[p]and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
[p]and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
[p]sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
[p]it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
[p]fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care

[p]Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
[p]Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
[p]As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;
[p]Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:
[p]No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
[p]So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
[p]Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
[p]And they thy glory through my grief will show:

[p]Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
[p]Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
[p]Do not call it sin in me,
[p]That I am forsworn for thee;
[p]Thou for whom Jove would swear
[p]Juno but an Ethiope were;
[p]And deny himself for Jove,
[p]Turning mortal for thy love.
[p]This will I send, and something else more plain,
[p]That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
[p]O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
[p]Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
[p]Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
[p]For none offend where all alike do dote.
"
"[Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
[p]You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
[p]To be o'erheard and taken napping so.
"
"[Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
[p]You chide at him, offending twice as much;
[p]You do not love Maria; Longaville
[p]Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
[p]Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
[p]His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
[p]I have been closely shrouded in this bush
[p]And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
[p]I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
[p]Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
[p]Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
[p]One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
[p][To LONGAVILLE]
[p]You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
[p][To DUMAIN]
[p]And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
[p]What will Biron say when that he shall hear
[p]Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
[p]How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
[p]How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
[p]For all the wealth that ever I did see,
[p]I would not have him know so much by me.
"
"Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
[p][Advancing]
[p]Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
[p]Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
[p]These worms for loving, that art most in love?
[p]Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
[p]There is no certain princess that appears;
[p]You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
[p]Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
[p]But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
[p]All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
[p]You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
[p]But I a beam do find in each of three.
[p]O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
[p]Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
[p]O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
[p]To see a king transformed to a gnat!
[p]To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
[p]And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
[p]And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
[p]And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
[p]Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
[p]And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
[p]And where my liege's? all about the breast:
[p]A caudle, ho!
"
"Too bitter is thy jest.
[p]Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?
"
"Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
[p]I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
[p]To break the vow I am engaged in;
[p]I am betray'd, by keeping company
[p]With men like men of inconstancy.
[p]When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
[p]Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
[p]In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
[p]Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
[p]A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
[p]A leg, a limb?
"
"Soft! whither away so fast?
[p]A true man or a thief that gallops so?
"
"I post from love: good lover, let me go.
"
"God bless the king!
"
"What present hast thou there?
"
"Some certain treason.
"
"What makes treason here?
"
"Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
"
"If it mar nothing neither,
[p]The treason and you go in peace away together.
"
"I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
[p]Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.
"
"Biron, read it over.
[p][Giving him the paper]
[p]Where hadst thou it?
"
"Of Costard.
"
"Where hadst thou it?
"
"Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
"
"How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?
"
"A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.
"
"It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
"
"It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
"
"[To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
[p]born to do me shame.
[p]Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.
"
"What?
"
"That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
[p]He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
[p]Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
[p]O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.
"
"Now the number is even.
"
"True, true; we are four.
[p]Will these turtles be gone?
"
"Hence, sirs; away!
"
"Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
"
"Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
[p]As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
[p]The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
[p]Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
[p]We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
[p]Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.
"
"What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
"
"Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
[p]That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
[p]At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
[p]Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
[p]Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
[p]What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
[p]Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
[p]That is not blinded by her majesty?
"
"What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
[p]My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
[p]She an attending star, scarce seen a light.
"
"My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
[p]O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
[p]Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
[p]Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
[p]Where several worthies make one dignity,
[p]Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
[p]Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
[p]Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
[p]To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
[p]She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
[p]A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
[p]Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
[p]Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
[p]And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
[p]O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.
"
"By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
"
"Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
[p]A wife of such wood were felicity.
[p]O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
[p]That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
[p]If that she learn not of her eye to look:
[p]No face is fair that is not full so black.
"
"O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
[p]The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
[p]And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
"
"Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
[p]O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
[p]It mourns that painting and usurping hair
[p]Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
[p]And therefore is she born to make black fair.
[p]Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
[p]For native blood is counted painting now;
[p]And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
[p]Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
"
"To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
"
"And since her time are colliers counted bright.
"
"And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
"
"Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
"
"Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
[p]For fear their colours should be wash'd away.
"
"'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
[p]I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.
"
"I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
"
"No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
"
"I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
"
"Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
"
"O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
[p]Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
"
"O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
[p]The street should see as she walk'd overhead.
"
"But what of this? are we not all in love?
"
"Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
"
"Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
[p]Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.
"
"Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
"
"O, some authority how to proceed;
[p]Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.
"
"Some salve for perjury.
"
"'Tis more than need.
[p]Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
[p]Consider what you first did swear unto,
[p]To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
[p]Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
[p]Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
[p]And abstinence engenders maladies.
[p]And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
[p]In that each of you have forsworn his book,
[p]Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
[p]For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
[p]Have found the ground of study's excellence
[p]Without the beauty of a woman's face?
[p][From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;]
[p]They are the ground, the books, the academes
[p]From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire]
[p]Why, universal plodding poisons up
[p]The nimble spirits in the arteries,
[p]As motion and long-during action tires
[p]The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
[p]Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
[p]You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
[p]And study too, the causer of your vow;
[p]For where is any author in the world
[p]Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
[p]Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
[p]And where we are our learning likewise is:
[p]Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
[p]Do we not likewise see our learning there?
[p]O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
[p]And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
[p]For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
[p]In leaden contemplation have found out
[p]Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
[p]Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
[p]Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
[p]And therefore, finding barren practisers,
[p]Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
[p]But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
[p]Lives not alone immured in the brain;
[p]But, with the motion of all elements,
[p]Courses as swift as thought in every power,
[p]And gives to every power a double power,
[p]Above their functions and their offices.
[p]It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
[p]A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
[p]A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
[p]When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
[p]Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
[p]Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
[p]Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
[p]For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
[p]Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
[p]Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
[p]As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
[p]And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
[p]Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
[p]Never durst poet touch a pen to write
[p]Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
[p]O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
[p]And plant in tyrants mild humility.
[p]From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
[p]They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
[p]They are the books, the arts, the academes,
[p]That show, contain and nourish all the world:
[p]Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
[p]Then fools you were these women to forswear,
[p]Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
[p]For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
[p]Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
[p]Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
[p]Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
[p]Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
[p]Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
[p]It is religion to be thus forsworn,
[p]For charity itself fulfills the law,
[p]And who can sever love from charity?
"
"Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
"
"Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
[p]Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
[p]In conflict that you get the sun of them.
"
"Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
[p]Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
"
"And win them too: therefore let us devise
[p]Some entertainment for them in their tents.
"
"First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
[p]Then homeward every man attach the hand
[p]Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
[p]We will with some strange pastime solace them,
[p]Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
[p]For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
[p]Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.
"
"Away, away! no time shall be omitted
[p]That will betime, and may by us be fitted.
"
"Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
[p]And justice always whirls in equal measure:
[p]Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
[p]If so, our copper buys no better treasure.
"
"Satis quod sufficit.
"
"I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
[p]have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
[p]scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
[p]impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
[p]out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
[p]a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
[p]nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.
"
"Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
[p]discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
[p]ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
[p]behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
[p]too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
[p]were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.
"
"A most singular and choice epithet.
"
"He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
[p]than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
[p]fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
[p]point-devise companions; such rackers of
[p]orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
[p]say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
[p]e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
[p]half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
[p]abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
[p]would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
[p]insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.
"
"Laus Deo, bene intelligo.
"
"Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
[p]'twill serve.
"
"Videsne quis venit?
"
"Video, et gaudeo.
"
"Chirrah!
"
"Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
"
"Men of peace, well encountered.
"
"Most military sir, salutation.
"
"[Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast
[p]of languages, and stolen the scraps.
"
"O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
[p]I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
[p]for thou art not so long by the head as
[p]honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
[p]swallowed than a flap-dragon.
"
"Peace! the peal begins.
"
"[To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lettered?
"
"Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
[p]b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?
"
"Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
"
"Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
"
"Quis, quis, thou consonant?
"
"The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
[p]the fifth, if I.
"
"I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--
"
"The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
"
"Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
[p]touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
[p]home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!
"
"Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.
"
"What is the figure? what is the figure?
"
"Horns.
"
"Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.
"
"Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
[p]your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.
"
"An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
[p]have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
[p]remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
[p]purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
[p]the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
[p]bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
[p]Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
[p]ends, as they say.
"
"O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
"
"Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
[p]barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
[p]charge-house on the top of the mountain?
"
"Or mons, the hill.
"
"At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
"
"I do, sans question.
"
"Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
[p]affection to congratulate the princess at her
[p]pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
[p]rude multitude call the afternoon.
"
"The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
[p]liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
[p]the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
[p]assure you, sir, I do assure.
"
"Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
[p]I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
[p]inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
[p]remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
[p]head: and among other important and most serious
[p]designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
[p]that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
[p]grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
[p]shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
[p]with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
[p]heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
[p]fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
[p]greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
[p]travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
[p]The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
[p]implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
[p]present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
[p]delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
[p]antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
[p]curate and your sweet self are good at such
[p]eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
[p]were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
[p]crave your assistance.
"
"Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
[p]Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
[p]show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
[p]our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
[p]gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
[p]the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
[p]Nine Worthies.
"
"Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
"
"Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
[p]Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
[p]limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
[p]page, Hercules,--
"
"Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
[p]that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.
"
"Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
[p]minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
[p]snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.
"
"An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
[p]hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
[p]crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
[p]offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
"
"For the rest of the Worthies?--
"
"I will play three myself.
"
"Thrice-worthy gentleman!
"
"Shall I tell you a thing?
"
"We attend.
"
"We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
[p]beseech you, follow.
"
"Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.
"
"Nor understood none neither, sir.
"
"Allons! we will employ thee.
"
"I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
[p]On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.
"
"Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!
"
"Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
[p]If fairings come thus plentifully in:
[p]A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
[p]Look you what I have from the loving king.
"
"Madame, came nothing else along with that?
"
"Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
[p]As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
[p]Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
[p]That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.
"
"That was the way to make his godhead wax,
[p]For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
"
"Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
"
"You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.
"
"He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
[p]And so she died: had she been light, like you,
[p]Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
[p]She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
[p]And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
"
"What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
"
"A light condition in a beauty dark.
"
"We need more light to find your meaning out.
"
"You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
[p]Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
"
"Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
"
"So do not you, for you are a light wench.
"
"Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.
"
"You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
"
"Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
"
"Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
[p]But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
[p]Who sent it? and what is it?
"
"I would you knew:
[p]An if my face were but as fair as yours,
[p]My favour were as great; be witness this.
[p]Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
[p]The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
[p]I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
[p]I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
[p]O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!
"
"Any thing like?
"
"Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
"
"Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
"
"Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
"
"'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
[p]My red dominical, my golden letter:
[p]O, that your face were not so full of O's!
"
"A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
"
"But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
"
"Madam, this glove.
"
"Did he not send you twain?
"
"Yes, madam, and moreover
[p]Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
[p]A huge translation of hypocrisy,
[p]Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
"
"This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
[p]The letter is too long by half a mile.
"
"I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
[p]The chain were longer and the letter short?
"
"Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
"
"We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
"
"They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
[p]That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
[p]O that I knew he were but in by the week!
[p]How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
[p]And wait the season and observe the times
[p]And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
[p]And shape his service wholly to my hests
[p]And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
[p]So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
[p]That he should be my fool and I his fate.
"
"None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
[p]As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
[p]Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
[p]And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
"
"The blood of youth burns not with such excess
[p]As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
"
"Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
[p]As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
[p]Since all the power thereof it doth apply
[p]To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
"
"Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
"
"O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?
"
"Thy news Boyet?
"
"Prepare, madam, prepare!
[p]Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
[p]Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
[p]Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
[p]Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
[p]Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
"
"Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
[p]That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.
"
"Under the cool shade of a sycamore
[p]I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
[p]When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
[p]Toward that shade I might behold addrest
[p]The king and his companions: warily
[p]I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
[p]And overheard what you shall overhear,
[p]That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
[p]Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
[p]That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
[p]Action and accent did they teach him there;
[p]'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
[p]And ever and anon they made a doubt
[p]Presence majestical would put him out,
[p]'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
[p]Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
[p]The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
[p]I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
[p]With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
[p]Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
[p]One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
[p]A better speech was never spoke before;
[p]Another, with his finger and his thumb,
[p]Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
[p]The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
[p]The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
[p]With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
[p]With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
[p]That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
[p]To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.
"
"But what, but what, come they to visit us?
"
"They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
[p]Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
[p]Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
[p]And every one his love-feat will advance
[p]Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
[p]By favours several which they did bestow.
"
"And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
[p]For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
[p]And not a man of them shall have the grace,
[p]Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
[p]Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
[p]And then the king will court thee for his dear;
[p]Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
[p]So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
[p]And change your favours too; so shall your loves
[p]Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.
"
"Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.
"
"But in this changing what is your intent?
"
"The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
[p]They do it but in mocking merriment;
[p]And mock for mock is only my intent.
[p]Their several counsels they unbosom shall
[p]To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
[p]Upon the next occasion that we meet,
[p]With visages displayed, to talk and greet.
"
"But shall we dance, if they desire to't?
"
"No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
[p]Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
[p]But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
"
"Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
[p]And quite divorce his memory from his part.
"
"Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
[p]The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
[p]There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
[p]To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
[p]So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
[p]And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
"
"The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
[p][The Ladies mask]
[p][Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND,]
[p]BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits,
[p]and masked]
"
"All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--
"
"Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
"
"A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
[p][The Ladies turn their backs to him]
[p]That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!
"
"[Aside to MOTH] Their eyes, villain, their eyes!
"
"That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--
"
"True; out indeed.
"
"Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
[p]Not to behold--
"
"[Aside to MOTH] Once to behold, rogue.
"
"Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
[p]--with your sun-beamed eyes--
"
"They will not answer to that epithet;
[p]You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'
"
"They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
"
"Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
"
"What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
[p]If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
[p]That some plain man recount their purposes
[p]Know what they would.
"
"What would you with the princess?
"
"Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
"
"What would they, say they?
"
"Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
"
"Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
"
"She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
"
"Say to her, we have measured many miles
[p]To tread a measure with her on this grass.
"
"They say, that they have measured many a mile
[p]To tread a measure with you on this grass.
"
"It is not so. Ask them how many inches
[p]Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
[p]The measure then of one is easily told.
"
"If to come hither you have measured miles,
[p]And many miles, the princess bids you tell
[p]How many inches doth fill up one mile.
"
"Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.
"
"She hears herself.
"
"How many weary steps,
[p]Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
[p]Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
"
"We number nothing that we spend for you:
[p]Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
[p]That we may do it still without accompt.
[p]Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
[p]That we, like savages, may worship it.
"
"My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
"
"Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
[p]Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
[p]Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.
"
"O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
[p]Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.
"
"Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
[p]Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
"
"Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
[p][Music plays]
[p]Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
"
"Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
"
"You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
"
"Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
[p]The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
"
"Our ears vouchsafe it.
"
"But your legs should do it.
"
"Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
[p]We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.
"
"Why take we hands, then?
"
"Only to part friends:
[p]Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
"
"More measure of this measure; be not nice.
"
"We can afford no more at such a price.
"
"Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
"
"Your absence only.
"
"That can never be.
"
"Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
[p]Twice to your visor, and half once to you.
"
"If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
"
"In private, then.
"
"I am best pleased with that.
"
"White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
"
"Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
"
"Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
[p]Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
[p]There's half-a-dozen sweets.
"
"Seventh sweet, adieu:
[p]Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.
"
"One word in secret.
"
"Let it not be sweet.
"
"Thou grievest my gall.
"
"Gall! bitter.
"
"Therefore meet.
"
"Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
"
"Name it.
"
"Fair lady,--
"
"Say you so? Fair lord,--
[p]Take that for your fair lady.
"
"Please it you,
[p]As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
"
"What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
"
"I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
"
"O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
"
"You have a double tongue within your mask,
[p]And would afford my speechless vizard half.
"
"Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
"
"A calf, fair lady!
"
"No, a fair lord calf.
"
"Let's part the word.
"
"No, I'll not be your half
[p]Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
"
"Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
[p]Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.
"
"Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
"
"One word in private with you, ere I die.
"
"Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
"
"The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
[p]As is the razor's edge invisible,
[p]Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
[p]Above the sense of sense; so sensible
[p]Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
[p]Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.
"
"Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
"
"By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
"
"Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
"
"Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
[p][Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors]
[p]Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?
"
"Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
"
"Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
"
"O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
[p]Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
[p]Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
[p]This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
"
"O, they were all in lamentable cases!
[p]The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
"
"Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
"
"Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
[p]No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
"
"Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
[p]And trow you what he called me?
"
"Qualm, perhaps.
"
"Yes, in good faith.
"
"Go, sickness as thou art!
"
"Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
[p]But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
"
"And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.
"
"And Longaville was for my service born.
"
"Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
"
"Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
[p]Immediately they will again be here
[p]In their own shapes; for it can never be
[p]They will digest this harsh indignity.
"
"Will they return?
"
"They will, they will, God knows,
[p]And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
[p]Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
[p]Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.
"
"How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
"
"Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
[p]Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
[p]Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.
"
"Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
[p]If they return in their own shapes to woo?
"
"Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
[p]Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
[p]Let us complain to them what fools were here,
[p]Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
[p]And wonder what they were and to what end
[p]Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
[p]And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
[p]Should be presented at our tent to us.
"
"Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
"
"Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
[p][Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA]
[p][Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN,]
[p]in their proper habits]
"
"Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?
"
"Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
[p]Command me any service to her thither?
"
"That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
"
"I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
"
"This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
[p]And utters it again when God doth please:
[p]He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
[p]At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
[p]And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
[p]Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
[p]This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
[p]Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
[p]A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
[p]That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
[p]This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
[p]That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
[p]In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
[p]A mean most meanly; and in ushering
[p]Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
[p]The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
[p]This is the flower that smiles on every one,
[p]To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
[p]And consciences, that will not die in debt,
[p]Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.
"
"A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
[p]That put Armado's page out of his part!
"
"See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
[p]Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?
[p][Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE,]
[p]MARIA, and KATHARINE]
"
"All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
"
"'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
"
"Construe my speeches better, if you may.
"
"Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
"
"We came to visit you, and purpose now
[p]To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.
"
"This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
[p]Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
"
"Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
[p]The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
"
"You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
[p]For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
[p]Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
[p]As the unsullied lily, I protest,
[p]A world of torments though I should endure,
[p]I would not yield to be your house's guest;
[p]So much I hate a breaking cause to be
[p]Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.
"
"O, you have lived in desolation here,
[p]Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
"
"Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
[p]We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
[p]A mess of Russians left us but of late.
"
"How, madam! Russians!
"
"Ay, in truth, my lord;
[p]Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
"
"Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
[p]My lady, to the manner of the days,
[p]In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
[p]We four indeed confronted were with four
[p]In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
[p]And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
[p]They did not bless us with one happy word.
[p]I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
[p]When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
"
"This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
[p]Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
[p]With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
[p]By light we lose light: your capacity
[p]Is of that nature that to your huge store
[p]Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
"
"This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--
"
"I am a fool, and full of poverty.
"
"But that you take what doth to you belong,
[p]It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
"
"O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
"
"All the fool mine?
"
"I cannot give you less.
"
"Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
"
"Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
"
"There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
[p]That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
"
"We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.
"
"Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
"
"Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
"
"Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
[p]Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
"
"Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
[p]Can any face of brass hold longer out?
[p]Here stand I. lady, dart thy skill at me;
[p]Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
[p]Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
[p]Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
[p]And I will wish thee never more to dance,
[p]Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
[p]O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
[p]Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
[p]Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
[p]Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
[p]Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
[p]Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
[p]Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
[p]Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
[p]I do forswear them; and I here protest,
[p]By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
[p]Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
[p]In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
[p]And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
[p]My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
"
"Sans sans, I pray you.
"
"Yet I have a trick
[p]Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
[p]I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
[p]Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
[p]They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
[p]They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
[p]These lords are visited; you are not free,
[p]For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
"
"No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
"
"Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
"
"It is not so; for how can this be true,
[p]That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
"
"Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
"
"Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
"
"Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
"
"Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
[p]Some fair excuse.
"
"The fairest is confession.
[p]Were not you here but even now disguised?
"
"Madam, I was.
"
"And were you well advised?
"
"I was, fair madam.
"
"When you then were here,
[p]What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
"
"That more than all the world I did respect her.
"
"When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
"
"Upon mine honour, no.
"
"Peace, peace! forbear:
[p]Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
"
"Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
"
"I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
[p]What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
"
"Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
[p]As precious eyesight, and did value me
[p]Above this world; adding thereto moreover
[p]That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
"
"God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
[p]Most honourably doth unhold his word.
"
"What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
[p]I never swore this lady such an oath.
"
"By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
[p]You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
"
"My faith and this the princess I did give:
[p]I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
"
"Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
[p]And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
[p]What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
"
"Neither of either; I remit both twain.
[p]I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
[p]Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
[p]To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
[p]Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
[p]Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
[p]That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
[p]To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
[p]Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
[p]The ladies did change favours: and then we,
[p]Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
[p]Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
[p]We are again forsworn, in will and error.
[p]Much upon this it is: and might not you
[p][To BOYET]
[p]Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
[p]Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
[p]And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
[p]And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
[p]Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
[p]You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
[p]Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
[p]You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
[p]Wounds like a leaden sword.
"
"Full merrily
[p]Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
"
"Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
[p][Enter COSTARD]
[p]Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.
"
"O Lord, sir, they would know
[p]Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
"
"What, are there but three?
"
"No, sir; but it is vara fine,
[p]For every one pursents three.
"
"And three times thrice is nine.
"
"Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
[p]You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
[p]what we know:
[p]I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--
"
"Is not nine.
"
"Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
"
"By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
"
"O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
[p]by reckoning, sir.
"
"How much is it?
"
"O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
[p]sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
[p]own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
[p]in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
"
"Art thou one of the Worthies?
"
"It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
[p]Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
[p]the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
"
"Go, bid them prepare.
"
"We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
[p]some care.
"
"Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.
"
"We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
[p]To have one show worse than the king's and his company.
"
"I say they shall not come.
"
"Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
[p]That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
[p]Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
[p]Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
[p]Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
[p]When great things labouring perish in their birth.
"
"A right description of our sport, my lord.
"
"Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
[p]sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.
"
"Doth this man serve God?
"
"Why ask you?
"
"He speaks not like a man of God's making.
"
"That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
[p]I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
[p]fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
[p]will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
[p]I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!
"
"Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
[p]presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the
[p]Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,
[p]Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
[p]these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
[p]These four will change habits, and present the other five.
"
"There is five in the first show.
"
"You are deceived; 'tis not so.
"
"The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
[p]and the boy:--
[p]Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
[p]Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.
"
"The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
"
"I Pompey am,--
"
"You lie, you are not he.
"
"I Pompey am,--
"
"With libbard's head on knee.
"
"Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
[p]with thee.
"
"I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--
"
"The Great.
"
"It is, 'Great,' sir:--
[p]Pompey surnamed the Great;
[p]That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
[p]my foe to sweat:
[p]And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
[p]And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
[p]If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.
"
"Great thanks, great Pompey.
"
"'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
[p]made a little fault in 'Great.'
"
"My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
"
"When in the world I lived, I was the world's
[p]commander;
[p]By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
[p]conquering might:
[p]My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--
"
"Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.
"
"Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.
"
"The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.
"
"When in the world I lived, I was the world's
[p]commander,--
"
"Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.
"
"Pompey the Great,--
"
"Your servant, and Costard.
"
"Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.
"
"[To SIR NATHANIEL] O, sir, you have overthrown
[p]Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of
[p]the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds
[p]his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given
[p]to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,
[p]and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.
[p][SIR NATHANIEL retires]
[p]There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an
[p]honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a
[p]marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good
[p]bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how
[p]'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies
[p]a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.
"
"Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
[p]Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;
[p]And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
[p]Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
[p]Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
[p]Ergo I come with this apology.
[p]Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.
[p][MOTH retires]
[p]Judas I am,--
"
"A Judas!
"
"Not Iscariot, sir.
[p]Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.
"
"Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
"
"A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?
"
"Judas I am,--
"
"The more shame for you, Judas.
"
"What mean you, sir?
"
"To make Judas hang himself.
"
"Begin, sir; you are my elder.
"
"Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
"
"I will not be put out of countenance.
"
"Because thou hast no face.
"
"What is this?
"
"A cittern-head.
"
"The head of a bodkin.
"
"A Death's face in a ring.
"
"The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.
"
"The pommel of Caesar's falchion.
"
"The carved-bone face on a flask.
"
"Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.
"
"Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
"
"Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
[p]And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.
"
"You have put me out of countenance.
"
"False; we have given thee faces.
"
"But you have out-faced them all.
"
"An thou wert a lion, we would do so.
"
"Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
[p]And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?
"
"For the latter end of his name.
"
"For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!
"
"This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
"
"A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.
"
"Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
"
"Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.
"
"Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
"
"Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
"
"But is this Hector?
"
"I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.
"
"His leg is too big for Hector's.
"
"More calf, certain.
"
"No; he is best endued in the small.
"
"This cannot be Hector.
"
"He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
"
"The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
[p]Gave Hector a gift,--
"
"A gilt nutmeg.
"
"A lemon.
"
"Stuck with cloves.
"
"No, cloven.
"
"Peace!--
[p]The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
[p]Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
[p]A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
[p]From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
[p]I am that flower,--
"
"That mint.
"
"That columbine.
"
"Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
"
"I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.
"
"Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
"
"The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
[p]beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
[p]he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
[p][To the PRINCESS]
[p]Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.
"
"Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
"
"I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.
"
"[Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot,--
"
"[Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.
"
"This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--
"
"The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
[p]is two months on her way.
"
"What meanest thou?
"
"Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
[p]wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
[p]her belly already: tis yours.
"
"Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
[p]die.
"
"Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
[p]quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
[p]him.
"
"Most rare Pompey!
"
"Renowned Pompey!
"
"Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
[p]Pompey the Huge!
"
"Hector trembles.
"
"Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
[p]on! stir them on!
"
"Hector will challenge him.
"
"Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
[p]sup a flea.
"
"By the north pole, I do challenge thee.
"
"I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
[p]I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
[p]let me borrow my arms again.
"
"Room for the incensed Worthies!
"
"I'll do it in my shirt.
"
"Most resolute Pompey!
"
"Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
[p]not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
[p]you? You will lose your reputation.
"
"Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
[p]in my shirt.
"
"You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
"
"Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
"
"What reason have you for't?
"
"The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
[p]woolward for penance.
"
"True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
[p]linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
[p]a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
[p]his heart for a favour.
"
"God save you, madam!
"
"Welcome, Mercade;
[p]But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
"
"I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
[p]Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--
"
"Dead, for my life!
"
"Even so; my tale is told.
"
"Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
"
"For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
[p]seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
[p]discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.
"
"How fares your majesty?
"
"Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.
"
"Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.
"
"Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
[p]For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
[p]Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
[p]In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
[p]The liberal opposition of our spirits,
[p]If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
[p]In the converse of breath: your gentleness
[p]Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
[p]A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
[p]Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
[p]For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
"
"The extreme parts of time extremely forms
[p]All causes to the purpose of his speed,
[p]And often at his very loose decides
[p]That which long process could not arbitrate:
[p]And though the mourning brow of progeny
[p]Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
[p]The holy suit which fain it would convince,
[p]Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
[p]Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
[p]From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
[p]Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
[p]As to rejoice at friends but newly found.PRINCESS. I understand you not: my griefs are double.
"
"Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
[p]And by these badges understand the king.
[p]For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
[p]Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
[p]Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
[p]Even to the opposed end of our intents:
[p]And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
[p]As love is full of unbefitting strains,
[p]All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
[p]Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
[p]Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
[p]Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
[p]To every varied object in his glance:
[p]Which parti-coated presence of loose love
[p]Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
[p]Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
[p]Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
[p]Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
[p]Our love being yours, the error that love makes
[p]Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
[p]By being once false for ever to be true
[p]To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
[p]And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
[p]Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
"
"We have received your letters full of love;
[p]Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
[p]And, in our maiden council, rated them
[p]At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
[p]As bombast and as lining to the time:
[p]But more devout than this in our respects
[p]Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
[p]In their own fashion, like a merriment.
"
"Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
"
"So did our looks.
"
"We did not quote them so.
"
"Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
[p]Grant us your loves.
"
"A time, methinks, too short
[p]To make a world-without-end bargain in.
[p]No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
[p]Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
[p]If for my love, as there is no such cause,
[p]You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
[p]Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
[p]To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
[p]Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
[p]There stay until the twelve celestial signs
[p]Have brought about the annual reckoning.
[p]If this austere insociable life
[p]Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
[p]If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
[p]Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
[p]But that it bear this trial and last love;
[p]Then, at the expiration of the year,
[p]Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
[p]And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
[p]I will be thine; and till that instant shut
[p]My woeful self up in a mourning house,
[p]Raining the tears of lamentation
[p]For the remembrance of my father's death.
[p]If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
[p]Neither entitled in the other's heart.
"
"If this, or more than this, I would deny,
[p]To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
[p]The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
[p]Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
"
"[And what to me, my love? and what to me?
"
"You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd,
[p]You are attaint with faults and perjury:
[p]Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
[p]A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
[p]But seek the weary beds of people sick]
"
"But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?
"
"A beard, fair health, and honesty;
[p]With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
"
"O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
"
"Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
[p]I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
[p]Come when the king doth to my lady come;
[p]Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
"
"I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
"
"Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
"
"What says Maria?
"
"At the twelvemonth's end
[p]I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
"
"I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
"
"The liker you; few taller are so young.
"
"Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
[p]Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
[p]What humble suit attends thy answer there:
[p]Impose some service on me for thy love.
"
"Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
[p]Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
[p]Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
[p]Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
[p]Which you on all estates will execute
[p]That lie within the mercy of your wit.
[p]To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
[p]And therewithal to win me, if you please,
[p]Without the which I am not to be won,
[p]You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
[p]Visit the speechless sick and still converse
[p]With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
[p]With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
[p]To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
"
"To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
[p]It cannot be; it is impossible:
[p]Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
"
"Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
[p]Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
[p]Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
[p]A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
[p]Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
[p]Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
[p]Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
[p]Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
[p]And I will have you and that fault withal;
[p]But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
[p]And I shall find you empty of that fault,
[p]Right joyful of your reformation.
"
"A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
[p]I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
"
"[To FERDINAND] Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.
"
"No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
"
"Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
[p]Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
[p]Might well have made our sport a comedy.
"
"Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
[p]And then 'twill end.
"
"That's too long for a play.
"
"Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--
"
"Was not that Hector?
"
"The worthy knight of Troy.
"
"I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
[p]a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
[p]plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
[p]esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
[p]the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
[p]owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
[p]end of our show.
"
"Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
"
"Holla! approach.
[p][Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD,]
[p]and others]
[p]This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
[p]the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
[p]cuckoo. Ver, begin.
[p][THE SONG]
[p]SPRING.
[p]When daisies pied and violets blue
[p]And lady-smocks all silver-white
[p]And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
[p]Do paint the meadows with delight,
[p]The cuckoo then, on every tree,
[p]Mocks married men; for thus sings he, . Cuckoo;
[p]Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
[p]Unpleasing to a married ear!
[p]When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
[p]And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
[p]When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
[p]And maidens bleach their summer smocks
[p]The cuckoo then, on every tree,
[p]Mocks married men; for thus sings he, . Cuckoo;
[p]Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
[p]Unpleasing to a married ear!
[p]WINTER.
[p]When icicles hang by the wall
[p]And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
[p]And Tom bears logs into the hall
[p]And milk comes frozen home in pail,
[p]When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
[p]Then nightly sings the staring owl, . Tu-whit;
[p]Tu-who, a merry note,
[p]While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
[p]When all aloud the wind doth blow
[p]And coughing drowns the parson's saw
[p]And birds sit brooding in the snow
[p]And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
[p]When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
[p]Then nightly sings the staring owl, . Tu-whit;
[p]Tu-who, a merry note,
[p]While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
"
"The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of
[p]Apollo. You that way: we this way.
"
"Escalus.
"
"My lord.
"
"Of government the properties to unfold,
[p]Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
[p]Since I am put to know that your own science
[p]Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
[p]My strength can give you: then no more remains,
[p]But that to your sufficiency [--]
[p][--] as your Worth is able,]
[p]And let them work. The nature of our people,
[p]Our city's institutions, and the terms
[p]For common justice, you're as pregnant in
[p]As art and practise hath enriched any
[p]That we remember. There is our commission,
[p]From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
[p]I say, bid come before us Angelo.
[p][Exit an Attendant]
[p]What figure of us Think you he will bear?
[p]For you must know, we have with special soul
[p]Elected him our absence to supply,
[p]Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
[p]And given his deputation all the organs
[p]Of our own power: what think you of it?
"
"If any in Vienna be of worth
[p]To undergo such ample grace and honour,
[p]It is Lord Angelo.
"
"Look where he comes.
"
"Always obedient to your grace's will,
[p]I come to know your pleasure.
"
"Angelo,
[p]There is a kind of character in thy life,
[p]That to the observer doth thy history
[p]Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
[p]Are not thine own so proper as to waste
[p]Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
[p]Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
[p]Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
[p]Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
[p]As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
[p]But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
[p]The smallest scruple of her excellence
[p]But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
[p]Herself the glory of a creditor,
[p]Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
[p]To one that can my part in him advertise;
[p]Hold therefore, Angelo:--
[p]In our remove be thou at full ourself;
[p]Mortality and mercy in Vienna
[p]Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
[p]Though first in question, is thy secondary.
[p]Take thy commission.
"
"Now, good my lord,
[p]Let there be some more test made of my metal,
[p]Before so noble and so great a figure
[p]Be stamp'd upon it.
"
"No more evasion:
[p]We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
[p]Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
[p]Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
[p]That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
[p]Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
[p]As time and our concernings shall importune,
[p]How it goes with us, and do look to know
[p]What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
[p]To the hopeful execution do I leave you
[p]Of your commissions.
"
"Yet give leave, my lord,
[p]That we may bring you something on the way.
"
"My haste may not admit it;
[p]Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
[p]With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
[p]So to enforce or qualify the laws
[p]As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
[p]I'll privily away. I love the people,
[p]But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
[p]Through it do well, I do not relish well
[p]Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
[p]Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
[p]That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
"
"The heavens give safety to your purposes!
"
"Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
"
"I thank you. Fare you well.
"
"I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
[p]To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
[p]To look into the bottom of my place:
[p]A power I have, but of what strength and nature
[p]I am not yet instructed.
"
"'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
[p]And we may soon our satisfaction have
[p]Touching that point.
"
"I'll wait upon your honour.
"
"If the duke with the other dukes come not to
[p]composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
[p]the dukes fall upon the king.
"
"Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
[p]Hungary's!
"
"Amen.
"
"Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
[p]went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
[p]one out of the table.
"
"'Thou shalt not steal'?
"
"Ay, that he razed.
"
"Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
[p]all the rest from their functions: they put forth
[p]to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
[p]the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
[p]well that prays for peace.
"
"I never heard any soldier dislike it.
"
"I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
[p]grace was said.
"
"No? a dozen times at least.
"
"What, in metre?
"
"In any proportion or in any language.
"
"I think, or in any religion.
"
"Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
[p]controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
[p]wicked villain, despite of all grace.
"
"Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
"
"I grant; as there may between the lists and the
[p]velvet. Thou art the list.
"
"And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
[p]a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
[p]be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
[p]art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
[p]feelingly now?
"
"I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
[p]feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
[p]confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
[p]live, forget to drink after thee.
"
"I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
"
"Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.
"
"Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
[p]have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--
"
"To what, I pray?
"
"Judge.
"
"To three thousand dolours a year.
"
"Ay, and more.
"
"A French crown more.
"
"Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
[p]art full of error; I am sound.
"
"Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
[p]things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
[p]impiety has made a feast of thee.
"
"How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
"
"Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
[p]to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
"
"Who's that, I pray thee?
"
"Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
"
"Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
"
"Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
[p]him carried away; and, which is more, within these
[p]three days his head to be chopped off.
"
"But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
[p]Art thou sure of this?
"
"I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
[p]Julietta with child.
"
"Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
[p]hours since, and he was ever precise in
[p]promise-keeping.
"
"Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
[p]speech we had to such a purpose.
"
"But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
"
"Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
"
"Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
[p]with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
[p]custom-shrunk.
[p][Enter POMPEY]
[p]How now! what's the news with you?

"Yonder man is carried to prison.
"
"Well; what has he done?
"
"A woman.
"
"But what's his offence?
"
"Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
"
"What, is there a maid with child by him?
"
"No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
[p]not heard of the proclamation, have you?
"
"What proclamation, man?
"
"All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
"
"And what shall become of those in the city?
"
"They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
[p]but that a wise burgher put in for them.
"
"But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
[p]pulled down?
"
"To the ground, mistress.
"
"Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
[p]What shall become of me?
"
"Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
[p]clients: though you change your place, you need not
[p]change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
[p]Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
[p]have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
[p]will be considered.
"
"What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.
"
"Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
[p]prison; and there's Madam Juliet.
"
"Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
[p]Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
"
"I do it not in evil disposition,
[p]But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
"
"Thus can the demigod Authority
[p]Make us pay down for our offence by weight
[p]The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
[p]On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
"
"Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
"
"From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
[p]As surfeit is the father of much fast,
[p]So every scope by the immoderate use
[p]Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
[p]Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
[p]A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
"
"If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
[p]send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
[p]the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
[p]as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
[p]offence, Claudio?
"
"What but to speak of would offend again.
"
"What, is't murder?
"
"No.
"
"Lechery?
"
"Call it so.
"
"Away, sir! you must go.
"
"One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
"
"A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
[p]Is lechery so look'd after?
"
"Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
[p]I got possession of Julietta's bed:
[p]You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
[p]Save that we do the denunciation lack
[p]Of outward order: this we came not to,
[p]Only for propagation of a dower
[p]Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
[p]From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
[p]Till time had made them for us. But it chances
[p]The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
[p]With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
"
"With child, perhaps?
"
"Unhappily, even so.
[p]And the new deputy now for the duke--
[p]Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
[p]Or whether that the body public be
[p]A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
[p]Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
[p]He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
[p]Whether the tyranny be in his place,
[p]Or in his emmence that fills it up,
[p]I stagger in:--but this new governor
[p]Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
[p]Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
[p]So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
[p]And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
[p]Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
[p]Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
"
"I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
[p]thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
[p]may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
[p]him.
"
"I have done so, but he's not to be found.
[p]I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
[p]This day my sister should the cloister enter
[p]And there receive her approbation:
[p]Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
[p]Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
[p]To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
[p]I have great hope in that; for in her youth
[p]There is a prone and speechless dialect,
[p]Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
[p]When she will play with reason and discourse,
[p]And well she can persuade.
"
"I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
[p]like, which else would stand under grievous
[p]imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
[p]would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
[p]game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
"
"I thank you, good friend Lucio.
"
"Within two hours.
"
"Come, officer, away!
"
"No, holy father; throw away that thought;
[p]Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
[p]Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
[p]To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
[p]More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
[p]Of burning youth.
"
"May your grace speak of it?
"
"My holy sir, none better knows than you
[p]How I have ever loved the life removed
[p]And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
[p]Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
[p]I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
[p]A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
[p]My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
[p]And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
[p]For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
[p]And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
[p]You will demand of me why I do this?
"
"Gladly, my lord.
"
"We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
[p]The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
[p]Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
[p]Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
[p]That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
[p]Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
[p]Only to stick it in their children's sight
[p]For terror, not to use, in time the rod
[p]Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
[p]Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
[p]And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
[p]The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
[p]Goes all decorum.
"
"It rested in your grace
[p]To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
[p]And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
[p]Than in Lord Angelo.
"
"I do fear, too dreadful:
[p]Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
[p]'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
[p]For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
[p]When evil deeds have their permissive pass
[p]And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
[p]I have on Angelo imposed the office;
[p]Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
[p]And yet my nature never in the fight
[p]To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
[p]I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
[p]Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
[p]Supply me with the habit and instruct me
[p]How I may formally in person bear me
[p]Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
[p]At our more leisure shall I render you;
[p]Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
[p]Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
[p]That his blood flows, or that his appetite
[p]Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
[p]If power change purpose, what our seemers be.
"
"And have you nuns no farther privileges?
"
"Are not these large enough?
"
"Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
[p]But rather wishing a more strict restraint
[p]Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.
"
"[Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!
"
"Who's that which calls?
"
"It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
[p]Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
[p]You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
[p]When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
[p]But in the presence of the prioress:
[p]Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
[p]Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
[p]He calls again; I pray you, answer him.
"
"Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
"
"Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
[p]Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
[p]As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
[p]A novice of this place and the fair sister
[p]To her unhappy brother Claudio?
"
"Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
[p]The rather for I now must make you know
[p]I am that Isabella and his sister.
"
"Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
[p]Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
"
"Woe me! for what?
"
"For that which, if myself might be his judge,
[p]He should receive his punishment in thanks:
[p]He hath got his friend with child.
"
"Sir, make me not your story.
"
"It is true.
[p]I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
[p]With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
[p]Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
[p]I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
[p]By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
[p]And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
[p]As with a saint.
"
"You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
"
"Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
[p]Your brother and his lover have embraced:
[p]As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
[p]That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
[p]To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
[p]Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
"
"Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
"
"Is she your cousin?
"
"Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
[p]By vain though apt affection.
"
"She it is.
"
"O, let him marry her.
"
"This is the point.
[p]The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
[p]Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
[p]In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
[p]By those that know the very nerves of state,
[p]His givings-out were of an infinite distance
[p]From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
[p]And with full line of his authority,
[p]Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
[p]Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
[p]The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
[p]But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
[p]With profits of the mind, study and fast.
[p]He--to give fear to use and liberty,
[p]Which have for long run by the hideous law,
[p]As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
[p]Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
[p]Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
[p]And follows close the rigour of the statute,
[p]To make him an example. All hope is gone,
[p]Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
[p]To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
[p]'Twixt you and your poor brother.
"
"Doth he so seek his life?
"
"Has censured him
[p]Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
[p]A warrant for his execution.
"
"Alas! what poor ability's in me
[p]To do him good?
"
"Assay the power you have.
"
"My power? Alas, I doubt--
"
"Our doubts are traitors
[p]And make us lose the good we oft might win
[p]By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
[p]And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
[p]Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
[p]All their petitions are as freely theirs
[p]As they themselves would owe them.
"
"I'll see what I can do.
"
"But speedily.
"
"I will about it straight;
[p]No longer staying but to give the mother
[p]Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
[p]Commend me to my brother: soon at night
[p]I'll send him certain word of my success.
"
"I take my leave of you.
"
"Good sir, adieu.
"
"We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
[p]Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
[p]And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
[p]Their perch and not their terror.
"
"Ay, but yet
[p]Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
[p]Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
[p]Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
[p]Let but your honour know,
[p]Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
[p]That, in the working of your own affections,
[p]Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
[p]Or that the resolute acting of your blood
[p]Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
[p]Whether you had not sometime in your life
[p]Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
[p]And pull'd the law upon you.
"
"'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
[p]Another thing to fall. I not deny,
[p]The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
[p]May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
[p]Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
[p]That justice seizes: what know the laws
[p]That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
[p]The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
[p]Because we see it; but what we do not see
[p]We tread upon, and never think of it.
[p]You may not so extenuate his offence
[p]For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
[p]When I, that censure him, do so offend,
[p]Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
[p]And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
"
"Be it as your wisdom will.
"
"Where is the provost?
"
"Here, if it like your honour.
"
"See that Claudio
[p]Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
[p]Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
[p]For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
"
"[Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
[p]Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
[p]Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:
[p]And some condemned for a fault alone.
"
"Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
[p]a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
[p]common houses, I know no law: bring them away.
"
"How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?
"
"If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
[p]constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
[p]justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
[p]honour two notorious benefactors.
"
"Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
[p]they not malefactors?
"
"If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
[p]are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
[p]of; and void of all profanation in the world that
[p]good Christians ought to have.
"
"This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
"
"Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
[p]name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?
"
"He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
"
"What are you, sir?
"
"He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
[p]serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
[p]say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
[p]professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.
"
"How know you that?
"
"My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--
"
"How? thy wife?
"
"Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--
"
"Dost thou detest her therefore?
"
"I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
[p]she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
[p]it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.
"
"How dost thou know that, constable?
"
"Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
[p]cardinally given, might have been accused in
[p]fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
"
"By the woman's means?
"
"Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
[p]spit in his face, so she defied him.
"
"Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
"
"Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
[p]man; prove it.
"
"Do you hear how he misplaces?
"
"Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
[p]saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
[p]sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
[p]distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
[p]dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
[p]such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
[p]good dishes,--
"
"Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
"
"No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
[p]the right: but to the point. As I say, this
[p]Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
[p]being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
[p]prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
[p]Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
[p]rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
[p]honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
[p]not give you three-pence again.
"
"No, indeed.
"
"Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
[p]cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--
"
"Ay, so I did indeed.
"
"Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
[p]remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
[p]cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
[p]good diet, as I told you,--
"
"All this is true.
"
"Why, very well, then,--
"
"Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
[p]was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
[p]complain of? Come me to what was done to her.
"
"Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
"
"No, sir, nor I mean it not.
"
"Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
[p]leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
[p]here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
[p]father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
[p]Master Froth?
"
"All-hallond eve.
"
"Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
[p]sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
[p]the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
[p]to sit, have you not?
"
"I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.
"
"Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.
"
"This will last out a night in Russia,
[p]When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
[p]And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
[p]Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
"
"I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
[p][Exit ANGELO]
[p]Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
"
"Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.
"
"I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
"
"I beseech your honour, ask me.
"
"Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
"
"I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
[p]Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
[p]good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?
"
"Ay, sir, very well.
"
"Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.
"
"Well, I do so.
"
"Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
"
"Why, no.
"
"I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
[p]thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
[p]worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
[p]constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
[p]your honour.
"
"He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
"
"First, an it like you, the house is a respected
[p]house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
[p]mistress is a respected woman.
"
"By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
[p]person than any of us all.
"
"Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
[p]time has yet to come that she was ever respected
[p]with man, woman, or child.
"
"Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
"
"Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
[p]this true?
"
"O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
[p]Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
[p]to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
[p]with me, let not your worship think me the poor
[p]duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
[p]I'll have mine action of battery on thee.
"
"If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
[p]action of slander too.
"
"Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
[p]your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
"
"Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
[p]that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
[p]continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
[p]are.
"
"Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
[p]wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
[p]to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.
"
"Where were you born, friend?
"
"Here in Vienna, sir.
"
"Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
"
"Yes, an't please you, sir.
"
"So. What trade are you of, sir?
"
"Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.
"
"Your mistress' name?
"
"Mistress Overdone.
"
"Hath she had any more than one husband?
"
"Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
"
"Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
[p]Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
[p]tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
[p]will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
[p]more of you.
"
"I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
[p]come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
[p]in.
"
"Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
[p][Exit FROTH]
[p]Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
[p]name, Master tapster?
"
"Pompey.
"
"What else?
"
"Bum, sir.
"
"Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
[p]so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
[p]Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
[p]howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
[p]not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
"
"Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
"
"How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
[p]do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?
"
"If the law would allow it, sir.
"
"But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
[p]not be allowed in Vienna.
"
"Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
[p]youth of the city?
"
"No, Pompey.
"
"Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
[p]If your worship will take order for the drabs and
[p]the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
"
"There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
[p]it is but heading and hanging.
"
"If you head and hang all that offend that way but
[p]for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
[p]commission for more heads: if this law hold in
[p]Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
[p]after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
[p]come to pass, say Pompey told you so.
"
"Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
[p]prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
[p]you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
[p]no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
[p]I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
[p]Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
[p]have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
"
"I thank your worship for your good counsel:
[p][Aside]
[p]but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
[p]better determine.
[p]Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
[p]The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.
"
"Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
[p]constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?
"
"Seven year and a half, sir.
"
"I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
[p]continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?
"
"And a half, sir.
"
"Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
[p]wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
[p]in your ward sufficient to serve it?
"
"Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
[p]are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
[p]do it for some piece of money, and go through with
[p]all.
"
"Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
[p]the most sufficient of your parish.
"
"To your worship's house, sir?
"
"To my house. Fare you well.
[p][Exit ELBOW]
[p]What's o'clock, think you?
"
"Eleven, sir.
"
"I pray you home to dinner with me.
"
"I humbly thank you.
"
"It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
[p]But there's no remedy.
"
"Lord Angelo is severe.
"
"It is but needful:
[p]Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
[p]Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
[p]But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
[p]Come, sir.
"
"He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
[p]I'll tell him of you.
"
"Pray you, do.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p]I'll know
[p]His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
[p]He hath but as offended in a dream!
[p]All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
[p]To die for't!
"
"Now, what's the matter. Provost?
"
"Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
"
"Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
[p]Why dost thou ask again?
"
"Lest I might be too rash:
[p]Under your good correction, I have seen,
[p]When, after execution, judgment hath
[p]Repented o'er his doom.
"
"Go to; let that be mine:
[p]Do you your office, or give up your place,
[p]And you shall well be spared.
"
"I crave your honour's pardon.
[p]What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
[p]She's very near her hour.
"
"Dispose of her
[p]To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
"
"Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
[p]Desires access to you.
"
"Hath he a sister?
"
"Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
[p]And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
[p]If not already.
"
"Well, let her be admitted.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p]See you the fornicatress be removed:
[p]Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
[p]There shall be order for't.
"
"God save your honour!
"
"Stay a little while.
[p][To ISABELLA]
[p]You're welcome: what's your will?
"
"I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
[p]Please but your honour hear me.
"
"Well; what's your suit?
"
"There is a vice that most I do abhor,
[p]And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
[p]For which I would not plead, but that I must;
[p]For which I must not plead, but that I am
[p]At war 'twixt will and will not.
"
"Well; the matter?
"
"I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
[p]I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
[p]And not my brother.
"
"[Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces!
"
"Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
[p]Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
[p]Mine were the very cipher of a function,
[p]To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
[p]And let go by the actor.
"
"O just but severe law!
[p]I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!
"
"[Aside to ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so: to him
[p]again, entreat him;
[p]Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
[p]You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
[p]You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:
[p]To him, I say!
"
"Must he needs die?
"
"Maiden, no remedy.
"
"Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
[p]And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
"
"I will not do't.
"
"But can you, if you would?
"
"Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
"
"But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
[p]If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
[p]As mine is to him?
"
"He's sentenced; 'tis too late.
"
"[Aside to ISABELLA] You are too cold.
"
"Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
[p]May call it back again. Well, believe this,
[p]No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
[p]Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
[p]The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
[p]Become them with one half so good a grace
[p]As mercy does.
[p]If he had been as you and you as he,
[p]You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
[p]Would not have been so stern.
"
"Pray you, be gone.
"
"I would to heaven I had your potency,
[p]And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
[p]No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
[p]And what a prisoner.
"
"[Aside to ISABELLA]
[p]Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
"
"Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
[p]And you but waste your words.
"
"Alas, alas!
[p]Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
[p]And He that might the vantage best have took
[p]Found out the remedy. How would you be,
[p]If He, which is the top of judgment, should
[p]But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
[p]And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
[p]Like man new made.
"
"Be you content, fair maid;
[p]It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
[p]Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
[p]It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.
"
"To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
[p]He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
[p]We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
[p]With less respect than we do minister
[p]To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
[p]Who is it that hath died for this offence?
[p]There's many have committed it.
"
"[Aside to ISABELLA] Ay, well said.
"
"The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
[p]Those many had not dared to do that evil,
[p]If the first that did the edict infringe
[p]Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
[p]Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
[p]Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
[p]Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
[p]And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
[p]Are now to have no successive degrees,
[p]But, ere they live, to end.
"
"Yet show some pity.
"
"I show it most of all when I show justice;
[p]For then I pity those I do not know,
[p]Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
[p]And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
[p]Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
[p]Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.
"
"So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
[p]And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
[p]To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
[p]To use it like a giant.
"
"[Aside to ISABELLA] That's well said.
"
"Could great men thunder
[p]As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
[p]For every pelting, petty officer
[p]Would use his heaven for thunder;
[p]Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
[p]Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
[p]Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
[p]Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
[p]Drest in a little brief authority,
[p]Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
[p]His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
[p]Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
[p]As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
[p]Would all themselves laugh mortal.
"
"[Aside to ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! he
[p]will relent;
[p]He's coming; I perceive 't.
"
"[Aside] Pray heaven she win him!
"
"We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
[p]Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
[p]But in the less foul profanation.
"
"Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.
"
"That in the captain's but a choleric word,
[p]Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
"
"[Aside to ISABELLA] Art avised o' that? more on 't.
"
"Why do you put these sayings upon me?
"
"Because authority, though it err like others,
[p]Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
[p]That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
[p]Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
[p]That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
[p]A natural guiltiness such as is his,
[p]Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
[p]Against my brother's life.
"
"[Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
[p]Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.
"
"Gentle my lord, turn back.
"
"I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
"
"Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
"
"How! bribe me?
"
"Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
"
"[Aside to ISABELLA] You had marr'd all else.
"
"Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
[p]Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
[p]As fancy values them; but with true prayers
[p]That shall be up at heaven and enter there
[p]Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
[p]From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
[p]To nothing temporal.
"
"Well; come to me to-morrow.
"
"[Aside to ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away!
"
"Heaven keep your honour safe!
"
"[Aside]. Amen:
[p]For I am that way going to temptation,
[p]Where prayers cross.
"
"At what hour to-morrow
[p]Shall I attend your lordship?
"
"At any time 'fore noon.
"
"'Save your honour!
"
"From thee, even from thy virtue!
[p]What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
[p]The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
[p]Ha!
[p]Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
[p]That, lying by the violet in the sun,
[p]Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
[p]Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
[p]That modesty may more betray our sense
[p]Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
[p]Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
[p]And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
[p]What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
[p]Dost thou desire her foully for those things
[p]That make her good? O, let her brother live!
[p]Thieves for their robbery have authority
[p]When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
[p]That I desire to hear her speak again,
[p]And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
[p]O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
[p]With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
[p]Is that temptation that doth goad us on
[p]To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
[p]With all her double vigour, art and nature,
[p]Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
[p]Subdues me quite. Even till now,
[p]When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.
"
"Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.
"
"I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?
"
"Bound by my charity and my blest order,
[p]I come to visit the afflicted spirits
[p]Here in the prison. Do me the common right
[p]To let me see them and to make me know
[p]The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
[p]To them accordingly.
"
"I would do more than that, if more were needful.
[p][Enter JULIET]
[p]Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
[p]Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
[p]Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
[p]And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
[p]More fit to do another such offence
[p]Than die for this.
"
"When must he die?
"
"As I do think, to-morrow.
[p]I have provided for you: stay awhile,
[p][To JULIET]
[p]And you shall be conducted.
"
"Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
"
"I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
"
"I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
[p]And try your penitence, if it be sound,
[p]Or hollowly put on.
"
"I'll gladly learn.
"
"Love you the man that wrong'd you?
"
"Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
"
"So then it seems your most offenceful act
[p]Was mutually committed?
"
"Mutually.
"
"Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
"
"I do confess it, and repent it, father.
"
"'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
[p]As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
[p]Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
[p]Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
[p]But as we stand in fear,--
"
"I do repent me, as it is an evil,
[p]And take the shame with joy.
"
"There rest.
[p]Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
[p]And I am going with instruction to him.
[p]Grace go with you, Benedicite!
"
"Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
[p]That respites me a life, whose very comfort
[p]Is still a dying horror!
"
"'Tis pity of him.
"
"When I would pray and think, I think and pray
[p]To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
[p]Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
[p]Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
[p]As if I did but only chew his name;
[p]And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
[p]Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
[p]Is like a good thing, being often read,
[p]Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
[p]Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
[p]Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
[p]Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
[p]How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
[p]Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
[p]To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
[p]Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
[p]'Tis not the devil's crest.
[p][Enter a Servant]
[p]How now! who's there?
"
"One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
"
"Teach her the way.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p]O heavens!
[p]Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
[p]Making both it unable for itself,
[p]And dispossessing all my other parts
[p]Of necessary fitness?
[p]So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
[p]Come all to help him, and so stop the air
[p]By which he should revive: and even so
[p]The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
[p]Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
[p]Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
[p]Must needs appear offence.
[p][Enter ISABELLA]
[p]How now, fair maid?
"
"I am come to know your pleasure.
"
"That you might know it, would much better please me
[p]Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
"
"Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
"
"Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
[p]As long as you or I. yet he must die.
"
"Under your sentence?
"
"Yea.
"
"When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
[p]Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
[p]That his soul sicken not.
"
"Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
[p]To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
[p]A man already made, as to remit
[p]Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
[p]In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
[p]Falsely to take away a life true made
[p]As to put metal in restrained means
[p]To make a false one.
"
"'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
"
"Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
[p]Which had you rather, that the most just law
[p]Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
[p]Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
[p]As she that he hath stain'd?
"
"Sir, believe this,
[p]I had rather give my body than my soul.
"
"I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
[p]Stand more for number than for accompt.
"
"How say you?
"
"Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
[p]Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
[p]I, now the voice of the recorded law,
[p]Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
[p]Might there not be a charity in sin
[p]To save this brother's life?
"
"Please you to do't,
[p]I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
[p]It is no sin at all, but charity.
"
"Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
[p]Were equal poise of sin and charity.
"
"That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
[p]Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
[p]If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
[p]To have it added to the faults of mine,
[p]And nothing of your answer.
"
"Nay, but hear me.
[p]Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
[p]Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.
"
"Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
[p]But graciously to know I am no better.
"
"Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
[p]When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
[p]Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
[p]Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
[p]To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
[p]Your brother is to die.
"
"So.
"
"And his offence is so, as it appears,
[p]Accountant to the law upon that pain.
"
"True.
"
"Admit no other way to save his life,--
[p]As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
[p]But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
[p]Finding yourself desired of such a person,
[p]Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
[p]Could fetch your brother from the manacles
[p]Of the all-building law; and that there were
[p]No earthly mean to save him, but that either
[p]You must lay down the treasures of your body
[p]To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
[p]What would you do?
"
"As much for my poor brother as myself:
[p]That is, were I under the terms of death,
[p]The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
[p]And strip myself to death, as to a bed
[p]That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
[p]My body up to shame.
"
"Then must your brother die.
"
"And 'twere the cheaper way:
[p]Better it were a brother died at once,
[p]Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
[p]Should die for ever.
"
"Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
[p]That you have slander'd so?
"
"Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
[p]Are of two houses: lawful mercy
[p]Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
"
"You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
[p]And rather proved the sliding of your brother
[p]A merriment than a vice.
"
"O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
[p]To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
[p]I something do excuse the thing I hate,
[p]For his advantage that I dearly love.
"
"We are all frail.
"
"Else let my brother die,
[p]If not a feodary, but only he
[p]Owe and succeed thy weakness.
"
"Nay, women are frail too.
"
"Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
[p]Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
[p]Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
[p]In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
[p]For we are soft as our complexions are,
[p]And credulous to false prints.
"
"I think it well:
[p]And from this testimony of your own sex,--
[p]Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
[p]Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
[p]I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
[p]That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
[p]If you be one, as you are well express'd
[p]By all external warrants, show it now,
[p]By putting on the destined livery.
"
"I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
[p]Let me entreat you speak the former language.
"
"Plainly conceive, I love you.
"
"My brother did love Juliet,
[p]And you tell me that he shall die for it.
"
"He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
"
"I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
[p]Which seems a little fouler than it is,
[p]To pluck on others.
"
"Believe me, on mine honour,
[p]My words express my purpose.
"
"Ha! little honour to be much believed,
[p]And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
[p]I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
[p]Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
[p]Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
[p]What man thou art.
"
"Who will believe thee, Isabel?
[p]My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
[p]My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
[p]Will so your accusation overweigh,
[p]That you shall stifle in your own report
[p]And smell of calumny. I have begun,
[p]And now I give my sensual race the rein:
[p]Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
[p]Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
[p]That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
[p]By yielding up thy body to my will;
[p]Or else he must not only die the death,
[p]But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
[p]To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
[p]Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
[p]I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
[p]Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
"
"To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
[p]Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
[p]That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
[p]Either of condemnation or approof;
[p]Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
[p]Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
[p]To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
[p]Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
[p]Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
[p]That, had he twenty heads to tender down
[p]On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
[p]Before his sister should her body stoop
[p]To such abhorr'd pollution.
[p]Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
[p]More than our brother is our chastity.
[p]I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
[p]And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.
"
"So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
"
"The miserable have no other medicine
[p]But only hope:
[p]I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.
"
"Be absolute for death; either death or life
[p]Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
[p]If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
[p]That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
[p]Servile to all the skyey influences,
[p]That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
[p]Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
[p]For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
[p]And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
[p]For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
[p]Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
[p]For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
[p]Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
[p]And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
[p]Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
[p]For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
[p]That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
[p]For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
[p]And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
[p]For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
[p]After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
[p]For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
[p]Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
[p]And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
[p]For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
[p]The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
[p]Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
[p]For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
[p]But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
[p]Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
[p]Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
[p]Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
[p]Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
[p]To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
[p]That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
[p]Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
[p]That makes these odds all even.
"
"I humbly thank you.
[p]To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
[p]And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
"
"[Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
"
"Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
"
"Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
"
"Most holy sir, I thank you.
"
"My business is a word or two with Claudio.
"
"And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
"
"Provost, a word with you.
"
"As many as you please.
"
"Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
"
"Now, sister, what's the comfort?
"
"Why,
[p]As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
[p]Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
[p]Intends you for his swift ambassador,
[p]Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
[p]Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
[p]To-morrow you set on.
"
"Is there no remedy?
"
"None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
[p]To cleave a heart in twain.
"
"But is there any?
"
"Yes, brother, you may live:
[p]There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
[p]If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
[p]But fetter you till death.
"
"Perpetual durance?
"
"Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
[p]Though all the world's vastidity you had,
[p]To a determined scope.
"
"But in what nature?
"
"In such a one as, you consenting to't,
[p]Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
[p]And leave you naked.
"
"Let me know the point.
"
"O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
[p]Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
[p]And six or seven winters more respect
[p]Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
[p]The sense of death is most in apprehension;
[p]And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
[p]In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
[p]As when a giant dies.
"
"Why give you me this shame?
[p]Think you I can a resolution fetch
[p]From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
[p]I will encounter darkness as a bride,
[p]And hug it in mine arms.
"
"There spake my brother; there my father's grave
[p]Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
[p]Thou art too noble to conserve a life
[p]In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
[p]Whose settled visage and deliberate word
[p]Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
[p]As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
[p]His filth within being cast, he would appear
[p]A pond as deep as hell.
"
"The prenzie Angelo!
"
"O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
[p]The damned'st body to invest and cover
[p]In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
[p]If I would yield him my virginity,
[p]Thou mightst be freed.
"
"O heavens! it cannot be.
"
"Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
[p]So to offend him still. This night's the time
[p]That I should do what I abhor to name,
[p]Or else thou diest to-morrow.
"
"Thou shalt not do't.
"
"O, were it but my life,
[p]I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
[p]As frankly as a pin.
"
"Thanks, dear Isabel.
"
"Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
"
"Yes. Has he affections in him,
[p]That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
[p]When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
[p]Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.
"
"Which is the least?
"
"If it were damnable, he being so wise,
[p]Why would he for the momentary trick
[p]Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!
"
"What says my brother?
"
"Death is a fearful thing.
"
"And shamed life a hateful.
"
"Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
[p]To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
[p]This sensible warm motion to become
[p]A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
[p]To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
[p]In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
[p]To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
[p]And blown with restless violence round about
[p]The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
[p]Of those that lawless and incertain thought
[p]Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
[p]The weariest and most loathed worldly life
[p]That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
[p]Can lay on nature is a paradise
[p]To what we fear of death.
"
"Alas, alas!
"
"Sweet sister, let me live:
[p]What sin you do to save a brother's life,
[p]Nature dispenses with the deed so far
[p]That it becomes a virtue.
"
"O you beast!
[p]O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
[p]Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
[p]Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
[p]From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
[p]Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
[p]For such a warped slip of wilderness
[p]Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
[p]Die, perish! Might but my bending down
[p]Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
[p]I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
[p]No word to save thee.
"
"Nay, hear me, Isabel.
"
"O, fie, fie, fie!
[p]Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
[p]Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
[p]'Tis best thou diest quickly.
"
"O hear me, Isabella!
"
"Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
"
"What is your will?
"
"Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
[p]by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
[p]would require is likewise your own benefit.
"
"I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
[p]stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.
"
"Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
[p]and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
[p]corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
[p]virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
[p]of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
[p]hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
[p]glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
[p]know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
[p]death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
[p]that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
[p]your knees and make ready.
"
"Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
[p]with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
"
"Hold you there: farewell.
[p][Exit CLAUDIO]
[p]Provost, a word with you!
"
"What's your will, father
"
"That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
[p]awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
[p]habit no loss shall touch her by my company.
"
"In good time.
"
"The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
[p]the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
[p]brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
[p]your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
[p]fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
[p]fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
[p]that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
[p]wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
[p]substitute, and to save your brother?
"
"I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
[p]brother die by the law than my son should be
[p]unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
[p]deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
[p]speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
[p]discover his government.
"
"That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
[p]now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
[p]trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
[p]advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
[p]remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
[p]that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
[p]lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
[p]the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
[p]person; and much please the absent duke, if
[p]peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
[p]this business.
"
"Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
[p]anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
"
"Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
[p]you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
[p]Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
"
"I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
"
"She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
[p]to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
[p]which time of the contract and limit of the
[p]solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
[p]having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
[p]sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
[p]poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
[p]renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
[p]kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
[p]her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
[p]combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
"
"Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
"
"Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
[p]with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
[p]pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
[p]bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
[p]wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
[p]is washed with them, but relents not.
"
"What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
[p]from the world! What corruption in this life, that
[p]it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
"
"It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
[p]cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
[p]you from dishonour in doing it.
"
"Show me how, good father.
"
"This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
[p]of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
[p]in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
[p]like an impediment in the current, made it more
[p]violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
[p]requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
[p]his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
[p]this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
[p]not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
[p]silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
[p]This being granted in course,--and now follows
[p]all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
[p]your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
[p]acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
[p]her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
[p]saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
[p]advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
[p]will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
[p]think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
[p]of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
[p]What think you of it?
"
"The image of it gives me content already; and I
[p]trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
"
"It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
[p]to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
[p]bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
[p]presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
[p]grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
[p]place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
[p]it may be quickly.
"
"I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
"
"Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
[p]needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
[p]shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.
"
"O heavens! what stuff is here
"
"'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
[p]merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
[p]order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
[p]furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
[p]craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.
"
"Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.
"
"And you, good brother father. What offence hath
[p]this man made you, sir?
"
"Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
[p]take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
[p]upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
[p]sent to the deputy.
"
"Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
[p]The evil that thou causest to be done,
[p]That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
[p]What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
[p]From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
[p]From their abominable and beastly touches
[p]I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
[p]Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
[p]So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
"
"Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
[p]sir, I would prove--
"
"Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
[p]Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
[p]Correction and instruction must both work
[p]Ere this rude beast will profit.
"
"He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
[p]warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
[p]he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
[p]as good go a mile on his errand.
"
"That we were all, as some would seem to be,
[p]From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
"
"His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.
"
"I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
[p]friend of mine.
"
"How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
[p]Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
[p]none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
[p]had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
[p]extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
[p]sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
[p]not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
[p]thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
[p]the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
[p]trick of it?
"
"Still thus, and thus; still worse!
"
"How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
[p]still, ha?
"
"Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
[p]is herself in the tub.
"
"Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
[p]so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
[p]an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
[p]to prison, Pompey?
"
"Yes, faith, sir.
"
"Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
[p]sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?
"
"For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
"
"Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
[p]due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
[p]doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
[p]Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
[p]Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
[p]will keep the house.
"
"I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
"
"No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
[p]I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
[p]you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
[p]more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.
"
"And you.
"
"Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
"
"Come your ways, sir; come.
"
"You will not bail me, then, sir?
"
"Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
[p]what news?
"
"Come your ways, sir; come.
"
"Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
[p][Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers]
[p]What news, friar, of the duke?
"
"I know none. Can you tell me of any?
"
"Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
[p]some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?
"
"I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
"
"It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
[p]the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
[p]to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
[p]puts transgression to 't.
"
"He does well in 't.
"
"A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
[p]him: something too crabbed that way, friar.
"
"It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
"
"Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
[p]it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
[p]it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
[p]down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
[p]woman after this downright way of creation: is it
[p]true, think you?
"
"How should he be made, then?
"
"Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
[p]was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
[p]certain that when he makes water his urine is
[p]congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
[p]motion generative; that's infallible.
"
"You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
"
"Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
[p]rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
[p]man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
[p]Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
[p]hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
[p]a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
[p]knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
"
"I never heard the absent duke much detected for
[p]women; he was not inclined that way.
"
"O, sir, you are deceived.
"
"'Tis not possible.
"
"Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
[p]his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
[p]duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
[p]that let me inform you.
"
"You do him wrong, surely.
"
"Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
[p]duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
[p]withdrawing.
"
"What, I prithee, might be the cause?
"
"No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
[p]teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
[p]understand, the greater file of the subject held the
[p]duke to be wise.
"
"Wise! why, no question but he was.
"
"A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
"
"Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
[p]the very stream of his life and the business he hath
[p]helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
[p]proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
[p]bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
[p]envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
[p]Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
[p]knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.
"
"Sir, I know him, and I love him.
"
"Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
[p]dearer love.
"
"Come, sir, I know what I know.
"
"I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
[p]you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
[p]prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
[p]answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
[p]you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
[p]upon you; and, I pray you, your name?
"
"Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.
"
"He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
[p]report you.
"
"I fear you not.
"
"O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
[p]imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
[p]can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.
"
"I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
[p]friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
[p]Claudio die to-morrow or no?
"
"Why should he die, sir?
"
"Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
[p]the duke we talk of were returned again: the
[p]ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
[p]continency; sparrows must not build in his
[p]house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
[p]yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
[p]never bring them to light: would he were returned!
[p]Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
[p]Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
[p]duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
[p]Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
[p]he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
[p]bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.
"
"No might nor greatness in mortality
[p]Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
[p]The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
[p]Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
[p]But who comes here?
"
"Go; away with her to prison!
"
"Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
[p]a merciful man; good my lord.
"
"Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
[p]the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
[p]the tyrant.
"
"A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
[p]your honour.
"
"My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
[p]Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
[p]duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
[p]is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
[p]I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!
"
"That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
[p]called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
[p]no more words.
[p][Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE]
[p]Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
[p]Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
[p]with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
[p]if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
[p]so with him.
"
"So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
[p]advised him for the entertainment of death.
"
"Good even, good father.
"
"Bliss and goodness on you!
"
"Of whence are you?
"
"Not of this country, though my chance is now
[p]To use it for my time: I am a brother
[p]Of gracious order, late come from the See
[p]In special business from his holiness.
"
"What news abroad i' the world?
"
"None, but that there is so great a fever on
[p]goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
[p]novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
[p]to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
[p]to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
[p]truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
[p]security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
[p]upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
[p]news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
[p]pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?
"
"One that, above all other strifes, contended
[p]especially to know himself.
"
"What pleasure was he given to?
"
"Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
[p]any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
[p]gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
[p]his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
[p]and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
[p]prepared. I am made to understand that you have
[p]lent him visitation.
"
"He professes to have received no sinister measure
[p]from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
[p]to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
[p]to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
[p]deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
[p]leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
[p]resolved to die.
"
"You have paid the heavens your function, and the
[p]prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
[p]laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
[p]shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
[p]found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
[p]he is indeed Justice.
"
"If his own life answer the straitness of his
[p]proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
[p]chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.
"
"I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
"
"Peace be with you!
[p][Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost]
[p]He who the sword of heaven will bear
[p]Should be as holy as severe;
[p]Pattern in himself to know,
[p]Grace to stand, and virtue go;
[p]More nor less to others paying
[p]Than by self-offences weighing.
[p]Shame to him whose cruel striking
[p]Kills for faults of his own liking!
[p]Twice treble shame on Angelo,
[p]To weed my vice and let his grow!
[p]O, what may man within him hide,
[p]Though angel on the outward side!
[p]How may likeness made in crimes,
[p]Making practise on the times,
[p]To draw with idle spiders' strings
[p]Most ponderous and substantial things!
[p]Craft against vice I must apply:
[p]With Angelo to-night shall lie
[p]His old betrothed but despised;
[p]So disguise shall, by the disguised,
[p]Pay with falsehood false exacting,
[p]And perform an old contracting.
"
"Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
[p]Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
[p]Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
[p][Exit Boy]
[p][Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before]
[p]I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
[p]You had not found me here so musical:
[p]Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
[p]My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.
"
"'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
[p]To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
[p]I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
[p]for me here to-day? much upon this time have
[p]I promised here to meet.
"
"You have not been inquired after:
[p]I have sat here all day.
"
"I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
[p]now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
[p]be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.
"
"I am always bound to you.
"
"Very well met, and well come.
[p]What is the news from this good deputy?
"
"He hath a garden circummured with brick,
[p]Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
[p]And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
[p]That makes his opening with this bigger key:
[p]This other doth command a little door
[p]Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
[p]There have I made my promise
[p]Upon the heavy middle of the night
[p]To call upon him.
"
"But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
"
"I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
[p]With whispering and most guilty diligence,
[p]In action all of precept, he did show me
[p]The way twice o'er.
"
"Are there no other tokens
[p]Between you 'greed concerning her observance?
"
"No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
[p]And that I have possess'd him my most stay
[p]Can be but brief; for I have made him know
[p]I have a servant comes with me along,
[p]That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
[p]I come about my brother.
"
"'Tis well borne up.
[p]I have not yet made known to Mariana
[p]A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
[p][Re-enter MARIANA]
[p]I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
[p]She comes to do you good.
"
"I do desire the like.
"
"Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
"
"Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
"
"Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
[p]Who hath a story ready for your ear.
[p]I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
[p]The vaporous night approaches.
"
"Will't please you walk aside?
"
"O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
[p]Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
[p]Run with these false and most contrarious quests
[p]Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
[p]Make thee the father of their idle dreams
[p]And rack thee in their fancies.
[p][Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA]
[p]Welcome, how agreed?
"
"She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
[p]If you advise it.
"
"It is not my consent,
[p]But my entreaty too.
"
"Little have you to say
[p]When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
[p]'Remember now my brother.'
"
"Fear me not.
"
"Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
[p]He is your husband on a pre-contract:
[p]To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
[p]Sith that the justice of your title to him
[p]Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
[p]Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
"
"Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?
"
"If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
[p]married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
[p]cut off a woman's head.
"
"Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
[p]direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
[p]and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
[p]executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
[p]you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
[p]redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
[p]your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
[p]with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
[p]notorious bawd.
"
"Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
[p]but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
[p]would be glad to receive some instruction from my
[p]fellow partner.
"
"What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?
"
"Do you call, sir?
"
"Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
[p]your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
[p]him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
[p]not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
[p]cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.
"
"A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.
"
"Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
[p]the scale.
"
"Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
[p]good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
[p]look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?
"
"Ay, sir; a mystery
"
"Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
[p]your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
[p]using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
[p]but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
[p]should be hanged, I cannot imagine.
"
"Sir, it is a mystery.
"
"Proof?
"
"Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
[p]too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
[p]big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
[p]thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
[p]apparel fits your thief.
"
"Are you agreed?
"
"Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
[p]a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
[p]oftener ask forgiveness.
"
"You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
[p]to-morrow four o'clock.
"
"Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
"
"I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
[p]occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
[p]me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
[p]a good turn.
"
"Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
[p][Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON]
[p]The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
[p]Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
[p][Enter CLAUDIO]
[p]Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
[p]'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
[p]Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
"
"As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
[p]When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
[p]He will not wake.
"
"Who can do good on him?
[p]Well, go, prepare yourself.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]But, hark, what noise?
[p]Heaven give your spirits comfort!
[p][Exit CLAUDIO]
[p]By and by.
[p]I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
[p]For the most gentle Claudio.
[p][Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before]
[p]Welcome father.
"
"The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
[p]Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?
"
"None, since the curfew rung.
"
"Not Isabel?
"
"No.
"
"They will, then, ere't be long.
"
"What comfort is for Claudio?
"
"There's some in hope.
"
"It is a bitter deputy.
"
"Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
[p]Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
[p]He doth with holy abstinence subdue
[p]That in himself which he spurs on his power
[p]To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
[p]Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
[p]But this being so, he's just.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Now are they come.
[p][Exit Provost]
[p]This is a gentle provost: seldom when
[p]The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
[p]That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
"
"There he must stay until the officer
[p]Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
"
"Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
[p]But he must die to-morrow?
"
"None, sir, none.
"
"As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
[p]You shall hear more ere morning.
"
"Happily
[p]You something know; yet I believe there comes
[p]No countermand; no such example have we:
[p]Besides, upon the very siege of justice
[p]Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
[p]Profess'd the contrary.
[p][Enter a Messenger]
[p]This is his lordship's man.
"
"And here comes Claudio's pardon.
"
"[Giving a paper]
[p]My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this
[p]further charge, that you swerve not from the
[p]smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
[p]other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,
[p]it is almost day.
"
"I shall obey him.
"
"[Aside] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
[p]For which the pardoner himself is in.
[p]Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
[p]When it is born in high authority:
[p]When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
[p]That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
[p]Now, sir, what news?
"
"I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
[p]in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
[p]putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.
"
"Pray you, let's hear.
"
"[Reads]
[p]'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
[p]Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the
[p]afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,
[p]let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let
[p]this be duly performed; with a thought that more
[p]depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail
[p]not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
[p]What say you to this, sir?
"
"What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
[p]afternoon?
"
"A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
[p]that is a prisoner nine years old.
"
"How came it that the absent duke had not either
[p]delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
[p]have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
"
"His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
[p]indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
[p]Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
"
"It is now apparent?
"
"Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
"
"Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
[p]seems he to be touched?
"
"A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
[p]as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
[p]of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
[p]mortality, and desperately mortal.
"
"He wants advice.
"
"He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
[p]of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
[p]would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
[p]entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
[p]to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
[p]warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.
"
"More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
[p]provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
[p]truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
[p]boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
[p]Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
[p]no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
[p]sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
[p]manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
[p]for the which you are to do me both a present and a
[p]dangerous courtesy.
"
"Pray, sir, in what?
"
"In the delaying death.
"
"A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
[p]and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
[p]his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
[p]as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.
"
"By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
[p]instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
[p]be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.
"
"Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
"
"O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
[p]Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
[p]the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
[p]death: you know the course is common. If any thing
[p]fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
[p]fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
[p]against it with my life.
"
"Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
"
"Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?
"
"To him, and to his substitutes.
"
"You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
[p]avouch the justice of your dealing?
"
"But what likelihood is in that?
"
"Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
[p]you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
[p]persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
[p]further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
[p]Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
[p]duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
[p]signet is not strange to you.
"
"I know them both.
"
"The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
[p]shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
[p]shall find, within these two days he will be here.
[p]This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
[p]very day receives letters of strange tenor;
[p]perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
[p]into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
[p]is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
[p]shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
[p]things should be: all difficulties are but easy
[p]when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
[p]with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
[p]shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
[p]are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
[p]Come away; it is almost clear dawn.
"
"I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
[p]of profession: one would think it were Mistress
[p]Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
[p]customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
[p]for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
[p]ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
[p]five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
[p]much in request, for the old women were all dead.
[p]Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
[p]Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
[p]peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
[p]beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
[p]Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
[p]Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
[p]Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
[p]Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
[p]great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
[p]Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
[p]our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'
"
"Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
"
"Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
[p]Master Barnardine!
"
"What, ho, Barnardine!
"
"[Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that
[p]noise there? What are you?
"
"Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
[p]good, sir, to rise and be put to death.
"
"[Within] Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.
"
"Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
"
"Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
[p]executed, and sleep afterwards.
"
"Go in to him, and fetch him out.
"
"He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.
"
"Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
"
"Very ready, sir.
"
"How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?
"
"Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
[p]prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.
"
"You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
[p]fitted for 't.
"
"O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
[p]and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
[p]sounder all the next day.
"
"Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
[p]we jest now, think you?
"
"Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
[p]you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
[p]you and pray with you.
"
"Friar, not I. I have been drinking hard all night,
[p]and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
[p]shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
[p]consent to die this day, that's certain.
"
"O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
[p]Look forward on the journey you shall go.
"
"I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
[p]persuasion.
"
"But hear you.
"
"Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
[p]come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.
"
"Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
[p]After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
"
"Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
"
"A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
[p]And to transport him in the mind he is
[p]Were damnable.
"
"Here in the prison, father,
[p]There died this morning of a cruel fever
[p]One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
[p]A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
[p]Just of his colour. What if we do omit
[p]This reprobate till he were well inclined;
[p]And satisfy the deputy with the visage
[p]Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?
"
"O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
[p]Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
[p]Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
[p]And sent according to command; whiles I
[p]Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.
"
"This shall be done, good father, presently.
[p]But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
[p]And how shall we continue Claudio,
[p]To save me from the danger that might come
[p]If he were known alive?
"
"Let this be done.
[p]Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
[p]Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
[p]To the under generation, you shall find
[p]Your safety manifested.
"
"I am your free dependant.
"
"Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
[p][Exit Provost]
[p]Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
[p]The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
[p]Shall witness to him I am near at home,
[p]And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
[p]To enter publicly: him I'll desire
[p]To meet me at the consecrated fount
[p]A league below the city; and from thence,
[p]By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
[p]We shall proceed with Angelo.
"
"Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
"
"Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
[p]For I would commune with you of such things
[p]That want no ear but yours.
"
"I'll make all speed.
"
"[Within] Peace, ho, be here!
"
"The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
[p]If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
[p]But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
[p]To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
[p]When it is least expected.
"
"Ho, by your leave!
"
"Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
"
"The better, given me by so holy a man.
[p]Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
"
"He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
[p]His head is off and sent to Angelo.
"
"Nay, but it is not so.
"
"It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
[p]In your close patience.
"
"O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
"
"You shall not be admitted to his sight.
"
"Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
[p]Injurious world! most damned Angelo!
"
"This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
[p]Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
[p]Mark what I say, which you shall find
[p]By every syllable a faithful verity:
[p]The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
[p]One of our convent, and his confessor,
[p]Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
[p]Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
[p]Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
[p]There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
[p]In that good path that I would wish it go,
[p]And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
[p]Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
[p]And general honour.
"
"I am directed by you.
"
"This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
[p]'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
[p]Say, by this token, I desire his company
[p]At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
[p]I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
[p]Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
[p]Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
[p]I am combined by a sacred vow
[p]And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
[p]Command these fretting waters from your eyes
[p]With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
[p]If I pervert your course. Who's here?
"
"Good even. Friar, where's the provost?
"
"Not within, sir.
"
"O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
[p]thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
[p]to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
[p]my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
[p]me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
[p]to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
[p]if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
[p]at home, he had lived.
"
"Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
[p]reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.
"
"Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
[p]he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
"
"Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
"
"Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
[p]I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
"
"You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
[p]they be true; if not true, none were enough.
"
"I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
"
"Did you such a thing?
"
"Yes, marry, did I. but I was fain to forswear it;
[p]they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
"
"Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
"
"By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
[p]if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
[p]it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.
"
"Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
"
"In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
[p]show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
[p]not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
[p]redeliver our authorities there
"
"I guess not.
"
"And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
[p]entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
[p]they should exhibit their petitions in the street?
"
"He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
[p]complaints, and to deliver us from devices
[p]hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
[p]against us.
"
"Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
[p]i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
[p]notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
[p]him.
"
"I shall, sir. Fare you well.
"
"Good night.
[p][Exit ESCALUS]
[p]This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
[p]And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
[p]And by an eminent body that enforced
[p]The law against it! But that her tender shame
[p]Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
[p]How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
[p]For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
[p]That no particular scandal once can touch
[p]But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
[p]Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
[p]Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
[p]By so receiving a dishonour'd life
[p]With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
[p]A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
[p]Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.
"
"These letters at fit time deliver me
[p][Giving letters]
[p]The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
[p]The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
[p]And hold you ever to our special drift;
[p]Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
[p]As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
[p]And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
[p]To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
[p]And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
[p]But send me Flavius first.
"
"It shall be speeded well.
"
"I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
[p]Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
[p]Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
"
"To speak so indirectly I am loath:
[p]I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
[p]That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
[p]He says, to veil full purpose.
"
"Be ruled by him.
"
"Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
[p]He speak against me on the adverse side,
[p]I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
[p]That's bitter to sweet end.
"
"I would Friar Peter--
"
"O, peace! the friar is come.
"
"Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
[p]Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
[p]He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
[p]The generous and gravest citizens
[p]Have hent the gates, and very near upon
[p]The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!
"
"My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
[p]Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
"
"[with Escalus] Happy return be to your royal grace!
"
"Many and hearty thankings to you both.
[p]We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
[p]Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
[p]Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
[p]Forerunning more requital.
"
"You make my bonds still greater.
"
"O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
[p]To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
[p]When it deserves, with characters of brass,
[p]A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
[p]And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
[p]And let the subject see, to make them know
[p]That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
[p]Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
[p]You must walk by us on our other hand;
[p]And good supporters are you.
"
"Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.
"
"Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
[p]Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
[p]O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
[p]By throwing it on any other object
[p]Till you have heard me in my true complaint
[p]And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
"
"Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
[p]Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
[p]Reveal yourself to him.
"
"O worthy duke,
[p]You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
[p]Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
[p]Must either punish me, not being believed,
[p]Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!
"
"My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
[p]She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
[p]Cut off by course of justice,--
"
"By course of justice!
"
"And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
"
"Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
[p]That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
[p]That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
[p]That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
[p]An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
[p]Is it not strange and strange?
"
"Nay, it is ten times strange.
"
"It is not truer he is Angelo
[p]Than this is all as true as it is strange:
[p]Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
[p]To the end of reckoning.
"
"Away with her! Poor soul,
[p]She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.
"
"O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
[p]There is another comfort than this world,
[p]That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
[p]That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
[p]That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
[p]But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
[p]May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
[p]As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
[p]In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
[p]Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
[p]If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
[p]Had I more name for badness.
"
"By mine honesty,
[p]If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
[p]Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
[p]Such a dependency of thing on thing,
[p]As e'er I heard in madness.
"
"O gracious duke,
[p]Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
[p]For inequality; but let your reason serve
[p]To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
[p]And hide the false seems true.
"
"Many that are not mad
[p]Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
"
"I am the sister of one Claudio,
[p]Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
[p]To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
[p]I, in probation of a sisterhood,
[p]Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
[p]As then the messenger,--
"
"That's I, an't like your grace:
[p]I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
[p]To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
[p]For her poor brother's pardon.
"
"That's he indeed.
"
"You were not bid to speak.
"
"No, my good lord;
[p]Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
"
"I wish you now, then;
[p]Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
[p]A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
[p]Be perfect.
"
"I warrant your honour.
"
"The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
"
"This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
"
"Right.
"
"It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
[p]To speak before your time. Proceed.
"
"I went
[p]To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--
"
"That's somewhat madly spoken.
"
"Pardon it;
[p]The phrase is to the matter.
"
"Mended again. The matter; proceed.
"
"In brief, to set the needless process by,
[p]How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
[p]How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
[p]For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
[p]I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
[p]He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
[p]To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
[p]Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
[p]My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
[p]And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
[p]His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
[p]For my poor brother's head.
"
"This is most likely!
"
"O, that it were as like as it is true!
"
"By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
[p]Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
[p]In hateful practise. First, his integrity
[p]Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
[p]That with such vehemency he should pursue
[p]Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
[p]He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
[p]And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
[p]Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
[p]Thou camest here to complain.
"
"And is this all?
[p]Then, O you blessed ministers above,
[p]Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
[p]Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
[p]In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
[p]As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
"
"I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
[p]To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
[p]A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
[p]On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
[p]Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
"
"One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
"
"A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
"
"My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
[p]I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
[p]For certain words he spake against your grace
[p]In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.
"
"Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
[p]And to set on this wretched woman here
[p]Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
"
"But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
[p]I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
[p]A very scurvy fellow.
"
"Blessed be your royal grace!
[p]I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
[p]Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
[p]Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
[p]Who is as free from touch or soil with her
[p]As she from one ungot.
"
"We did believe no less.
[p]Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
"
"I know him for a man divine and holy;
[p]Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
[p]As he's reported by this gentleman;
[p]And, on my trust, a man that never yet
[p]Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.
"
"My lord, most villanously; believe it.
"
"Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
[p]But at this instant he is sick my lord,
[p]Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
[p]Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
[p]Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
[p]To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
[p]Is true and false; and what he with his oath
[p]And all probation will make up full clear,
[p]Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
[p]To justify this worthy nobleman,
[p]So vulgarly and personally accused,
[p]Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
[p]Till she herself confess it.
"
"Good friar, let's hear it.
[p][ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward]
[p]Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
[p]O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
[p]Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
[p]In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
[p]Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
[p]First, let her show her face, and after speak.
"
"Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
[p]Until my husband bid me.
"
"What, are you married?
"
"No, my lord.
"
"Are you a maid?
"
"No, my lord.
"
"A widow, then?
"
"Neither, my lord.
"
"Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
"
"My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
[p]neither maid, widow, nor wife.
"
"Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
[p]To prattle for himself.
"
"Well, my lord.
"
"My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
[p]And I confess besides I am no maid:
[p]I have known my husband; yet my husband
[p]Knows not that ever he knew me.
"
"He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.
"
"For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
"
"Well, my lord.
"
"This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
"
"Now I come to't my lord
[p]She that accuses him of fornication,
[p]In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
[p]And charges him my lord, with such a time
[p]When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
[p]With all the effect of love.
"
"Charges she more than me?
"
"Not that I know.
"
"No? you say your husband.
"
"Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
[p]Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
[p]But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
"
"This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
"
"My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
[p][Unveiling]
[p]This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
[p]Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
[p]This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
[p]Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
[p]That took away the match from Isabel,
[p]And did supply thee at thy garden-house
[p]In her imagined person.
"
"Know you this woman?
"
"Carnally, she says.
"
"Sirrah, no more!
"
"Enough, my lord.
"
"My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
[p]And five years since there was some speech of marriage
[p]Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
[p]Partly for that her promised proportions
[p]Came short of composition, but in chief
[p]For that her reputation was disvalued
[p]In levity: since which time of five years
[p]I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
[p]Upon my faith and honour.
"
"Noble prince,
[p]As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
[p]As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
[p]I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
[p]As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
[p]But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
[p]He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
[p]Let me in safety raise me from my knees
[p]Or else for ever be confixed here,
[p]A marble monument!
"
"I did but smile till now:
[p]Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
[p]My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
[p]These poor informal women are no more
[p]But instruments of some more mightier member
[p]That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
[p]To find this practise out.
"
"Ay, with my heart
[p]And punish them to your height of pleasure.
[p]Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
[p]Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
[p]Though they would swear down each particular saint,
[p]Were testimonies against his worth and credit
[p]That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
[p]Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
[p]To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
[p]There is another friar that set them on;
[p]Let him be sent for.
"
"Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
[p]Hath set the women on to this complaint:
[p]Your provost knows the place where he abides
[p]And he may fetch him.
"
"Go do it instantly.
[p][Exit Provost]
[p]And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
[p]Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
[p]Do with your injuries as seems you best,
[p]In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
[p]But stir not you till you have well determined
[p]Upon these slanderers.
"
"My lord, we'll do it throughly.
[p][Exit DUKE]
[p]Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
[p]Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
"
"'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
[p]but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
[p]villanous speeches of the duke.
"
"We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
[p]enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
[p]notable fellow.
"
"As any in Vienna, on my word.
"
"Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
[p][Exit an Attendant]
[p]Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
[p]shall see how I'll handle her.
"
"Not better than he, by her own report.
"
"Say you?
"
"Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
[p]she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
[p]she'll be ashamed.
"
"I will go darkly to work with her.
"
"That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
[p][Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with]
[p]the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit]
"
"Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
[p]that you have said.
"
"My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
[p]the provost.
"
"In very good time: speak not you to him till we
[p]call upon you.
"
"Mum.
"
"Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
[p]Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
"
"'Tis false.
"
"How! know you where you are?
"
"Respect to your great place! and let the devil
[p]Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
[p]Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
"
"The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
[p]Look you speak justly.
"
"Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
[p]Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
[p]Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
[p]Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
[p]Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
[p]And put your trial in the villain's mouth
[p]Which here you come to accuse.
"
"This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
"
"Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
[p]Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
[p]To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
[p]And in the witness of his proper ear,
[p]To call him villain? and then to glance from him
[p]To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
[p]Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
[p]Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
[p]What 'unjust'!
"
"Be not so hot; the duke
[p]Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
[p]Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
[p]Nor here provincial. My business in this state
[p]Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
[p]Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
[p]Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
[p]But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
[p]Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
[p]As much in mock as mark.
"
"Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
"
"What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
[p]Is this the man that you did tell us of?
"
"'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
[p]do you know me?
"
"I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
[p]met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.
"
"O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?
"
"Most notedly, sir.
"
"Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
[p]fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
"
"You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
[p]that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
[p]much more, much worse.
"
"O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
[p]nose for thy speeches?
"
"I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
"
"Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
[p]treasonable abuses!
"
"Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
[p]him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
[p]to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
[p]speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
[p]with the other confederate companion!
"
"[To Provost] Stay, sir; stay awhile.
"
"What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
"
"Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
[p]bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
[p]you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
[p]show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
[p]Will't not off?
"
"Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
[p]First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
[p][To LUCIO]
[p]Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
[p]Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
"
"This may prove worse than hanging.
"
"[To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
[p]We'll borrow place of him.
[p][To ANGELO]
[p]Sir, by your leave.
[p]Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
[p]That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
[p]Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
[p]And hold no longer out.
"
"O my dread lord,
[p]I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
[p]To think I can be undiscernible,
[p]When I perceive your grace, like power divine,. Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
[p]No longer session hold upon my shame,
[p]But let my trial be mine own confession:
[p]Immediate sentence then and sequent death
[p]Is all the grace I beg.
"
"Come hither, Mariana.
[p]Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
"
"I was, my lord.
"
"Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
[p]Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
[p]Return him here again. Go with him, provost.
"
"My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
[p]Than at the strangeness of it.
"
"Come hither, Isabel.
[p]Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
[p]Advertising and holy to your business,
[p]Not changing heart with habit, I am still
[p]Attorney'd at your service.
"
"O, give me pardon,
[p]That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
[p]Your unknown sovereignty!
"
"You are pardon'd, Isabel:
[p]And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
[p]Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
[p]And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
[p]Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
[p]Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
[p]Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
[p]It was the swift celerity of his death,
[p]Which I did think with slower foot came on,
[p]That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
[p]That life is better life, past fearing death,
[p]Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
[p]So happy is your brother.
"
"I do, my lord.
"
"For this new-married man approaching here,
[p]Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
[p]Your well defended honour, you must pardon
[p]For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
[p]Being criminal, in double violation
[p]Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
[p]Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
[p]The very mercy of the law cries out
[p]Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
[p]'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
[p]Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
[p]Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
[p]Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
[p]Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
[p]We do condemn thee to the very block
[p]Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
[p]Away with him!
"
"O my most gracious lord,
[p]I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
"
"It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
[p]Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
[p]I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
[p]For that he knew you, might reproach your life
[p]And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
[p]Although by confiscation they are ours,
[p]We do instate and widow you withal,
[p]To buy you a better husband.
"
"O my dear lord,
[p]I crave no other, nor no better man.
"
"Never crave him; we are definitive.
"
"Gentle my liege,--
"
"You do but lose your labour.
[p]Away with him to death!
[p][To LUCIO]
[p]Now, sir, to you.
"
"O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
[p]Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
[p]I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
"
"Against all sense you do importune her:
[p]Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
[p]Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
[p]And take her hence in horror.
"
"Isabel,
[p]Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
[p]Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
[p]They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
[p]And, for the most, become much more the better
[p]For being a little bad: so may my husband.
[p]O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
"
"He dies for Claudio's death.
"
"Most bounteous sir,
[p][Kneeling]
[p]Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
[p]As if my brother lived: I partly think
[p]A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
[p]Till he did look on me: since it is so,
[p]Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
[p]In that he did the thing for which he died:
[p]For Angelo,
[p]His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
[p]And must be buried but as an intent
[p]That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
[p]Intents but merely thoughts.
"
"Merely, my lord.
"
"Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
[p]I have bethought me of another fault.
[p]Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
[p]At an unusual hour?
"
"It was commanded so.
"
"Had you a special warrant for the deed?
"
"No, my good lord; it was by private message.
"
"For which I do discharge you of your office:
[p]Give up your keys.
"
"Pardon me, noble lord:
[p]I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
[p]Yet did repent me, after more advice;
[p]For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
[p]That should by private order else have died,
[p]I have reserved alive.
"
"What's he?
"
"His name is Barnardine.
"
"I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
[p]Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
"
"I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
[p]As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
[p]Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
[p]And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
"
"I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
[p]And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
[p]That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
[p]'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
[p][Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled,]
[p]and JULIET]
"
"Which is that Barnardine?
"
"This, my lord.
"
"There was a friar told me of this man.
[p]Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
[p]That apprehends no further than this world,
[p]And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
[p]But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
[p]And pray thee take this mercy to provide
[p]For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
[p]I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?
"
"This is another prisoner that I saved.
[p]Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
[p]As like almost to Claudio as himself.
"
"[To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake
[p]Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
[p]Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
[p]He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
[p]By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
[p]Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
[p]Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
[p]Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
[p]I find an apt remission in myself;
[p]And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
[p][To LUCIO]
[p]You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
[p]One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
[p]Wherein have I so deserved of you,
[p]That you extol me thus?
"
"'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
[p]trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
[p]had rather it would please you I might be whipt.
"
"Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
[p]Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
[p]Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
[p]As I have heard him swear himself there's one
[p]Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
[p]And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
[p]Let him be whipt and hang'd.
"
"I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
[p]Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
[p]good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.
"
"Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
[p]Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
[p]Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
[p]And see our pleasure herein executed.
"
"Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
[p]whipping, and hanging.
"
"Slandering a prince deserves it.
[p][Exit Officers with LUCIO]
[p]She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
[p]Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
[p]I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
[p]Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
[p]There's more behind that is more gratulate.
[p]Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
[p]We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
[p]Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
[p]The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
[p]The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
[p]I have a motion much imports your good;
[p]Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
[p]What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
[p]So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
[p]What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
"
"In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
[p]It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
[p]But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
[p]What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
[p]I am to learn;
[p]And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
[p]That I have much ado to know myself.
"
"Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
[p]There, where your argosies with portly sail,
[p]Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
[p]Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
[p]Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
[p]That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
[p]As they fly by them with their woven wings.
"
"Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
[p]The better part of my affections would
[p]Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
[p]Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
[p]Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
[p]And every object that might make me fear
[p]Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
[p]Would make me sad.
"
"My wind cooling my broth
[p]Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
[p]What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
[p]I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
[p]But I should think of shallows and of flats,
[p]And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
[p]Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
[p]To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
[p]And see the holy edifice of stone,
[p]And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
[p]Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
[p]Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
[p]Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
[p]And, in a word, but even now worth this,
[p]And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
[p]To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
[p]That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
[p]But tell not me; I know, Antonio
[p]Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
"
"Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
[p]My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
[p]Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
[p]Upon the fortune of this present year:
[p]Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
"
"Why, then you are in love.
"
"Fie, fie!
"
"Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
[p]Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
[p]For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
[p]Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
[p]Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
[p]Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
[p]And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
[p]And other of such vinegar aspect
[p]That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
[p]Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
"
"Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
[p]Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
[p]We leave you now with better company.
"
"I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
[p]If worthier friends had not prevented me.
"
"Your worth is very dear in my regard.
[p]I take it, your own business calls on you
[p]And you embrace the occasion to depart.
"
"Good morrow, my good lords.
"
"Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
[p]You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
"
"We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
"
"My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
[p]We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
[p]I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
"
"I will not fail you.
"
"You look not well, Signior Antonio;
[p]You have too much respect upon the world:
[p]They lose it that do buy it with much care:
[p]Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
"
"I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
[p]A stage where every man must play a part,
[p]And mine a sad one.
"
"Let me play the fool:
[p]With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
[p]And let my liver rather heat with wine
[p]Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
[p]Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
[p]Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
[p]Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
[p]By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
[p]I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
[p]There are a sort of men whose visages
[p]Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
[p]And do a wilful stillness entertain,
[p]With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
[p]Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
[p]As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
[p]And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
[p]O my Antonio, I do know of these
[p]That therefore only are reputed wise
[p]For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
[p]If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
[p]Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
[p]I'll tell thee more of this another time:
[p]But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
[p]For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
[p]Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
[p]I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
"
"Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
[p]I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
[p]For Gratiano never lets me speak.
"
"Well, keep me company but two years moe,
[p]Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
"
"Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
"
"Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
[p]In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
"
"Is that any thing now?
"
"Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
[p]than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
[p]grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
[p]shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
[p]have them, they are not worth the search.
"
"Well, tell me now what lady is the same
[p]To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
[p]That you to-day promised to tell me of?
"
"'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
[p]How much I have disabled mine estate,
[p]By something showing a more swelling port
[p]Than my faint means would grant continuance:
[p]Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
[p]From such a noble rate; but my chief care
[p]Is to come fairly off from the great debts
[p]Wherein my time something too prodigal
[p]Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
[p]I owe the most, in money and in love,
[p]And from your love I have a warranty
[p]To unburden all my plots and purposes
[p]How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
"
"I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
[p]And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
[p]Within the eye of honour, be assured,
[p]My purse, my person, my extremest means,
[p]Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
"
"In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
[p]I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
[p]The self-same way with more advised watch,
[p]To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
[p]I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
[p]Because what follows is pure innocence.
[p]I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
[p]That which I owe is lost; but if you please
[p]To shoot another arrow that self way
[p]Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
[p]As I will watch the aim, or to find both
[p]Or bring your latter hazard back again
[p]And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
"
"You know me well, and herein spend but time
[p]To wind about my love with circumstance;
[p]And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
[p]In making question of my uttermost
[p]Than if you had made waste of all I have:
[p]Then do but say to me what I should do
[p]That in your knowledge may by me be done,
[p]And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
"
"In Belmont is a lady richly left;
[p]And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
[p]Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
[p]I did receive fair speechless messages:
[p]Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
[p]To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
[p]Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
[p]For the four winds blow in from every coast
[p]Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
[p]Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
[p]Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
[p]And many Jasons come in quest of her.
[p]O my Antonio, had I but the means
[p]To hold a rival place with one of them,
[p]I have a mind presages me such thrift,
[p]That I should questionless be fortunate!
"
"Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
[p]Neither have I money nor commodity
[p]To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
[p]Try what my credit can in Venice do:
[p]That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
[p]To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
[p]Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
[p]Where money is, and I no question make
[p]To have it of my trust or for my sake.
"
"By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
[p]this great world.
"
"You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
[p]the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
[p]yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
[p]with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
[p]is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
[p]mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
[p]competency lives longer.
"
"Good sentences and well pronounced.
"
"They would be better, if well followed.
"
"If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
[p]do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
[p]cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
[p]follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
[p]twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
[p]twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
[p]devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
[p]o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
[p]youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
[p]cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
[p]choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
[p]neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
[p]dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
[p]by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
[p]Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
"
"Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
[p]death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
[p]that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
[p]silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
[p]chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
[p]rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
[p]warmth is there in your affection towards any of
[p]these princely suitors that are already come?
"
"I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
[p]them, I will describe them; and, according to my
[p]description, level at my affection.
"
"First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
"
"Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
[p]talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
[p]appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
[p]shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
[p]mother played false with a smith.
"
"Then there is the County Palatine.
"
"He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
[p]will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
[p]smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
[p]philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
[p]unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
[p]married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
[p]than to either of these. God defend me from these
[p]two!
"
"How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
"
"God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
[p]In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
[p]he! why, he hath a horse better than the
[p]Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
[p]the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
[p]throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
[p]fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
[p]should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
[p]I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
[p]shall never requite him.
"
"What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
[p]of England?
"
"You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
[p]not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
[p]nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
[p]swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
[p]He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
[p]converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
[p]I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
[p]hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
[p]behavior every where.
"
"What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
"
"That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
[p]borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
[p]swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
[p]think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
[p]under for another.
"
"How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
"
"Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
[p]most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
[p]he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
[p]when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
[p]and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
[p]make shift to go without him.
"
"If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
[p]casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
[p]will, if you should refuse to accept him.
"
"Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
[p]deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
[p]for if the devil be within and that temptation
[p]without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
[p]thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
"
"You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
[p]lords: they have acquainted me with their
[p]determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
[p]home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
[p]you may be won by some other sort than your father's
[p]imposition depending on the caskets.
"
"If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
[p]chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
[p]of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
[p]are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
[p]but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
[p]them a fair departure.
"
"Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
[p]Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
[p]in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
"
"Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.
"
"True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
[p]eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
"
"I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
[p]thy praise.
[p][Enter a Serving-man]
[p]How now! what news?
"
"The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
[p]their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
[p]fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
[p]prince his master will be here to-night.
"
"If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
[p]heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
[p]be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
[p]of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
[p]rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
[p]Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
[p]Whiles we shut the gates
[p]upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.
"
"Three thousand ducats; well.
"
"Ay, sir, for three months.
"
"For three months; well.
"
"For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
"
"Antonio shall become bound; well.
"
"May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
[p]know your answer?
"
"Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
"
"Your answer to that.
"
"Antonio is a good man.
"
"Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
"
"Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
[p]good man is to have you understand me that he is
[p]sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
[p]hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
[p]Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
[p]hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
[p]other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
[p]are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
[p]and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
[p]mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
[p]winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
[p]sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
[p]take his bond.
"
"Be assured you may.
"
"I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
[p]I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
"
"If it please you to dine with us.
"
"Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
[p]your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
[p]will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
[p]walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
[p]with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
[p]news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
"
"This is Signior Antonio.
"
"[Aside] How like a fawning publican he looks!
[p]I hate him for he is a Christian,
[p]But more for that in low simplicity
[p]He lends out money gratis and brings down
[p]The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
[p]If I can catch him once upon the hip,
[p]I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
[p]He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
[p]Even there where merchants most do congregate,
[p]On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
[p]Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
[p]If I forgive him!
"
"Shylock, do you hear?
"
"I am debating of my present store,
[p]And, by the near guess of my memory,
[p]I cannot instantly raise up the gross
[p]Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
[p]Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
[p]Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
[p]Do you desire?
[p][To ANTONIO]
[p]Rest you fair, good signior;
[p]Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
"
"Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
[p]By taking nor by giving of excess,
[p]Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
[p]I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
[p]How much ye would?
"
"Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
"
"And for three months.
"
"I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
[p]Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
[p]Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
[p]Upon advantage.
"
"I do never use it.
"
"When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
[p]This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
[p]As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
[p]The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
"
"And what of him? did he take interest?
"
"No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
[p]Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
[p]When Laban and himself were compromised
[p]That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
[p]Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
[p]In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
[p]And, when the work of generation was
[p]Between these woolly breeders in the act,
[p]The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
[p]And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
[p]He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
[p]Who then conceiving did in eaning time
[p]Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
[p]This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
[p]And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
"
"This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
[p]A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
[p]But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
[p]Was this inserted to make interest good?
[p]Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
"
"I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
[p]But note me, signior.
"
"Mark you this, Bassanio,
[p]The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
[p]An evil soul producing holy witness
[p]Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
[p]A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
[p]O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
"
"Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
[p]Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--
"
"Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
"
"Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
[p]In the Rialto you have rated me
[p]About my moneys and my usances:
[p]Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
[p]For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
[p]You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
[p]And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
[p]And all for use of that which is mine own.
[p]Well then, it now appears you need my help:
[p]Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
[p]'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
[p]You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
[p]And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
[p]Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
[p]What should I say to you? Should I not say
[p]'Hath a dog money? is it possible
[p]A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
[p]Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
[p]With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
[p]'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
[p]You spurn'd me such a day; another time
[p]You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
[p]I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
"
"I am as like to call thee so again,
[p]To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
[p]If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
[p]As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
[p]A breed for barren metal of his friend?
[p]But lend it rather to thine enemy,
[p]Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
[p]Exact the penalty.
"
"Why, look you, how you storm!
[p]I would be friends with you and have your love,
[p]Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
[p]Supply your present wants and take no doit
[p]Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
[p]This is kind I offer.
"
"This were kindness.
"
"This kindness will I show.
[p]Go with me to a notary, seal me there
[p]Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
[p]If you repay me not on such a day,
[p]In such a place, such sum or sums as are
[p]Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
[p]Be nominated for an equal pound
[p]Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
[p]In what part of your body pleaseth me.
"
"Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
[p]And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
"
"You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
[p]I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
"
"Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
[p]Within these two months, that's a month before
[p]This bond expires, I do expect return
[p]Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
"
"O father Abram, what these Christians are,
[p]Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
[p]The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
[p]If he should break his day, what should I gain
[p]By the exaction of the forfeiture?
[p]A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
[p]Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
[p]As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
[p]To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
[p]If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
[p]And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
"
"Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
"
"Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
[p]Give him direction for this merry bond,
[p]And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
[p]See to my house, left in the fearful guard
[p]Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
[p]I will be with you.
"
"Hie thee, gentle Jew.
[p][Exit Shylock]
[p]The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
"
"I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
"
"Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
[p]My ships come home a month before the day.
"
"Mislike me not for my complexion,
[p]The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
[p]To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
[p]Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
[p]Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
[p]And let us make incision for your love,
[p]To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
[p]I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
[p]Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
[p]The best-regarded virgins of our clime
[p]Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
[p]Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
"
"In terms of choice I am not solely led
[p]By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
[p]Besides, the lottery of my destiny
[p]Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
[p]But if my father had not scanted me
[p]And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
[p]His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
[p]Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
[p]As any comer I have look'd on yet
[p]For my affection.
"
"Even for that I thank you:
[p]Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
[p]To try my fortune. By this scimitar
[p]That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
[p]That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
[p]I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
[p]Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
[p]Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
[p]Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
[p]To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
[p]If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
[p]Which is the better man, the greater throw
[p]May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
[p]So is Alcides beaten by his page;
[p]And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
[p]Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
[p]And die with grieving.
"
"You must take your chance,
[p]And either not attempt to choose at all
[p]Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
[p]Never to speak to lady afterward
[p]In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
"
"Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
"
"First, forward to the temple: after dinner
[p]Your hazard shall be made.
"
"Good fortune then!
[p]To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
"
"Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
[p]this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
[p]tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
[p]Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
[p]Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
[p]conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;
[p]take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
[p]Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
[p]heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
[p]pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
[p]fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
[p]says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
[p]hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
[p]to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
[p]man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,
[p]indeed, my father did something smack, something
[p]grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
[p]says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
[p]fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
[p]'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
[p]say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
[p]conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
[p]who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
[p]run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
[p]fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
[p]himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
[p]incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
[p]but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
[p]me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
[p]friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are
[p]at your command; I will run.
"
"Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way
[p]to master Jew's?
"
"[Aside] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!
[p]who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,
[p]knows me not: I will try confusions with him.
"
"Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way
[p]to master Jew's?
"
"Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
[p]at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at
[p]the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
[p]down indirectly to the Jew's house.
"
"By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
[p]you tell me whether one Launcelot,
[p]that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
"
"Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
[p][Aside]
[p]Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
[p]of young Master Launcelot?
"
"No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
[p]though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
[p]and, God be thanked, well to live.
"
"Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
[p]young Master Launcelot.
"
"Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.
"
"But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
[p]talk you of young Master Launcelot?
"
"Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
"
"Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
[p]Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,
[p]according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
[p]sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
[p]learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
[p]in plain terms, gone to heaven.
"
"Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
[p]age, my very prop.
"
"Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
[p]a prop? Do you know me, father?
"
"Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
[p]but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
[p]soul, alive or dead?
"
"Do you not know me, father?
"
"Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
"
"Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
[p]the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
[p]own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
[p]your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
[p]to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
[p]may, but at the length truth will out.
"
"Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not
[p]Launcelot, my boy.
"
"Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
[p]give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy
[p]that was, your son that is, your child that shall
[p]be.
"
"I cannot think you are my son.
"
"I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
[p]Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your
[p]wife is my mother.
"
"Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou
[p]be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
[p]Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
[p]got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
[p]Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
"
"It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
[p]backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
[p]than I have of my face when I last saw him.
"
"Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy
[p]master agree? I have brought him a present. How
[p]'gree you now?
"
"Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set
[p]up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
[p]have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
[p]him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
[p]his service; you may tell every finger I have with
[p]my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
[p]your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
[p]gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
[p]will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
[p]fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I
[p]am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
"
"You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
[p]be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
[p]these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,
[p]and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
"
"To him, father.
"
"God bless your worship!
"
"Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?
"
"Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--
"
"Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that
[p]would, sir, as my father shall specify--
"
"He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--
"
"Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
[p]and have a desire, as my father shall specify--
"
"His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
[p]are scarce cater-cousins--
"
"To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having
[p]done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I
[p]hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--
"
"I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
[p]your worship, and my suit is--
"
"In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
[p]your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,
[p]though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
"
"One speak for both. What would you?
"
"Serve you, sir.
"
"That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
"
"I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
[p]Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
[p]And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
[p]To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
[p]The follower of so poor a gentleman.
"
"The old proverb is very well parted between my
[p]master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of
[p]God, sir, and he hath enough.
"
"Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
[p]Take leave of thy old master and inquire
[p]My lodging out. Give him a livery
[p]More guarded than his fellows': see it done.
"
"Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have
[p]ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
[p]Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
[p]upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
[p]here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
[p]of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
[p]widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
[p]man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be
[p]in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
[p]here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
[p]woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
[p]come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
"
"I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
[p]These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
[p]Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
[p]My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.
"
"My best endeavours shall be done herein.
"
"Where is your master?
"
"Yonder, sir, he walks.
"
"Signior Bassanio!
"
"Gratiano!
"
"I have a suit to you.
"
"You have obtain'd it.
"
"You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
"
"Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
[p]Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
[p]Parts that become thee happily enough
[p]And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
[p]But where thou art not known, why, there they show
[p]Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
[p]To allay with some cold drops of modesty
[p]Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
[p]I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
[p]And lose my hopes.
"
"Signior Bassanio, hear me:
[p]If I do not put on a sober habit,
[p]Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
[p]Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
[p]Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
[p]Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
[p]Use all the observance of civility,
[p]Like one well studied in a sad ostent
[p]To please his grandam, never trust me more.
"
"Well, we shall see your bearing.
"
"Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
[p]By what we do to-night.
"
"No, that were pity:
[p]I would entreat you rather to put on
[p]Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
[p]That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
[p]I have some business.
"
"And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
[p]But we will visit you at supper-time.
"
"I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
[p]Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
[p]Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
[p]But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
[p]And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
[p]Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
[p]Give him this letter; do it secretly;
[p]And so farewell: I would not have my father
[p]See me in talk with thee.
"
"Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
[p]pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play
[p]the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,
[p]adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
[p]manly spirit: adieu.
"
"Farewell, good Launcelot.
[p][Exit Launcelot]
[p]Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
[p]To be ashamed to be my father's child!
[p]But though I am a daughter to his blood,
[p]I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
[p]If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
[p]Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
"
"Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
[p]Disguise us at my lodging and return,
[p]All in an hour.
"
"We have not made good preparation.
"
"We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
"
"'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
[p]And better in my mind not undertook.
"
"'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
[p]To furnish us.
[p][Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter]
[p]Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
"
"An it shall please you to break up
[p]this, it shall seem to signify.
"
"I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
[p]And whiter than the paper it writ on
[p]Is the fair hand that writ.
"
"Love-news, in faith.
"
"By your leave, sir.
"
"Whither goest thou?
"
"Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
[p]Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
"
"Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
[p]I will not fail her; speak it privately.
[p]Go, gentlemen,
[p][Exit Launcelot]
[p]Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
[p]I am provided of a torch-bearer.
"
"Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
"
"And so will I.
"
"Meet me and Gratiano
[p]At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
"
"'Tis good we do so.
"
"Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
"
"I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
[p]How I shall take her from her father's house,
[p]What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
[p]What page's suit she hath in readiness.
[p]If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
[p]It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
[p]And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
[p]Unless she do it under this excuse,
[p]That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
[p]Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
[p]Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.
"
"Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
[p]The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
[p]What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
[p]As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
[p]And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
[p]Why, Jessica, I say!
"
"Why, Jessica!
"
"Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
"
"Your worship was wont to tell me that
[p]I could do nothing without bidding.
"
"Call you? what is your will?
"
"I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
[p]There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
[p]I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
[p]But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
[p]The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
[p]Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
[p]There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
[p]For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
"
"I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
[p]your reproach.
"
"So do I his.
"
"An they have conspired together, I will not say you
[p]shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not
[p]for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
[p]Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
[p]falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
[p]year, in the afternoon.
"
"What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
[p]Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
[p]And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
[p]Clamber not you up to the casements then,
[p]Nor thrust your head into the public street
[p]To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
[p]But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
[p]Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
[p]My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
[p]I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
[p]But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
[p]Say I will come.
"
"I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
[p]window, for all this, There will come a Christian
[p]boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.
"
"What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
"
"His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.
"
"The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
[p]Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
[p]More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
[p]Therefore I part with him, and part with him
[p]To one that would have him help to waste
[p]His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
[p]Perhaps I will return immediately:
[p]Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
[p]Fast bind, fast find;
[p]A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
"
"Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
[p]I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
"
"This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
[p]Desired us to make stand.
"
"His hour is almost past.
"
"And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
[p]For lovers ever run before the clock.
"
"O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
[p]To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
[p]To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
"
"That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
[p]With that keen appetite that he sits down?
[p]Where is the horse that doth untread again
[p]His tedious measures with the unbated fire
[p]That he did pace them first? All things that are,
[p]Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
[p]How like a younker or a prodigal
[p]The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
[p]Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
[p]How like the prodigal doth she return,
[p]With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
[p]Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
"
"Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
"
"Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
[p]Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
[p]When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
[p]I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
[p]Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
"
"Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
[p]Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
"
"Lorenzo, and thy love.
"
"Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
[p]For who love I so much? And now who knows
[p]But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
"
"Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
"
"Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
[p]I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
[p]For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
[p]But love is blind and lovers cannot see
[p]The pretty follies that themselves commit;
[p]For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
[p]To see me thus transformed to a boy.
"
"Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
"
"What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
[p]They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
[p]Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
[p]And I should be obscured.
"
"So are you, sweet,
[p]Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
[p]But come at once;
[p]For the close night doth play the runaway,
[p]And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
"
"I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
[p]With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
"
"Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.
"
"Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
[p]For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
[p]And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
[p]And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
[p]And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
[p]Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
[p][Enter JESSICA, below]
[p]What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!
[p]Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
"
"Who's there?
"
"Signior Antonio!
"
"Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
[p]'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
[p]No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
[p]Bassanio presently will go aboard:
[p]I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
"
"I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
[p]Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
"
"Go draw aside the curtains and discover
[p]The several caskets to this noble prince.
[p]Now make your choice.
"
"The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
[p]'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
[p]The second, silver, which this promise carries,
[p]'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
[p]This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
[p]'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
[p]How shall I know if I do choose the right?
"
"The one of them contains my picture, prince:
[p]If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
"
"Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
[p]I will survey the inscriptions back again.
[p]What says this leaden casket?
[p]'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
[p]Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
[p]This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
[p]Do it in hope of fair advantages:
[p]A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
[p]I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
[p]What says the silver with her virgin hue?
[p]'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
[p]As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
[p]And weigh thy value with an even hand:
[p]If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
[p]Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
[p]May not extend so far as to the lady:
[p]And yet to be afeard of my deserving
[p]Were but a weak disabling of myself.
[p]As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
[p]I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
[p]In graces and in qualities of breeding;
[p]But more than these, in love I do deserve.
[p]What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
[p]Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
[p]'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
[p]Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
[p]From the four corners of the earth they come,
[p]To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
[p]The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
[p]Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
[p]For princes to come view fair Portia:
[p]The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
[p]Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
[p]To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
[p]As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
[p]One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
[p]Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
[p]To think so base a thought: it were too gross
[p]To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
[p]Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
[p]Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
[p]O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
[p]Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
[p]A coin that bears the figure of an angel
[p]Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
[p]But here an angel in a golden bed
[p]Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
[p]Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
"
"There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
[p]Then I am yours.
"
"O hell! what have we here?
[p]A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
[p]There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
[p][Reads]
[p]All that glitters is not gold;
[p]Often have you heard that told:
[p]Many a man his life hath sold
[p]But my outside to behold:
[p]Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
[p]Had you been as wise as bold,
[p]Young in limbs, in judgment old,
[p]Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
[p]Fare you well; your suit is cold.
[p]Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
[p]Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
[p]Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
[p]To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
"
"A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
[p]Let all of his complexion choose me so.
"
"Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
[p]With him is Gratiano gone along;
[p]And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
"
"The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
[p]Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
"
"He came too late, the ship was under sail:
[p]But there the duke was given to understand
[p]That in a gondola were seen together
[p]Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
[p]Besides, Antonio certified the duke
[p]They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
"
"I never heard a passion so confused,
[p]So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
[p]As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
[p]'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
[p]Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
[p]Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
[p]A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
[p]Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
[p]And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
[p]Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
[p]She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'
"
"Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
[p]Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
"
"Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
[p]Or he shall pay for this.
"
"Marry, well remember'd.
[p]I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
[p]Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
[p]The French and English, there miscarried
[p]A vessel of our country richly fraught:
[p]I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
[p]And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
"
"You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
[p]Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
"
"A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
[p]I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
[p]Bassanio told him he would make some speed
[p]Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
[p]Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
[p]But stay the very riping of the time;
[p]And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
[p]Let it not enter in your mind of love:
[p]Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
[p]To courtship and such fair ostents of love
[p]As shall conveniently become you there:'
[p]And even there, his eye being big with tears,
[p]Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
[p]And with affection wondrous sensible
[p]He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
"
"I think he only loves the world for him.
[p]I pray thee, let us go and find him out
[p]And quicken his embraced heaviness
[p]With some delight or other.
"
"Do we so.
"
"Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
[p]The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
[p]And comes to his election presently.
[p][Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,]
[p]PORTIA, and their trains]
"
"Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
[p]If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
[p]Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
[p]But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
[p]You must be gone from hence immediately.
"
"I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
[p]First, never to unfold to any one
[p]Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
[p]Of the right casket, never in my life
[p]To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
[p]If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
[p]Immediately to leave you and be gone.
"
"To these injunctions every one doth swear
[p]That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
"
"And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
[p]To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
[p]'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
[p]You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
[p]What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
[p]'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
[p]What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
[p]By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
[p]Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
[p]Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
[p]Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
[p]Even in the force and road of casualty.
[p]I will not choose what many men desire,
[p]Because I will not jump with common spirits
[p]And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
[p]Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
[p]Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
[p]'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
[p]And well said too; for who shall go about
[p]To cozen fortune and be honourable
[p]Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
[p]To wear an undeserved dignity.
[p]O, that estates, degrees and offices
[p]Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
[p]Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
[p]How many then should cover that stand bare!
[p]How many be commanded that command!
[p]How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
[p]From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
[p]Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
[p]To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
[p]'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
[p]I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
[p]And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
"
"Too long a pause for that which you find there.
"
"What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
[p]Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
[p]How much unlike art thou to Portia!
[p]How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
[p]'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
[p]Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
[p]Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
"
"To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
[p]And of opposed natures.
"
"What is here?
[p][Reads]
[p]The fire seven times tried this:
[p]Seven times tried that judgment is,
[p]That did never choose amiss.
[p]Some there be that shadows kiss;
[p]Such have but a shadow's bliss:
[p]There be fools alive, I wis,
[p]Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
[p]Take what wife you will to bed,
[p]I will ever be your head:
[p]So be gone: you are sped.
[p]Still more fool I shall appear
[p]By the time I linger here
[p]With one fool's head I came to woo,
[p]But I go away with two.
[p]Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
[p]Patiently to bear my wroth.
"
"Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
[p]O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
[p]They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
"
"The ancient saying is no heresy,
[p]Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
"
"Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
"
"Where is my lady?
"
"Here: what would my lord?
"
"Madam, there is alighted at your gate
[p]A young Venetian, one that comes before
[p]To signify the approaching of his lord;
[p]From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
[p]To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
[p]Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
[p]So likely an ambassador of love:
[p]A day in April never came so sweet,
[p]To show how costly summer was at hand,
[p]As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
"
"No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
[p]Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
[p]Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
[p]Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
[p]Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
"
"Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!
"
"Now, what news on the Rialto?
"
"Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath
[p]a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
[p]the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very
[p]dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
[p]a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
[p]Report be an honest woman of her word.
"
"I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
[p]knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
[p]wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
[p]true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
[p]plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
[p]honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
[p]to keep his name company!--
"
"Come, the full stop.
"
"Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
[p]lost a ship.
"
"I would it might prove the end of his losses.
"
"Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
[p]prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
[p][Enter SHYLOCK]
[p]How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?
"
"You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
[p]daughter's flight.
"
"That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
[p]that made the wings she flew withal.
"
"And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
[p]fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
[p]to leave the dam.
"
"She is damned for it.
"
"That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
"
"My own flesh and blood to rebel!
"
"Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?
"
"I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
"
"There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
[p]than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
[p]than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
[p]tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
[p]loss at sea or no?
"
"There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
[p]prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
[p]Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
[p]the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
[p]call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
[p]wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
[p]look to his bond.
"
"Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take
[p]his flesh: what's that good for?
"
"To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
[p]it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
[p]hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
[p]mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
[p]bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
[p]enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
[p]not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
[p]dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
[p]the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
[p]to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
[p]warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
[p]a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
[p]if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
[p]us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
[p]revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
[p]resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
[p]what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
[p]wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
[p]Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
[p]teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
[p]will better the instruction.
"
"Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and
[p]desires to speak with you both.
"
"We have been up and down to seek him.
"
"Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
[p]matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
"
"How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
[p]found my daughter?
"
"I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
"
"Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,
[p]cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
[p]never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
[p]till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
[p]precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
[p]were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
[p]would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
[p]her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
[p]not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
[p]loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
[p]find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
[p]nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
[p]shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
[p]but of my shedding.
"
"Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I
[p]heard in Genoa,--
"
"What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?
"
"Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.
"
"I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?
"
"I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
"
"I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
[p]ha, ha! where? in Genoa?
"
"Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one
[p]night fourscore ducats.
"
"Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
[p]gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
[p]fourscore ducats!
"
"There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
[p]company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.
"
"I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
[p]him: I am glad of it.
"
"One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
[p]daughter for a monkey.
"
"Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
[p]turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
[p]I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
"
"But Antonio is certainly undone.
"
"Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee
[p]me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
[p]will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were
[p]he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
[p]will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
[p]go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.
"
"I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
[p]Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
[p]I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
[p]There's something tells me, but it is not love,
[p]I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
[p]Hate counsels not in such a quality.
[p]But lest you should not understand me well,--
[p]And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
[p]I would detain you here some month or two
[p]Before you venture for me. I could teach you
[p]How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
[p]So will I never be: so may you miss me;
[p]But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
[p]That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
[p]They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
[p]One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
[p]Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
[p]And so all yours. O, these naughty times
[p]Put bars between the owners and their rights!
[p]And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
[p]Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
[p]I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
[p]To eke it and to draw it out in length,
[p]To stay you from election.
"
"Let me choose
[p]For as I am, I live upon the rack.
"
"Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
[p]What treason there is mingled with your love.
"
"None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
[p]Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
[p]There may as well be amity and life
[p]'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
"
"Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
[p]Where men enforced do speak anything.
"
"Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
"
"Well then, confess and live.
"
"'Confess' and 'love'
[p]Had been the very sum of my confession:
[p]O happy torment, when my torturer
[p]Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
[p]But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
"
"Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
[p]If you do love me, you will find me out.
[p]Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
[p]Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
[p]Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
[p]Fading in music: that the comparison
[p]May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
[p]And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
[p]And what is music then? Then music is
[p]Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
[p]To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
[p]As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
[p]That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
[p]And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
[p]With no less presence, but with much more love,
[p]Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
[p]The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
[p]To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
[p]The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
[p]With bleared visages, come forth to view
[p]The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
[p]Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
[p]I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
[p][Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself]
[p]SONG.
[p]Tell me where is fancy bred,
[p]Or in the heart, or in the head?
[p]How begot, how nourished?
[p]Reply, reply.
[p]It is engender'd in the eyes,
[p]With gazing fed; and fancy dies
[p]In the cradle where it lies.
[p]Let us all ring fancy's knell
[p]I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.
"
"Ding, dong, bell.
"
"So may the outward shows be least themselves:
[p]The world is still deceived with ornament.
[p]In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
[p]But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
[p]Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
[p]What damned error, but some sober brow
[p]Will bless it and approve it with a text,
[p]Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
[p]There is no vice so simple but assumes
[p]Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
[p]How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
[p]As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
[p]The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
[p]Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
[p]And these assume but valour's excrement
[p]To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
[p]And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
[p]Which therein works a miracle in nature,
[p]Making them lightest that wear most of it:
[p]So are those crisped snaky golden locks
[p]Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
[p]Upon supposed fairness, often known
[p]To be the dowry of a second head,
[p]The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
[p]Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
[p]To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
[p]Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
[p]The seeming truth which cunning times put on
[p]To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
[p]Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
[p]Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
[p]'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
[p]Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
[p]Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
[p]And here choose I; joy be the consequence!
"
"[Aside] How all the other passions fleet to air,
[p]As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
[p]And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,
[p]Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
[p]In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
[p]I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
[p]For fear I surfeit.
"
"What find I here?
[p][Opening the leaden casket]
[p]Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
[p]Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
[p]Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
[p]Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
[p]Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
[p]Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
[p]The painter plays the spider and hath woven
[p]A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
[p]Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
[p]How could he see to do them? having made one,
[p]Methinks it should have power to steal both his
[p]And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
[p]The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
[p]In underprizing it, so far this shadow
[p]Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
[p]The continent and summary of my fortune.
[p][Reads]
[p]You that choose not by the view,
[p]Chance as fair and choose as true!
[p]Since this fortune falls to you,
[p]Be content and seek no new,
[p]If you be well pleased with this
[p]And hold your fortune for your bliss,
[p]Turn you where your lady is
[p]And claim her with a loving kiss.
[p]A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
[p]I come by note, to give and to receive.
[p]Like one of two contending in a prize,
[p]That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
[p]Hearing applause and universal shout,
[p]Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
[p]Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
[p]So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
[p]As doubtful whether what I see be true,
[p]Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
"
"You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
[p]Such as I am: though for myself alone
[p]I would not be ambitious in my wish,
[p]To wish myself much better; yet, for you
[p]I would be trebled twenty times myself;
[p]A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
[p]That only to stand high in your account,
[p]I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
[p]Exceed account; but the full sum of me
[p]Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
[p]Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
[p]Happy in this, she is not yet so old
[p]But she may learn; happier than this,
[p]She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
[p]Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
[p]Commits itself to yours to be directed,
[p]As from her lord, her governor, her king.
[p]Myself and what is mine to you and yours
[p]Is now converted: but now I was the lord
[p]Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
[p]Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
[p]This house, these servants and this same myself
[p]Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
[p]Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
[p]Let it presage the ruin of your love
[p]And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
"
"Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
[p]Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
[p]And there is such confusion in my powers,
[p]As after some oration fairly spoke
[p]By a beloved prince, there doth appear
[p]Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
[p]Where every something, being blent together,
[p]Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
[p]Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
[p]Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
[p]O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
"
"My lord and lady, it is now our time,
[p]That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
[p]To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!
"
"My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
[p]I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
[p]For I am sure you can wish none from me:
[p]And when your honours mean to solemnize
[p]The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
[p]Even at that time I may be married too.
"
"With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
"
"I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
[p]My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
[p]You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
[p]You loved, I loved for intermission.
[p]No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
[p]Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
[p]And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
[p]For wooing here until I sweat again,
[p]And sweating until my very roof was dry
[p]With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
[p]I got a promise of this fair one here
[p]To have her love, provided that your fortune
[p]Achieved her mistress.
"
"Is this true, Nerissa?
"
"Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
"
"And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
"
"Yes, faith, my lord.
"
"Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
"
"We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
"
"What, and stake down?
"
"No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
[p]But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
[p]and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
[p][Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger]
[p]from Venice]
"
"Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
[p]If that the youth of my new interest here
[p]Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
[p]I bid my very friends and countrymen,
[p]Sweet Portia, welcome.
"
"So do I, my lord:
[p]They are entirely welcome.
"
"I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
[p]My purpose was not to have seen you here;
[p]But meeting with Salerio by the way,
[p]He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
[p]To come with him along.
"
"I did, my lord;
[p]And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
[p]Commends him to you.
"
"Ere I ope his letter,
[p]I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
"
"Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
[p]Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
[p]Will show you his estate.
"
"Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
[p]Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
[p]How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
[p]I know he will be glad of our success;
[p]We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
"
"I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
"
"There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
[p]That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
[p]Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
[p]Could turn so much the constitution
[p]Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
[p]With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
[p]And I must freely have the half of anything
[p]That this same paper brings you.
"
"O sweet Portia,
[p]Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
[p]That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
[p]When I did first impart my love to you,
[p]I freely told you, all the wealth I had
[p]Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
[p]And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
[p]Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
[p]How much I was a braggart. When I told you
[p]My state was nothing, I should then have told you
[p]That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
[p]I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
[p]Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
[p]To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
[p]The paper as the body of my friend,
[p]And every word in it a gaping wound,
[p]Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
[p]Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
[p]From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
[p]From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
[p]And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
[p]Of merchant-marring rocks?
"
"Not one, my lord.
[p]Besides, it should appear, that if he had
[p]The present money to discharge the Jew,
[p]He would not take it. Never did I know
[p]A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
[p]So keen and greedy to confound a man:
[p]He plies the duke at morning and at night,
[p]And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
[p]If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
[p]The duke himself, and the magnificoes
[p]Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
[p]But none can drive him from the envious plea
[p]Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
"
"When I was with him I have heard him swear
[p]To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
[p]That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
[p]Than twenty times the value of the sum
[p]That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
[p]If law, authority and power deny not,
[p]It will go hard with poor Antonio.
"
"Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
"
"The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
[p]The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
[p]In doing courtesies, and one in whom
[p]The ancient Roman honour more appears
[p]Than any that draws breath in Italy.
"
"What sum owes he the Jew?
"
"For me three thousand ducats.
"
"What, no more?
[p]Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
[p]Double six thousand, and then treble that,
[p]Before a friend of this description
[p]Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
[p]First go with me to church and call me wife,
[p]And then away to Venice to your friend;
[p]For never shall you lie by Portia's side
[p]With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
[p]To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
[p]When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
[p]My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
[p]Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
[p]For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
[p]Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
[p]Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
[p]But let me hear the letter of your friend.
"
"[Reads] Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
[p]miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
[p]very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
[p]in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
[p]debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
[p]see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
[p]pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
[p]let not my letter.
"
"O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!
"
"Since I have your good leave to go away,
[p]I will make haste: but, till I come again,
[p]No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
[p]No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
"
"Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
[p]This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
[p]Gaoler, look to him.
"
"Hear me yet, good Shylock.
"
"I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
[p]I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
[p]Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
[p]But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
[p]The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
[p]Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
[p]To come abroad with him at his request.
"
"I pray thee, hear me speak.
"
"I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
[p]I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
[p]I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
[p]To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
[p]To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
[p]I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
"
"It is the most impenetrable cur
[p]That ever kept with men.
"
"Let him alone:
[p]I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
[p]He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
[p]I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
[p]Many that have at times made moan to me;
[p]Therefore he hates me.
"
"I am sure the duke
[p]Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
"
"The duke cannot deny the course of law:
[p]For the commodity that strangers have
[p]With us in Venice, if it be denied,
[p]Will much impeach the justice of his state;
[p]Since that the trade and profit of the city
[p]Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
[p]These griefs and losses have so bated me,
[p]That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
[p]To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
[p]Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
[p]To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
"
"Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
[p]You have a noble and a true conceit
[p]Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
[p]In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
[p]But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
[p]How true a gentleman you send relief,
[p]How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
[p]I know you would be prouder of the work
[p]Than customary bounty can enforce you.
"
"I never did repent for doing good,
[p]Nor shall not now: for in companions
[p]That do converse and waste the time together,
[p]Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
[p]There must be needs a like proportion
[p]Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
[p]Which makes me think that this Antonio,
[p]Being the bosom lover of my lord,
[p]Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
[p]How little is the cost I have bestow'd
[p]In purchasing the semblance of my soul
[p]From out the state of hellish misery!
[p]This comes too near the praising of myself;
[p]Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
[p]Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
[p]The husbandry and manage of my house
[p]Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
[p]I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
[p]To live in prayer and contemplation,
[p]Only attended by Nerissa here,
[p]Until her husband and my lord's return:
[p]There is a monastery two miles off;
[p]And there will we abide. I do desire you
[p]Not to deny this imposition;
[p]The which my love and some necessity
[p]Now lays upon you.
"
"Madam, with all my heart;
[p]I shall obey you in all fair commands.
"
"My people do already know my mind,
[p]And will acknowledge you and Jessica
[p]In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
[p]And so farewell, till we shall meet again.
"
"Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
"
"I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
"
"I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
[p]To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
[p][Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO]
[p]Now, Balthasar,
[p]As I have ever found thee honest-true,
[p]So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
[p]And use thou all the endeavour of a man
[p]In speed to Padua: see thou render this
[p]Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
[p]And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
[p]Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
[p]Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
[p]Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
[p]But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.
"
"Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
"
"Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
[p]That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
[p]Before they think of us.
"
"Shall they see us?
"
"They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
[p]That they shall think we are accomplished
[p]With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
[p]When we are both accoutred like young men,
[p]I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
[p]And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
[p]And speak between the change of man and boy
[p]With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
[p]Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
[p]Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
[p]How honourable ladies sought my love,
[p]Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
[p]I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
[p]And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
[p]And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
[p]That men shall swear I have discontinued school
[p]Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
[p]A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
[p]Which I will practise.
"
"Why, shall we turn to men?
"
"Fie, what a question's that,
[p]If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
[p]But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
[p]When I am in my coach, which stays for us
[p]At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
[p]For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
"
"Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father
[p]are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
[p]promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
[p]you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
[p]therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
[p]are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
[p]you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
[p]hope neither.
"
"And what hope is that, I pray thee?
"
"Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
[p]not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
"
"That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
[p]sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
"
"Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
[p]mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
[p]fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
[p]gone both ways.
"
"I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
[p]Christian.
"
"Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
[p]enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
[p]another. This making Christians will raise the
[p]price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
[p]shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
"
"I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.
"
"I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
[p]you thus get my wife into corners.
"
"Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
[p]are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
[p]me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
[p]says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
[p]for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
[p]price of pork.
"
"I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
[p]you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
[p]Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
"
"It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
[p]but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
[p]indeed more than I took her for.
"
"How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
[p]best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
[p]and discourse grow commendable in none only but
[p]parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.
"
"That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
"
"Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
[p]them prepare dinner.
"
"That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.
"
"Will you cover then, sir?
"
"Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
"
"Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
[p]the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
[p]tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
[p]go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve
[p]in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
"
"For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the
[p]meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in
[p]to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
[p]conceits shall govern.
"
"O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
[p]The fool hath planted in his memory
[p]An army of good words; and I do know
[p]A many fools, that stand in better place,
[p]Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
[p]Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
[p]And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
[p]How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
"
"Past all expressing. It is very meet
[p]The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
[p]For, having such a blessing in his lady,
[p]He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
[p]And if on earth he do not mean it, then
[p]In reason he should never come to heaven
[p]Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
[p]And on the wager lay two earthly women,
[p]And Portia one, there must be something else
[p]Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
[p]Hath not her fellow.
"
"Even such a husband
[p]Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
"
"Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
"
"I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.
"
"Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
"
"No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
[p]I shall digest it.
"
"Well, I'll set you forth.
"
"What, is Antonio here?
"
"Ready, so please your grace.
"
"I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
[p]A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
[p]uncapable of pity, void and empty
[p]From any dram of mercy.
"
"I have heard
[p]Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
[p]His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
[p]And that no lawful means can carry me
[p]Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
[p]My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
[p]To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
[p]The very tyranny and rage of his.
"
"Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
"
"He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
"
"Make room, and let him stand before our face.
[p]Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
[p]That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
[p]To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
[p]Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
[p]Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
[p]And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
[p]Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
[p]Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
[p]But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
[p]Forgive a moiety of the principal;
[p]Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
[p]That have of late so huddled on his back,
[p]Enow to press a royal merchant down
[p]And pluck commiseration of his state
[p]From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
[p]From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
[p]To offices of tender courtesy.
[p]We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
"
"I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
[p]And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
[p]To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
[p]If you deny it, let the danger light
[p]Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
[p]You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
[p]A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
[p]Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
[p]But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
[p]What if my house be troubled with a rat
[p]And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
[p]To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
[p]Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
[p]Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
[p]And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
[p]Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
[p]Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
[p]Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
[p]As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
[p]Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
[p]Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
[p]Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
[p]Must yield to such inevitable shame
[p]As to offend, himself being offended;
[p]So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
[p]More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
[p]I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
[p]A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
"
"This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
[p]To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
"
"I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
"
"Do all men kill the things they do not love?
"
"Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
"
"Every offence is not a hate at first.
"
"What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
"
"I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
[p]You may as well go stand upon the beach
[p]And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
[p]You may as well use question with the wolf
[p]Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
[p]You may as well forbid the mountain pines
[p]To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
[p]When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
[p]You may as well do anything most hard,
[p]As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
[p]His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
[p]Make no more offers, use no farther means,
[p]But with all brief and plain conveniency
[p]Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
"
"For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
"
"What judgment shall I dread, doing
[p]Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
[p]I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
"
"How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
"
"What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
[p]You have among you many a purchased slave,
[p]Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
[p]You use in abject and in slavish parts,
[p]Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
[p]Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
[p]Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
[p]Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
[p]Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
[p]'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
[p]The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
[p]Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
[p]If you deny me, fie upon your law!
[p]There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
[p]I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
"
"Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
[p]Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
[p]Whom I have sent for to determine this,
[p]Come here to-day.
"
"My lord, here stays without
[p]A messenger with letters from the doctor,
[p]New come from Padua.
"
"Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
"
"Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
[p]The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
[p]Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
"
"I am a tainted wether of the flock,
[p]Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
[p]Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
[p]You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
[p]Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
"
"Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
"
"From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
"
"Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
"
"To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
"
"Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
[p]Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
[p]No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
[p]Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
"
"No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
"
"O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
[p]And for thy life let justice be accused.
[p]Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
[p]To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
[p]That souls of animals infuse themselves
[p]Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
[p]Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
[p]Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
[p]And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
[p]Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
[p]Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.
"
"Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
[p]Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
[p]Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
[p]To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
"
"This letter from Bellario doth commend
[p]A young and learned doctor to our court.
[p]Where is he?
"
"He attendeth here hard by,
[p]To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
"
"With all my heart. Some three or four of you
[p]Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
[p]Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
"
"[Reads]
[p]Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
[p]your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
[p]your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
[p]me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
[p]acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
[p]the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
[p]many books together: he is furnished with my
[p]opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
[p]greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
[p]with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
[p]request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
[p]years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
[p]estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
[p]old a head. I leave him to your gracious
[p]acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
[p]commendation.
"
"You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
[p]And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
[p][Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws]
[p]Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
"
"I did, my lord.
"
"You are welcome: take your place.
[p]Are you acquainted with the difference
[p]That holds this present question in the court?
"
"I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
[p]Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
"
"Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
"
"Is your name Shylock?
"
"Shylock is my name.
"
"Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
[p]Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
[p]Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
[p]You stand within his danger, do you not?
"
"Ay, so he says.
"
"Do you confess the bond?
"
"I do.
"
"Then must the Jew be merciful.
"
"On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
"
"The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
[p]It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
[p]Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
[p]It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
[p]'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
[p]The throned monarch better than his crown;
[p]His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
[p]The attribute to awe and majesty,
[p]Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
[p]But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
[p]It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
[p]It is an attribute to God himself;
[p]And earthly power doth then show likest God's
[p]When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
[p]Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
[p]That, in the course of justice, none of us
[p]Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
[p]And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
[p]The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
[p]To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
[p]Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
[p]Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
"
"My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
[p]The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
"
"Is he not able to discharge the money?
"
"Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
[p]Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
[p]I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
[p]On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
[p]If this will not suffice, it must appear
[p]That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
[p]Wrest once the law to your authority:
[p]To do a great right, do a little wrong,
[p]And curb this cruel devil of his will.
"
"It must not be; there is no power in Venice
[p]Can alter a decree established:
[p]'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
[p]And many an error by the same example
[p]Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
"
"A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
[p]O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
"
"I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
"
"Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
"
"Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.
"
"An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
[p]Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
[p]No, not for Venice.
"
"Why, this bond is forfeit;
[p]And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
[p]A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
[p]Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
[p]Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
"
"When it is paid according to the tenor.
[p]It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
[p]You know the law, your exposition
[p]Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
[p]Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
[p]Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
[p]There is no power in the tongue of man
[p]To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
"
"Most heartily I do beseech the court
[p]To give the judgment.
"
"Why then, thus it is:
[p]You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
"
"O noble judge! O excellent young man!
"
"For the intent and purpose of the law
[p]Hath full relation to the penalty,
[p]Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
"
"'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
[p]How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
"
"Therefore lay bare your bosom.
"
"Ay, his breast:
[p]So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
[p]'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
"
"It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
[p]The flesh?
"
"I have them ready.
"
"Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
[p]To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
"
"Is it so nominated in the bond?
"
"It is not so express'd: but what of that?
[p]'Twere good you do so much for charity.
"
"I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
"
"You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
"
"But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
[p]Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
[p]Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
[p]For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
[p]Than is her custom: it is still her use
[p]To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
[p]To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
[p]An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
[p]Of such misery doth she cut me off.
[p]Commend me to your honourable wife:
[p]Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
[p]Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
[p]And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
[p]Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
[p]Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
[p]And he repents not that he pays your debt;
[p]For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
[p]I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
"
"Antonio, I am married to a wife
[p]Which is as dear to me as life itself;
[p]But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
[p]Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
[p]I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
[p]Here to this devil, to deliver you.
"
"Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
[p]If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
"
"I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
[p]I would she were in heaven, so she could
[p]Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
"
"'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
[p]The wish would make else an unquiet house.
"
"These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
[p]Would any of the stock of Barrabas
[p]Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
[p][Aside]
[p]We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
"
"A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
[p]The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
"
"Most rightful judge!
"
"And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
[p]The law allows it, and the court awards it.
"
"Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
"
"Tarry a little; there is something else.
[p]This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
[p]The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
[p]Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
[p]But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
[p]One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
[p]Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
[p]Unto the state of Venice.
"
"O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
"
"Is that the law?
"
"Thyself shalt see the act:
[p]For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
[p]Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
"
"O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!
"
"I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
[p]And let the Christian go.
"
"Here is the money.
"
"Soft!
[p]The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
[p]He shall have nothing but the penalty.
"
"O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
"
"Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
[p]Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
[p]But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
[p]Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
[p]As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
[p]Or the division of the twentieth part
[p]Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
[p]But in the estimation of a hair,
[p]Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
"
"A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
[p]Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
"
"Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
"
"Give me my principal, and let me go.
"
"I have it ready for thee; here it is.
"
"He hath refused it in the open court:
[p]He shall have merely justice and his bond.
"
"A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
[p]I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
"
"Shall I not have barely my principal?
"
"Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
[p]To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
"
"Why, then the devil give him good of it!
[p]I'll stay no longer question.
"
"Tarry, Jew:
[p]The law hath yet another hold on you.
[p]It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
[p]If it be proved against an alien
[p]That by direct or indirect attempts
[p]He seek the life of any citizen,
[p]The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
[p]Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
[p]Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
[p]And the offender's life lies in the mercy
[p]Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
[p]In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
[p]For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
[p]That indirectly and directly too
[p]Thou hast contrived against the very life
[p]Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
[p]The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
[p]Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
"
"Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
[p]And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
[p]Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
[p]Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
"
"That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
[p]I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
[p]For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
[p]The other half comes to the general state,
[p]Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
"
"Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
"
"Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
[p]You take my house when you do take the prop
[p]That doth sustain my house; you take my life
[p]When you do take the means whereby I live.
"
"What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
"
"A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.
"
"So please my lord the duke and all the court
[p]To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
[p]I am content; so he will let me have
[p]The other half in use, to render it,
[p]Upon his death, unto the gentleman
[p]That lately stole his daughter:
[p]Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
[p]He presently become a Christian;
[p]The other, that he do record a gift,
[p]Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
[p]Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
"
"He shall do this, or else I do recant
[p]The pardon that I late pronounced here.
"
"Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?
"
"I am content.
"
"Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
"
"I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
[p]I am not well: send the deed after me,
[p]And I will sign it.
"
"Get thee gone, but do it.
"
"In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
[p]Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
[p]To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
"
"Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
"
"I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
[p]I must away this night toward Padua,
[p]And it is meet I presently set forth.
"
"I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
[p]Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
[p]For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
"
"Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
[p]Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
[p]Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
[p]Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
[p]We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
"
"And stand indebted, over and above,
[p]In love and service to you evermore.
"
"He is well paid that is well satisfied;
[p]And I, delivering you, am satisfied
[p]And therein do account myself well paid:
[p]My mind was never yet more mercenary.
[p]I pray you, know me when we meet again:
[p]I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
"
"Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
[p]Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
[p]Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
[p]Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
"
"You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
[p][To ANTONIO]
[p]Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
[p][To BASSANIO]
[p]And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
[p]Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
[p]And you in love shall not deny me this.
"
"This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
[p]I will not shame myself to give you this.
"
"I will have nothing else but only this;
[p]And now methinks I have a mind to it.
"
"There's more depends on this than on the value.
[p]The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
[p]And find it out by proclamation:
[p]Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
"
"I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
[p]You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
[p]You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
"
"Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
[p]And when she put it on, she made me vow
[p]That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
"
"That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
[p]An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
[p]And know how well I have deserved the ring,
[p]She would not hold out enemy for ever,
[p]For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
"
"My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
[p]Let his deservings and my love withal
[p]Be valued against your wife's commandment.
"
"Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
[p]Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
[p]Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
[p][Exit Gratiano]
[p]Come, you and I will thither presently;
[p]And in the morning early will we both
[p]Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.
"
"Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
[p]And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
[p]And be a day before our husbands home:
[p]This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
"
"Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
[p]My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
[p]Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
[p]Your company at dinner.
"
"That cannot be:
[p]His ring I do accept most thankfully:
[p]And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
[p]I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
"
"That will I do.
"
"Sir, I would speak with you.
[p][Aside to PORTIA]
[p]I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
[p]Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
"
"[Aside to NERISSA] Thou mayst, I warrant.
[p]We shall have old swearing
[p]That they did give the rings away to men;
[p]But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
[p][Aloud]
[p]Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.
"
"Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
"
"The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
[p]When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
[p]And they did make no noise, in such a night
[p]Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
[p]And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
[p]Where Cressid lay that night.
"
"In such a night
[p]Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
[p]And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
[p]And ran dismay'd away.
"
"In such a night
[p]Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
[p]Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
[p]To come again to Carthage.
"
"In such a night
[p]Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
[p]That did renew old AEson.
"
"In such a night
[p]Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
[p]And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
[p]As far as Belmont.
"
"In such a night
[p]Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
[p]Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
[p]And ne'er a true one.
"
"In such a night
[p]Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
[p]Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
"
"I would out-night you, did no body come;
[p]But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
"
"Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
"
"A friend.
"
"A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?
"
"Stephano is my name; and I bring word
[p]My mistress will before the break of day
[p]Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
[p]By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
[p]For happy wedlock hours.
"
"Who comes with her?
"
"None but a holy hermit and her maid.
[p]I pray you, is my master yet return'd?
"
"He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
[p]But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
[p]And ceremoniously let us prepare
[p]Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
"
"Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
"
"Who calls?
"
"Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
[p]Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!
"
"Leave hollaing, man: here.
"
"Sola! where? where?
"
"Here.
"
"Tell him there's a post come from my master, with
[p]his horn full of good news: my master will be here
[p]ere morning.
"
"Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
[p]And yet no matter: why should we go in?
[p]My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
[p]Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
[p]And bring your music forth into the air.
[p][Exit Stephano]
[p]How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
[p]Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
[p]Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
[p]Become the touches of sweet harmony.
[p]Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
[p]Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
[p]There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
[p]But in his motion like an angel sings,
[p]Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
[p]Such harmony is in immortal souls;
[p]But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
[p]Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
[p][Enter Musicians]
[p]Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
[p]With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
[p]And draw her home with music.
"
"I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
"
"The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
[p]For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
[p]Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
[p]Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
[p]Which is the hot condition of their blood;
[p]If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
[p]Or any air of music touch their ears,
[p]You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
[p]Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
[p]By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
[p]Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
[p]Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
[p]But music for the time doth change his nature.
[p]The man that hath no music in himself,
[p]Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
[p]Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
[p]The motions of his spirit are dull as night
[p]And his affections dark as Erebus:
[p]Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
"
"That light we see is burning in my hall.
[p]How far that little candle throws his beams!
[p]So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
"
"When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
"
"So doth the greater glory dim the less:
[p]A substitute shines brightly as a king
[p]Unto the king be by, and then his state
[p]Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
[p]Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
"
"It is your music, madam, of the house.
"
"Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
[p]Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
"
"Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
"
"The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
[p]When neither is attended, and I think
[p]The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
[p]When every goose is cackling, would be thought
[p]No better a musician than the wren.
[p]How many things by season season'd are
[p]To their right praise and true perfection!
[p]Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
[p]And would not be awaked.
"
"That is the voice,
[p]Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
"
"He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
[p]By the bad voice.
"
"Dear lady, welcome home.
"
"We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
[p]Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
[p]Are they return'd?
"
"Madam, they are not yet;
[p]But there is come a messenger before,
[p]To signify their coming.
"
"Go in, Nerissa;
[p]Give order to my servants that they take
[p]No note at all of our being absent hence;
[p]Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
"
"Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
[p]We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.
"
"This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
[p]It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
[p]Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
[p][Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and]
[p]their followers]
"
"We should hold day with the Antipodes,
[p]If you would walk in absence of the sun.
"
"Let me give light, but let me not be light;
[p]For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
[p]And never be Bassanio so for me:
[p]But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
"
"I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
[p]This is the man, this is Antonio,
[p]To whom I am so infinitely bound.
"
"You should in all sense be much bound to him.
[p]For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
"
"No more than I am well acquitted of.
"
"Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
[p]It must appear in other ways than words,
[p]Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
"
"[To NERISSA] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
[p]In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
[p]Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
[p]Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
"
"A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?
"
"About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
[p]That she did give me, whose posy was
[p]For all the world like cutler's poetry
[p]Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
"
"What talk you of the posy or the value?
[p]You swore to me, when I did give it you,
[p]That you would wear it till your hour of death
[p]And that it should lie with you in your grave:
[p]Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
[p]You should have been respective and have kept it.
[p]Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
[p]The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
"
"He will, an if he live to be a man.
"
"Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
"
"Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
[p]A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
[p]No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
[p]A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
[p]I could not for my heart deny it him.
"
"You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
[p]To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
[p]A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
[p]And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
[p]I gave my love a ring and made him swear
[p]Never to part with it; and here he stands;
[p]I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
[p]Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
[p]That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
[p]You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
[p]An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
"
"[Aside] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
[p]And swear I lost the ring defending it.
"
"My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
[p]Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
[p]Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
[p]That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
[p]And neither man nor master would take aught
[p]But the two rings.
"
"What ring gave you my lord?
[p]Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
"
"If I could add a lie unto a fault,
[p]I would deny it; but you see my finger
[p]Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
"
"Even so void is your false heart of truth.
[p]By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
[p]Until I see the ring.
"
"Nor I in yours
[p]Till I again see mine.
"
"Sweet Portia,
[p]If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
[p]If you did know for whom I gave the ring
[p]And would conceive for what I gave the ring
[p]And how unwillingly I left the ring,
[p]When nought would be accepted but the ring,
[p]You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
"
"If you had known the virtue of the ring,
[p]Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
[p]Or your own honour to contain the ring,
[p]You would not then have parted with the ring.
[p]What man is there so much unreasonable,
[p]If you had pleased to have defended it
[p]With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
[p]To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
[p]Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
[p]I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
"
"No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
[p]No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
[p]Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
[p]And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
[p]And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
[p]Even he that did uphold the very life
[p]Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
[p]I was enforced to send it after him;
[p]I was beset with shame and courtesy;
[p]My honour would not let ingratitude
[p]So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
[p]For, by these blessed candles of the night,
[p]Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
[p]The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
"
"Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
[p]Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
[p]And that which you did swear to keep for me,
[p]I will become as liberal as you;
[p]I'll not deny him any thing I have,
[p]No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
[p]Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
[p]Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
[p]If you do not, if I be left alone,
[p]Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
[p]I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
"
"And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
[p]How you do leave me to mine own protection.
"
"Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
[p]For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
"
"I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
"
"Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.
"
"Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
[p]And, in the hearing of these many friends,
[p]I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
[p]Wherein I see myself--
"
"Mark you but that!
[p]In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
[p]In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
[p]And there's an oath of credit.
"
"Nay, but hear me:
[p]Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
[p]I never more will break an oath with thee.
"
"I once did lend my body for his wealth;
[p]Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
[p]Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
[p]My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
[p]Will never more break faith advisedly.
"
"Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
[p]And bid him keep it better than the other.
"
"Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.
"
"By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
"
"I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
[p]For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
"
"And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
[p]For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
[p]In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
"
"Why, this is like the mending of highways
[p]In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
[p]What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
"
"Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
[p]Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
[p]It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
[p]There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
[p]Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
[p]Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
[p]And even but now return'd; I have not yet
[p]Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
[p]And I have better news in store for you
[p]Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
[p]There you shall find three of your argosies
[p]Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
[p]You shall not know by what strange accident
[p]I chanced on this letter.
"
"I am dumb.
"
"Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
"
"Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
"
"Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
[p]Unless he live until he be a man.
"
"Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
[p]When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
"
"Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
[p]For here I read for certain that my ships
[p]Are safely come to road.
"
"How now, Lorenzo!
[p]My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
"
"Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
[p]There do I give to you and Jessica,
[p]From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
[p]After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
"
"Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
[p]Of starved people.
"
"It is almost morning,
[p]And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
[p]Of these events at full. Let us go in;
[p]And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
[p]And we will answer all things faithfully.
"
"Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
[p]That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
[p]Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
[p]Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
[p]But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
[p]That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
[p]Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
[p]So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
"
"Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-
[p]chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John
[p]Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.
"
"In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and
[p]'Coram.'
"
"Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.
"
"Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born,
[p]master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any
[p]bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'
"
"Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
[p]hundred years.
"
"All his successors gone before him hath done't; and
[p]all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
[p]give the dozen white luces in their coat.
"
"It is an old coat.
"
"The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;
[p]it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
[p]man, and signifies love.
"
"The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.
"
"I may quarter, coz.
"
"You may, by marrying.
"
"It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.
"
"Not a whit.
"
"Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,
[p]there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
[p]simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
[p]John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
[p]you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
[p]benevolence to make atonements and compremises
[p]between you.
"
"The council shall bear it; it is a riot.
"
"It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no
[p]fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
[p]desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a
[p]riot; take your vizaments in that.
"
"Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword
[p]should end it.
"
"It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it:
[p]and there is also another device in my prain, which
[p]peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
[p]is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
[p]Page, which is pretty virginity.
"
"Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
[p]small like a woman.
"
"It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as
[p]you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,
[p]and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
[p]death's-bed--Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
[p]--give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years
[p]old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
[p]and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master
[p]Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.
"
"Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?
"
"Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.
"
"I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.
"
"Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts.
"
"Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?
"
"Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
[p]despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
[p]is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
[p]beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
[p]peat the door for Master Page.
[p][Knocks]
[p]What, hoa! Got pless your house here!
"
"[Within] Who's there?
"
"Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice
[p]Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that
[p]peradventures shall tell you another tale, if
[p]matters grow to your likings.
"
"I am glad to see your worships well.
[p]I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.
"
"Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it
[p]your good heart! I wished your venison better; it
[p]was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?--and I
[p]thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.
"
"Sir, I thank you.
"
"Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.
"
"I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.
"
"How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he
[p]was outrun on Cotsall.
"
"It could not be judged, sir.
"
"You'll not confess, you'll not confess.
"
"That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault;
[p]'tis a good dog.
"
"A cur, sir.
"
"Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be
[p]more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
[p]Falstaff here?
"
"Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good
[p]office between you.
"
"It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.
"
"He hath wronged me, Master Page.
"
"Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.
"
"If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that
[p]so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
[p]hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
[p]Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.
"
"Here comes Sir John.
"
"Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?
"
"Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and
[p]broke open my lodge.
"
"But not kissed your keeper's daughter?
"
"Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.
"
"I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
[p]That is now answered.
"
"The council shall know this.
"
"'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:
[p]you'll be laughed at.
"
"Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.
"
"Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
[p]head: what matter have you against me?
"
"Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;
[p]and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
[p]Nym, and Pistol.
"
"You Banbury cheese!
"
"Ay, it is no matter.
"
"How now, Mephostophilus!
"
"Ay, it is no matter.
"
"Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.
"
"Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?
"
"Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
[p]three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that
[p]is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
[p]myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
[p]lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.
"
"We three, to hear it and end it between them.
"
"Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-
[p]book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
[p]as great discreetly as we can.
"
"Pistol!
"
"He hears with ears.
"
"The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He
[p]hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.
"
"Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?
"
"Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might
[p]never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
[p]seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
[p]shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
[p]pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
"
"Is this true, Pistol?
"
"No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.
"
"Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,
[p]I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
[p]Word of denial in thy labras here!
[p]Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!
"
"By these gloves, then, 'twas he.
"
"Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say
[p]'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
[p]humour on me; that is the very note of it.
"
"By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
[p]though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
[p]drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.
"
"What say you, Scarlet and John?
"
"Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
[p]himself out of his five sentences.
"
"It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!
"
"And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and
[p]so conclusions passed the careires.
"
"Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no
[p]matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,
[p]but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
[p]if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have
[p]the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.
"
"So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.
"
"You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.
[p][Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD]
[p]and MISTRESS PAGE, following]
"
"Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.
"
"O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.
"
"How now, Mistress Ford!
"
"Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:
[p]by your leave, good mistress.
"
"Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
[p]hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
[p]we shall drink down all unkindness.
"
"I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
[p]Songs and Sonnets here.
[p][Enter SIMPLE]
[p]How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait
[p]on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
[p]about you, have you?
"
"Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
[p]Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
[p]afore Michaelmas?
"
"Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with
[p]you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
[p]tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
[p]here. Do you understand me?
"
"Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,
[p]I shall do that that is reason.
"
"Nay, but understand me.
"
"So I do, sir.
"
"Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will
[p]description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
"
"Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray
[p]you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his
[p]country, simple though I stand here.
"
"But that is not the question: the question is
[p]concerning your marriage.
"
"Ay, there's the point, sir.
"
"Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.
"
"Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
[p]reasonable demands.
"
"But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to
[p]know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
[p]philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
[p]mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
[p]good will to the maid?
"
"Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
"
"I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
[p]would do reason.
"
"Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak
[p]possitable, if you can carry her your desires
[p]towards her.
"
"That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?
"
"I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
[p]request, cousin, in any reason.
"
"Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do
[p]is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?
"
"I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
[p]be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
[p]decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
[p]married and have more occasion to know one another;
[p]I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:
[p]but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that
[p]I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.
"
"It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in
[p]the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our
[p]meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.
"
"Ay, I think my cousin meant well.
"
"Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!
"
"Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
[p][Re-enter ANNE PAGE]
[p]Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!
"
"The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
[p]worships' company.
"
"I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.
"
"Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.
"
"Will't please your worship to come in, sir?
"
"No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.
"
"The dinner attends you, sir.
"
"I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
[p]sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my
[p]cousin Shallow.
[p][Exit SIMPLE]
[p]A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his
[p]friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
[p]yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I
[p]live like a poor gentleman born.
"
"I may not go in without your worship: they will not
[p]sit till you come.
"
"I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as
[p]though I did.
"
"I pray you, sir, walk in.
"
"I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
[p]my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
[p]dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
[p]dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot
[p]abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
[p]dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?
"
"I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.
"
"I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at
[p]it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
[p]the bear loose, are you not?
"
"Ay, indeed, sir.
"
"That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen
[p]Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
[p]the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so
[p]cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
[p]indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored
[p]rough things.
"
"Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.
"
"I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.
"
"By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.
"
"Nay, pray you, lead the way.
"
"Come on, sir.
"
"Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
"
"Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.
"
"I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
[p]You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!
"
"Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which
[p]is the way: and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,
[p]which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry
[p]nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and
[p]his wringer.
"
"Well, sir.
"
"Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it
[p]is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
[p]Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire
[p]and require her to solicit your master's desires to
[p]Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
[p]make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come.
"
"Mine host of the Garter!
"
"What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.
"
"Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
[p]followers.
"
"Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.
"
"I sit at ten pounds a week.
"
"Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I
[p]will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall
[p]tap: said I well, bully Hector?
"
"Do so, good mine host.
"
"I have spoke; let him follow.
[p][To BARDOLPH]
[p]Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.
"
"Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:
[p]an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered
[p]serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.
"
"It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.
"
"O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?
"
"He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?
"
"I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his
[p]thefts were too open; his filching was like an
[p]unskilful singer; he kept not time.
"
"The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.
"
"'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico
[p]for the phrase!
"
"Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.
"
"Why, then, let kibes ensue.
"
"There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.
"
"Young ravens must have food.
"
"Which of you know Ford of this town?
"
"I ken the wight: he is of substance good.
"
"My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.
"
"Two yards, and more.
"
"No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
[p]yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
[p]thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
[p]wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
[p]she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
[p]can construe the action of her familiar style; and
[p]the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
[p]rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'
"
"He hath studied her will, and translated her will,
[p]out of honesty into English.
"
"The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?
"
"Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
[p]husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.
"
"As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.
"
"The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.
"
"I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
[p]another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
[p]eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
[p]oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
[p]foot, sometimes my portly belly.
"
"Then did the sun on dunghill shine.
"
"I thank thee for that humour.
"
"O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
[p]greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
[p]seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's
[p]another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
[p]is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
[p]be cheater to them both, and they shall be
[p]exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
[p]Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
[p]this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to
[p]Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.
"
"Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
[p]And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!
"
"I will run no base humour: here, take the
[p]humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.
"
"[To ROBIN] Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;
[p]Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
[p]Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;
[p]Trudge, plod away o' the hoof; seek shelter, pack!
[p]Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,
[p]French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.
"
"Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
[p]And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:
[p]Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
[p]Base Phrygian Turk!
"
"I have operations which be humours of revenge.
"
"Wilt thou revenge?
"
"By welkin and her star!
"
"With wit or steel?
"
"With both the humours, I:
[p]I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.
"
"And I to Ford shall eke unfold
[p]How Falstaff, varlet vile,
[p]His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
[p]And his soft couch defile.
"
"My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to
[p]deal with poison; I will possess him with
[p]yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous:
[p]that is my true humour.
"
"Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee; troop on.
"
"What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,
[p]and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor
[p]Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any
[p]body in the house, here will be an old abusing of
[p]God's patience and the king's English.
"
"I'll go watch.
"
"Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in
[p]faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.

[p]that way: but nobody but has his fault; but let
[p]that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?
"
"Ay, for fault of a better.
"
"And Master Slender's your master?
"
"Ay, forsooth.
"
"Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
[p]glover's paring-knife?
"
"No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a
[p]little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.
"
"A softly-sprighted man, is he not?
"
"Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands
[p]as any is between this and his head; he hath fought
[p]with a warrener.
"
"How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not
[p]hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?
"
"Yes, indeed, does he.

"Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.

[p]I am glad he went not in himself: if he had found

"What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is

"
"I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth

"
"Vell.
"
"Ay, forsooth; to desire her to--

"Peace, I pray you.
"
"Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.
"
"To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to

"
"Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.

"
"[Aside to SIMPLE] I am glad he is so quiet: if he

[p]scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds and do
[p]all myself,--
"
"[Aside to MISTRESS QUICKLY] 'Tis a great charge to
[p]come under one body's hand.
"
"[Aside to SIMPLE] Are you avised o' that? you
[p]shall find it a great charge: and to be up early
[p]and down late; but notwithstanding,--to tell you in
[p]your ear; I would have no words of it,--my master
[p]himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but
[p]notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,--that's
[p]neither here nor there.
"
"You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by
[p]gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in dee
[p]park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest
[p]to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good
[p]you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two
[p]stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw
[p]at his dog:
"
"Alas, he speaks but for his friend.
"
"It is no matter-a ver dat: do not you tell-a me
[p]dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I
[p]vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine
[p]host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I
[p]will myself have Anne Page.
"
"Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We
[p]must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!
"
"Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have
[p]not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my
[p]door. Follow my heels, Rugby.
"
"You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I
[p]know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor
[p]knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more
[p]than I do with her, I thank heaven.
"
"[Within] Who's within there? ho!
"
"Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.
"
"How now, good woman? how dost thou?
"
"The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.
"
"What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?
"
"In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and
[p]gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you
[p]that by the way; I praise heaven for it.
"
"Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?
"
"Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
[p]notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a
[p]book, she loves you. Have not your worship a wart
[p]above your eye?
"
"Yes, marry, have I; what of that?
"
"Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
[p]another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever
[p]broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I
[p]shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But
[p]indeed she is given too much to allicholy and
[p]musing: but for you--well, go to.
"
"Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money
[p]for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if
[p]thou seest her before me, commend me.
"
"Will I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your
[p]worship more of the wart the next time we have
[p]confidence; and of other wooers.
"
"Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.
"
"Farewell to your worship.
[p][Exit FENTON]
[p]Truly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not;
[p]for I know Anne's mind as well as another does. Out
[p]upon't! what have I forgot?
"
"What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-
[p]time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
[p]Let me see.
[p][Reads]
[p]'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though
[p]Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
[p]not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
[p]am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,
[p]so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you
[p]love sack, and so do I; would you desire better
[p]sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at
[p]the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--
[p]that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis
[p]not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,
[p]Thine own true knight,
[p]By day or night,
[p]Or any kind of light,
[p]With all his might
[p]For thee to fight, JOHN FALSTAFF'
[p]What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
[p]world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
[p]age to show himself a young gallant! What an
[p]unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
[p]picked--with the devil's name!--out of my
[p]conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
[p]Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
[p]should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
[p]mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill
[p]in the parliament for the putting down of men. How
[p]shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,
[p]as sure as his guts are made of puddings.
"
"Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.
"
"And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very
[p]ill.
"
"Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.
"
"Faith, but you do, in my mind.
"
"Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the
[p]contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!
"
"What's the matter, woman?
"
"O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I
[p]could come to such honour!
"
"Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is
[p]it? dispense with trifles; what is it?
"
"If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,
[p]I could be knighted.
"
"What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights
[p]will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the
[p]article of thy gentry.
"
"We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I
[p]might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
[p]men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of
[p]men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
[p]women's modesty; and gave such orderly and
[p]well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I
[p]would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
[p]the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere
[p]and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to
[p]the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
[p]threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
[p]belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged
[p]on him? I think the best way were to entertain him
[p]with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted
[p]him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?
"
"Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and
[p]Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery
[p]of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy
[p]letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I
[p]protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a
[p]thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
[p]different names--sure, more,--and these are of the
[p]second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;
[p]for he cares not what he puts into the press, when
[p]he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,
[p]and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you
[p]twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.
"
"Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very
[p]words. What doth he think of us?
"
"Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to
[p]wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain
[p]myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;
[p]for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I
[p]know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.
"
"'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him
[p]above deck.
"
"So will I. if he come under my hatches, I'll never
[p]to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's
[p]appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in
[p]his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,
[p]till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.
"
"Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,
[p]that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,
[p]that my husband saw this letter! it would give
[p]eternal food to his jealousy.
"
"Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's
[p]as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;
[p]and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.
"
"You are the happier woman.
"
"Let's consult together against this greasy knight.
[p]Come hither.
"
"Well, I hope it be not so.
"
"Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:
[p]Sir John affects thy wife.
"
"Why, sir, my wife is not young.
"
"He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,
[p]Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
[p]He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.
"
"Love my wife!
"
"With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
[p]Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:
[p]O, odious is the name!
"
"What name, sir?
"
"The horn, I say. Farewell.
[p]Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:
[p]Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.
[p]Away, Sir Corporal Nym!
[p]Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.
"
"[Aside] I will be patient; I will find out this.
"
"[To PAGE] And this is true; I like not the humour
[p]of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I
[p]should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I
[p]have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.
[p]He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.
[p]My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis
[p]true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.
[p]Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,
[p]and there's the humour of it. Adieu.
"
"'The humour of it,' quoth a'! here's a fellow
[p]frights English out of his wits.
"
"I will seek out Falstaff.
"
"I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.
"
"If I do find it: well.
"
"I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest
[p]o' the town commended him for a true man.
"
"'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.
"
"How now, Meg!
"
"Whither go you, George? Hark you.
"
"How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy?
"
"I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.
"
"Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,
[p]will you go, Mistress Page?
"
"Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George.
[p][Aside to MISTRESS FORD]
[p]Look who comes yonder: she shall be our messenger
[p]to this paltry knight.
"
"[Aside to MISTRESS PAGE] Trust me, I thought on her:
[p]she'll fit it.
"
"You are come to see my daughter Anne?
"
"Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?
"
"Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with
[p]you.
"
"How now, Master Ford!
"
"You heard what this knave told me, did you not?
"
"Yes: and you heard what the other told me?
"
"Do you think there is truth in them?
"
"Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
[p]offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent
[p]towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men;
[p]very rogues, now they be out of service.
"
"Were they his men?
"
"Marry, were they.
"
"I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at
[p]the Garter?
"
"Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage
[p]towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and
[p]what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it
[p]lie on my head.
"
"I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to
[p]turn them together. A man may be too confident: I
[p]would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.
"
"Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes:
[p]there is either liquor in his pate or money in his
[p]purse when he looks so merrily.
[p][Enter Host]
[p]How now, mine host!
"
"How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.
[p]Cavaleiro-justice, I say!
"
"I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
[p]twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go
[p]with us? we have sport in hand.
"
"Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.
"
"Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
[p]the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.
"
"Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.
"
"What sayest thou, my bully-rook?
"
"[To PAGE] Will you go with us to behold it? My
[p]merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons;
[p]and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places;
[p]for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.
[p]Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.
"
"Hast thou no suit against my knight, my
[p]guest-cavaleire?
"
"None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of
[p]burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him
[p]my name is Brook; only for a jest.
"
"My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;
[p]--said I well?--and thy name shall be Brook. It is
[p]a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?
"
"Have with you, mine host.
"
"I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in
[p]his rapier.
"
"Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times
[p]you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and
[p]I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis
[p]here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long
[p]sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.
"
"Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?
"
"Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.
"
"Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly
[p]on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my
[p]opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's
[p]house; and what they made there, I know not. Well,
[p]I will look further into't: and I have a disguise
[p]to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not
[p]my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.
"
"I will not lend thee a penny.
"
"Why, then the world's mine oyster.
[p]Which I with sword will open.
"
"Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should
[p]lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my
[p]good friends for three reprieves for you and your
[p]coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through
[p]the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in
[p]hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were
[p]good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress
[p]Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon
[p]mine honour thou hadst it not.
"
"Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?
"
"Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
[p]endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more
[p]about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife
[p]and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.
[p]You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you
[p]stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable
[p]baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the
[p]terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself
[p]sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand
[p]and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to
[p]shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,
[p]will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain
[p]looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your
[p]bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your
[p]honour! You will not do it, you!
"
"I do relent: what would thou more of man?
"
"Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
"
"Let her approach.
"
"Give your worship good morrow.
"
"Good morrow, good wife.
"
"Not so, an't please your worship.
"
"Good maid, then.
"
"I'll be sworn,
[p]As my mother was, the first hour I was born.
"
"I do believe the swearer. What with me?
"
"Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
"
"Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee
[p]the hearing.
"
"There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a
[p]little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master
[p]Doctor Caius,--
"
"Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--
"
"Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,
[p]come a little nearer this ways.
"
"I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine
[p]own people.
"
"Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!
"
"Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?
"
"Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your
[p]worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all
[p]of us, I pray!
"
"Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--
"
"Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you
[p]have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis
[p]wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the
[p]court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
[p]to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
[p]lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
[p]you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
[p]after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
[p]rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
[p]such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
[p]the best and the fairest, that would have won any
[p]woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
[p]get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
[p]given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
[p]any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
[p]honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
[p]her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
[p]them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which
[p]is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.
"
"But what says she to me? be brief, my good
[p]she-Mercury.
"
"Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which
[p]she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
[p]to notify that her husband will be absence from his
[p]house between ten and eleven.
"
"Ten and eleven?
"
"Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the
[p]picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,
[p]her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet
[p]woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very
[p]jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with
[p]him, good heart.
"
"Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will
[p]not fail her.
"
"Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to
[p]your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
[p]commendations to you too: and let me tell you in
[p]your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and
[p]one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor
[p]evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the
[p]other: and she bade me tell your worship that her
[p]husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there
[p]will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon
[p]a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.
"
"Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my
[p]good parts aside I have no other charms.
"
"Blessing on your heart for't!
"
"But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and
[p]Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?
"
"That were a jest indeed! they have not so little
[p]grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
[p]Mistress Page would desire you to send her your
[p]little page, of all loves: her husband has a
[p]marvellous infection to the little page; and truly
[p]Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
[p]Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what
[p]she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go
[p]to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as
[p]she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there
[p]be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must
[p]send her your page; no remedy.
"
"Why, I will.
"
"Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and
[p]go between you both; and in any case have a
[p]nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and
[p]the boy never need to understand any thing; for
[p]'tis not good that children should know any
[p]wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,
[p]as they say, and know the world.
"
"Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's
[p]my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
[p]this woman.
[p][Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBIN]
[p]This news distracts me!
"
"This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:
[p]Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
[p]Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!
"
"Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
[p]more of thy old body than I have done. Will they
[p]yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense
[p]of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I
[p]thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be
[p]fairly done, no matter.
"
"Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain
[p]speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
[p]sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
"
"Brook is his name?
"
"Ay, sir.
"
"Call him in.
[p][Exit BARDOLPH]
[p]Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such
[p]liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page
[p]have I encompassed you? go to; via!
"
"Bless you, sir!
"
"And you, sir! Would you speak with me?
"
"I make bold to press with so little preparation upon
[p]you.
"
"You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.
"
"Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.
"
"Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.
"
"Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;
[p]for I must let you understand I think myself in
[p]better plight for a lender than you are: the which
[p]hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned
[p]intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all
[p]ways do lie open.
"
"Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.
"
"Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:
[p]if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or
[p]half, for easing me of the carriage.
"
"Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.
"
"I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.
"
"Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
[p]your servant.
"
"Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief
[p]with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,
[p]though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
[p]myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
[p]thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
[p]own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
[p]one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
[p]turn another into the register of your own; that I
[p]may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
[p]yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.
"
"Very well, sir; proceed.
"
"There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's
[p]name is Ford.
"
"Well, sir.
"
"I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,
[p]bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting
[p]observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;
[p]fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
[p]give me sight of her; not only bought many presents
[p]to give her, but have given largely to many to know
[p]what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued
[p]her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the
[p]wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
[p]merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
[p]I am sure, I have received none; unless experience
[p]be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
[p]rate, and that hath taught me to say this:
[p]'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
[p]Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'
"
"Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?
"
"Never.
"
"Have you importuned her to such a purpose?
"
"Never.
"
"Of what quality was your love, then?
"
"Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
[p]that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
[p]where I erected it.
"
"To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
"
"When I have told you that, I have told you all.
[p]Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
[p]other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
[p]there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
[p]John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
[p]gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
[p]discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
[p]place and person, generally allowed for your many
[p]war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.
"
"O, sir!
"
"Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend
[p]it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only
[p]give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
[p]to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
[p]Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
[p]consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
[p]any.
"
"Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
[p]affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
[p]Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
"
"O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on
[p]the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my
[p]soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
[p]be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
[p]with any detection in my hand, my desires had
[p]instance and argument to commend themselves: I
[p]could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
[p]her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
[p]other her defences, which now are too too strongly
[p]embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?
"
"Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
[p]money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
[p]gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
"
"O good sir!
"
"I say you shall.
"
"Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
"
"Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want
[p]none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
[p]own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
[p]assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
[p]shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
[p]that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
[p]will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
[p]know how I speed.
"
"I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
[p]sir?
"
"Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:
[p]yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
[p]jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
[p]which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
[p]use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
[p]and there's my harvest-home.
"
"I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
[p]if you saw him.
"
"Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
[p]stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
[p]cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
[p]cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
[p]will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
[p]lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
[p]Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
[p]thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
[p]cuckold. Come to me soon at night.
"
"What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
[p]ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
[p]improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the
[p]hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
[p]have thought this? See the hell of having a false
[p]woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
[p]ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not
[p]only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under
[p]the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
[p]does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
[p]well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
[p]devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
[p]Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath
[p]not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
[p]will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
[p]rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
[p]the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
[p]aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
[p]gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,
[p]then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they
[p]think in their hearts they may effect, they will
[p]break their hearts but they will effect. God be
[p]praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
[p]I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
[p]Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;
[p]better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
[p]Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!
"
"Jack Rugby!
"
"Sir?
"
"Vat is de clock, Jack?
"
"'Tis past the hour, sir, that Sir Hugh promised to meet.
"
"By gar, he has save his soul, dat he is no come; he
[p]has pray his Pible well, dat he is no come: by gar,
[p]Jack Rugby, he is dead already, if he be come.
"
"He is wise, sir; he knew your worship would kill
[p]him, if he came.
"
"By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill kill him.
[p]Take your rapier, Jack; I vill tell you how I vill kill him.
"
"Alas, sir, I cannot fence.
"
"Villany, take your rapier.
"
"Forbear; here's company.
"
"Bless thee, bully doctor!
"
"Save you, Master Doctor Caius!
"
"Now, good master doctor!
"
"Give you good morrow, sir.
"
"Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
"
"To see thee fight, to see thee foin, to see thee

"
"By gar, he is de coward Jack priest of de vorld; he

"Thou art a Castalion-King-Urinal. Hector of Greece, my boy!
"
"I pray you, bear vitness that me have stay six or
[p]seven, two, tree hours for him, and he is no come.
"
"He is the wiser man, master doctor: he is a curer of
[p]souls, and you a curer of bodies; if you should
[p]fight, you go against the hair of your professions.
[p]Is it not true, Master Page?
"
"Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great
[p]fighter, though now a man of peace.
"
"Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old and of
[p]the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to
[p]make one. Though we are justices and doctors and
[p]churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our
[p]youth in us; we are the sons of women, Master Page.
"
"'Tis true, Master Shallow.
"
"It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor
[p]Caius, I am come to fetch you home. I am sworn of
[p]the peace: you have showed yourself a wise
[p]physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself a wise
[p]and patient churchman. You must go with me, master doctor.
"
"Pardon, guest-justice. A word, Mounseur Mockwater.
"
"Mock-vater! vat is dat?
"
"Mock-water, in our English tongue, is valour, bully.
"
"By gar, den, I have as mush mock-vater as de
[p]Englishman. Scurvy jack-dog priest! by gar, me
[p]vill cut his ears.
"
"He will clapper-claw thee tightly, bully.
"
"Clapper-de-claw! vat is dat?
"
"That is, he will make thee amends.
"
"By gar, me do look he shall clapper-de-claw me;
[p]for, by gar, me vill have it.
"
"And I will provoke him to't, or let him wag.
"
"Me tank you for dat.
"
"And, moreover, bully,--but first, master guest, and
[p]Master Page, and eke Cavaleiro Slender, go you
[p]through the town to Frogmore.
"
"Sir Hugh is there, is he?
"
"He is there: see what humour he is in; and I will
[p]bring the doctor about by the fields. Will it do well?
"
"We will do it.
"
"[with Shallow and Slender] Adieu, good master doctor.
"
"By gar, me vill kill de priest; for he speak for a
[p]jack-an-ape to Anne Page.
"
"Let him die: sheathe thy impatience, throw cold
[p]water on thy choler: go about the fields with me
[p]through Frogmore: I will bring thee where Mistress
[p]Anne Page is, at a farm-house a-feasting; and thou
[p]shalt woo her. Cried I aim? said I well?
"
"By gar, me dank you for dat: by gar, I love you;
[p]and I shall procure-a you de good guest, de earl,

"For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne
[p]Page. Said I well?
"
"By gar, 'tis good; vell said.
"
"Let us wag, then.
"
"Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.
"
"I pray you now, good master Slender's serving-man,
[p]and friend Simple by your name, which way have you
[p]looked for Master Caius, that calls himself doctor of physic?
"
"Marry, sir, the pittie-ward, the park-ward, every
[p]way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town
[p]way.

"I most fehemently desire you you will also look that
[p]way.
"
"I will, sir.
"
"'Pless my soul, how full of chollors I am, and

"
"He's welcome.
[p][Sings]
[p]To shallow rivers, to whose falls-
[p]Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?
"
"No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master
[p]Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over
[p]the stile, this way.
"
"Pray you, give me my gown; or else keep it in your arms.
"
"How now, master Parson! Good morrow, good Sir Hugh.
[p]Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student
[p]from his book, and it is wonderful.
"
"[Aside] Ah, sweet Anne Page!
"
"'Save you, good Sir Hugh!
"
"'Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!
"
"What, the sword and the word! do you study them
[p]both, master parson?
"
"And youthful still! in your doublet and hose this
[p]raw rheumatic day!
"
"There is reasons and causes for it.
"
"We are come to you to do a good office, master parson.
"
"Fery well: what is it?
"
"Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike
[p]having received wrong by some person, is at most
[p]odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you
[p]saw.
"
"I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never
[p]heard a man of his place, gravity and learning, so
[p]wide of his own respect.
"
"What is he?
"
"I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the
[p]renowned French physician.
"
"Got's will, and his passion of my heart! I had as
[p]lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.
"
"Why?
"
"He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and Galen,
[p]--and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as you
[p]would desires to be acquainted withal.
"
"I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.
"
"[Aside] O sweet Anne Page!
"
"It appears so by his weapons. Keep them asunder:
[p]here comes Doctor Caius.
"
"Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon.
"
"So do you, good master doctor.
"
"Disarm them, and let them question: let them keep
[p]their limbs whole and hack our English.
"
"I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear.
[p]Vherefore vill you not meet-a me?
"
"[Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS] Pray you, use your patience:
[p]in good time.
"
"By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.
"
"[Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS] Pray you let us not be
[p]laughing-stocks to other men's humours; I desire you
[p]in friendship, and I will one way or other make you amends.
[p][Aloud]
[p]I will knog your urinals about your knave's cockscomb
[p]for missing your meetings and appointments.
"
"Diable! Jack Rugby,--mine host de Jarteer,--have I
[p]not stay for him to kill him? have I not, at de place
[p]I did appoint?
"
"As I am a Christians soul now, look you, this is the
[p]place appointed: I'll be judgement by mine host of
[p]the Garter.
"
"Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh,
[p]soul-curer and body-curer!
"
"Ay, dat is very good; excellent.
"
"Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am I
[p]politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I
[p]lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the
[p]motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir
[p]Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the
[p]no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me
[p]thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have
[p]deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong
[p]places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are
[p]whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay
[p]their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace;
[p]follow, follow, follow.
"
"Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow.
"
"[Aside] O sweet Anne Page!
"
"Ha, do I perceive dat? have you make-a de sot of
[p]us, ha, ha?
"
"This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. I
[p]desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog
[p]our prains together to be revenge on this same
[p]scall, scurvy cogging companion, the host of the Garter.
"
"By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me
[p]where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.
"
"Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you, follow.
"
"Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to
[p]be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether
[p]had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?
"
"I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man
[p]than follow him like a dwarf.
"
"O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you'll be a courtier.
"
"Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?
"
"Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?
"
"Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want
[p]of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,
[p]you two would marry.
"
"Be sure of that,--two other husbands.
"
"Where had you this pretty weather-cock?
"
"I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my
[p]husband had him of. What do you call your knight's
[p]name, sirrah?
"
"Sir John Falstaff.
"
"Sir John Falstaff!
"
"He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such a
[p]league between my good man and he! Is your wife at
[p]home indeed?
"
"Indeed she is.
"
"By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.
"
"Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any
[p]thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
[p]Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as
[p]easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve
[p]score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he
[p]gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's
[p]going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A
[p]man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And
[p]Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;
[p]and our revolted wives share damnation together.
[p]Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
[p]the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming
[p]Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and
[p]wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all
[p]my neighbours shall cry aim.
[p][Clock heard]
[p]The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me
[p]search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be
[p]rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as
[p]positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
[p]there: I will go.
[p][Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, Host,]
[p]SIR HUGH EVANS, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY]
"
"[with Page and others] Well met, Master Ford.
"
"Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;
[p]and I pray you all go with me.
"
"I must excuse myself, Master Ford.
"
"And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with
[p]Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for
[p]more money than I'll speak of.
"
"We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and
[p]my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.
"
"I hope I have your good will, father Page.
"
"You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:
[p]but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.
"
"Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a
[p]Quickly tell me so mush.
"
"What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he
[p]dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he
[p]speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will
[p]carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he
[p]will carry't.
"
"Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is
[p]of no having: he kept company with the wild prince
[p]and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too
[p]much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes
[p]with the finger of my substance: if he take her,
[p]let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on
[p]my consent, and my consent goes not that way.
"
"I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me
[p]to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have
[p]sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,
[p]you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.
"
"Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing
[p]at Master Page's.
"
"Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.
"
"Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight
[p]Falstaff, and drink canary with him.
"
"[Aside] I think I shall drink in pipe wine first
[p]with him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?
"
"Have with you to see this monster.
"
"What, John! What, Robert!
"
"Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket--
"
"I warrant. What, Robin, I say!
"
"Come, come, come.
"
"Here, set it down.
"
"Give your men the charge; we must be brief.
"
"Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be
[p]ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I
[p]suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause
[p]or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:
[p]that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry
[p]it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there
[p]empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.
"
"You will do it?
"
"I ha' told them over and over; they lack no
[p]direction. Be gone, and come when you are called.
"
"Here comes little Robin.
"
"How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?
"
"My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,
[p]Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
"
"You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?
"
"Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
[p]being here and hath threatened to put me into
[p]everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he
[p]swears he'll turn me away.
"
"Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be
[p]a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet
[p]and hose. I'll go hide me.
"
"Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.
[p][Exit ROBIN]
[p]Mistress Page, remember you your cue.
"
"I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.
"
"Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,
[p]this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know
[p]turtles from jays.
"
"Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let
[p]me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the
[p]period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!
"
"O sweet Sir John!
"
"Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
[p]Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
[p]thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the
[p]best lord; I would make thee my lady.
"
"I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!
"
"Let the court of France show me such another. I see
[p]how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast
[p]the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
[p]ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
[p]Venetian admittance.
"
"A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing
[p]else; nor that well neither.
"
"By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou
[p]wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm
[p]fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion
[p]to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
[p]what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature
[p]thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.
"
"Believe me, there is no such thing in me.
"
"What made me love thee? let that persuade thee
[p]there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I
[p]cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a
[p]many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like
[p]women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury
[p]in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none
[p]but thee; and thou deservest it.
"
"Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.
"
"Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the
[p]Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek
[p]of a lime-kiln.
"
"Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one
[p]day find it.
"
"Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.
"
"Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not
[p]be in that mind.
"
"[Within] Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's
[p]Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and
[p]looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.
"
"She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.
"
"Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.
[p][FALSTAFF hides himself]
[p][Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN]
[p]What's the matter? how now!
"
"O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
[p]you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!
"
"What's the matter, good Mistress Page?
"
"O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man
[p]to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!
"
"What cause of suspicion?
"
"What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I
[p]mistook in you!
"
"Why, alas, what's the matter?
"
"Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the
[p]officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that
[p]he says is here now in the house by your consent, to
[p]take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.
"
"'Tis not so, I hope.
"
"Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man
[p]here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,
[p]with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a
[p]one. I come before to tell you. If you know
[p]yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you
[p]have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not
[p]amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your
[p]reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.
"
"What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear
[p]friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his
[p]peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were
[p]out of the house.
"
"For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you
[p]had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink
[p]you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot
[p]hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here
[p]is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he
[p]may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as
[p]if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time
[p]--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.
"
"He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?
"
"[Coming forward] Let me see't, let me see't, O, let
[p]me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
[p]counsel. I'll in.
"
"What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?
"
"I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.
[p]I'll never--
"
"Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,
[p]Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!
"
"What, John! Robert! John!
[p][Exit ROBIN]
[p][Re-enter Servants]
[p]Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where's the
[p]cowl-staff? look, how you drumble! Carry them to
[p]the laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.
"
"Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,
[p]why then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;
[p]I deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?
"
"To the laundress, forsooth.
"
"Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You
[p]were best meddle with buck-washing.
"
"Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!
[p]Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;
[p]and of the season too, it shall appear.
[p][Exeunt Servants with the basket]
[p]Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my
[p]dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my
[p]chambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant
[p]we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.
[p][Locking the door]
[p]So, now uncape.
"
"Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.
"
"True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see
[p]sport anon: follow me, gentlemen.
"
"This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.
"
"By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not
[p]jealous in France.
"
"Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.
"
"Is there not a double excellency in this?
"
"I know not which pleases me better, that my husband
[p]is deceived, or Sir John.
"
"What a taking was he in when your husband asked who
[p]was in the basket!
"
"I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so
[p]throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.
"
"Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same
[p]strain were in the same distress.
"
"I think my husband hath some special suspicion of
[p]Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross
[p]in his jealousy till now.
"
"I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have
[p]more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will
[p]scarce obey this medicine.
"
"Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
[p]Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the
[p]water; and give him another hope, to betray him to
[p]another punishment?
"
"We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,
[p]eight o'clock, to have amends.
"
"I cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that
[p]he could not compass.
"
"[Aside to MISTRESS FORD] Heard you that?
"
"You use me well, Master Ford, do you?
"
"Ay, I do so.
"
"Heaven make you better than your thoughts!
"
"Amen!
"
"You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.
"
"Ay, ay; I must bear it.
"
"If there be any pody in the house, and in the
[p]chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,
[p]heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!
"
"By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.
"
"Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What
[p]spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I
[p]would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the
[p]wealth of Windsor Castle.
"
"'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.
"
"You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as
[p]honest a 'omans as I will desires among five
[p]thousand, and five hundred too.
"
"By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.
"
"Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in
[p]the Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter
[p]make known to you why I have done this. Come,
[p]wife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;
[p]pray heartily, pardon me.
"
"Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock
[p]him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house
[p]to breakfast: after, we'll a-birding together; I
[p]have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?
"
"Any thing.
"
"If there is one, I shall make two in the company.
"
"If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.
"
"Pray you, go, Master Page.
"
"I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy
[p]knave, mine host.
"
"Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!
"
"A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!
"
"I see I cannot get thy father's love;
[p]Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
"
"Alas, how then?
"
"Why, thou must be thyself.
[p]He doth object I am too great of birth--,
[p]And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
[p]I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
[p]Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
[p]My riots past, my wild societies;
[p]And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
[p]I should love thee but as a property.
"
"May be he tells you true.
"
"No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
[p]Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
[p]Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
[p]Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
[p]Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
[p]And 'tis the very riches of thyself
[p]That now I aim at.
"
"Gentle Master Fenton,
[p]Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:
[p]If opportunity and humblest suit
[p]Cannot attain it, why, then,--hark you hither!
"
"Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman shall
[p]speak for himself.
"
"I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but
[p]venturing.
"
"Be not dismayed.
"
"No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that,
[p]but that I am afeard.
"
"Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.
"
"I come to him.
[p][Aside]
[p]This is my father's choice.
[p]O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults
[p]Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!
"
"And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.
"
"She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!
"
"I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you
[p]good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress
[p]Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of
[p]a pen, good uncle.
"
"Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.
"
"Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in
[p]Gloucestershire.
"
"He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
"
"Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the
[p]degree of a squire.
"
"He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.
"
"Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.
"
"Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good
[p]comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.
"
"Now, Master Slender,--
"
"Now, good Mistress Anne,--
"
"What is your will?
"
"My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
[p]indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I
[p]am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.
"
"I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
"
"Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing
[p]with you. Your father and my uncle hath made
[p]motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be
[p]his dole! They can tell you how things go better
[p]than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes.
"
"Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
[p]Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?
[p]You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
[p]I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.
"
"Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.
"
"Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
"
"She is no match for you.
"
"Sir, will you hear me?
"
"No, good Master Fenton.
[p]Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
[p]Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
"
"Speak to Mistress Page.
"
"Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
[p]In such a righteous fashion as I do,
[p]Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,
[p]I must advance the colours of my love
[p]And not retire: let me have your good will.
"
"Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
"
"I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.
"
"That's my master, master doctor.
"
"Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth
[p]And bowl'd to death with turnips!
"
"Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
[p]I will not be your friend nor enemy:
[p]My daughter will I question how she loves you,
[p]And as I find her, so am I affected.
[p]Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;
[p]Her father will be angry.
"
"Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.
"
"This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast
[p]away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on
[p]Master Fenton:' this is my doing.
"
"I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
[p]Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.
"
"Now heaven send thee good fortune!
[p][Exit FENTON]
[p]A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through
[p]fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
[p]would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would
[p]Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master
[p]Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all
[p]three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good
[p]as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
[p]I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
[p]my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!
"
"Bardolph, I say,--
"
"Here, sir.
"
"Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.
[p][Exit BARDOLPH]
[p]Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a
[p]barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the
[p]Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,
[p]I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
[p]them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues
[p]slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
[p]they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,
[p]fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size
[p]that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the
[p]bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had
[p]been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and
[p]shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells
[p]a man; and what a thing should I have been when I
[p]had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.
"
"Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.
"
"Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my
[p]belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for
[p]pills to cool the reins. Call her in.
"
"Come in, woman!
"
"By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship
[p]good morrow.
"
"Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of
[p]sack finely.
"
"With eggs, sir?
"
"Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.
[p][Exit BARDOLPH]
[p]How now!
"
"Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.
"
"Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown
[p]into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.
"
"Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:
[p]she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.
"
"So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.
"
"Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn
[p]your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning
[p]a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her
[p]between eight and nine: I must carry her word
[p]quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.
"
"Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her
[p]think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,
[p]and then judge of my merit.
"
"I will tell her.
"
"Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?
"
"Eight and nine, sir.
"
"Well, be gone: I will not miss her.
"
"Peace be with you, sir.
"
"I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word
[p]to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.
"
"Bless you, sir!
"
"Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed
[p]between me and Ford's wife?
"
"That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.
"
"Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her
[p]house the hour she appointed me.
"
"And sped you, sir?
"
"Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
"
"How so, sir? Did she change her determination?
"
"No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her
[p]husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
[p]'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
[p]encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
[p]and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
[p]and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
[p]provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
[p]forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.
"
"What, while you were there?
"
"While I was there.
"
"And did he search for you, and could not find you?
"
"You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
[p]in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's
[p]approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's
[p]distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.
"
"A buck-basket!
"
"By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul
[p]shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
[p]napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
[p]compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.
"
"And how long lay you there?
"
"Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
[p]suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
[p]Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
[p]knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
[p]mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
[p]Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
[p]the jealous knave their master in the door, who
[p]asked them once or twice what they had in their
[p]basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
[p]would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
[p]should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
[p]for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
[p]mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
[p]of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
[p]fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
[p]bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
[p]bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
[p]point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
[p]like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
[p]that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a
[p]man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject
[p]to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
[p]and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
[p]And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
[p]half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
[p]thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
[p]in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
[p]that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.
"
"In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you
[p]have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;
[p]you'll undertake her no more?
"
"Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have
[p]been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
[p]husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
[p]received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt
[p]eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
"
"'Tis past eight already, sir.
"
"Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
[p]Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
[p]know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
[p]crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
[p]have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall
[p]cuckold Ford.
"
"Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I
[p]sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!
[p]there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
[p]This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen
[p]and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
[p]what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my
[p]house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he
[p]should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
[p]nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
[p]guides him should aid him, I will search
[p]impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
[p]yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:
[p]if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
[p]with me: I'll be horn-mad.
"
"Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?
"
"Sure he is by this, or will be presently: but,
[p]truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing
[p]into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.
"
"I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my young
[p]man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
[p]'tis a playing-day, I see.
[p][Enter SIR HUGH EVANS]
[p]How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day?
"
"No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.
"
"Blessing of his heart!
"
"Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in
[p]the world at his book. I pray you, ask him some
[p]questions in his accidence.
"
"Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.
"
"Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your
[p]master, be not afraid.
"
"William, how many numbers is in nouns?
"
"Two.
"
"Truly, I thought there had been one number more,
[p]because they say, 'Od's nouns.'
"
"Peace your tattlings! What is 'fair,' William?
"
"Pulcher.
"
"Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats, sure.
"
"You are a very simplicity 'oman: I pray you peace.
[p]What is 'lapis,' William?
"
"A stone.
"
"And what is 'a stone,' William?
"
"A pebble.
"
"No, it is 'lapis:' I pray you, remember in your prain.
"
"Lapis.
"
"That is a good William. What is he, William, that
[p]does lend articles?
"
"Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus
[p]declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.
"
"Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark:
[p]genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?
"
"Accusativo, hinc.
"
"I pray you, have your remembrance, child,
[p]accusative, hung, hang, hog.
"
"'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.
"
"Leave your prabbles, 'oman. What is the focative
[p]case, William?
"
"O,--vocativo, O.
"
"Remember, William; focative is caret.
"
"And that's a good root.
"
"'Oman, forbear.
"
"Peace!
"
"What is your genitive case plural, William?
"
"Genitive case!
"
"Ay.
"
"Genitive,--horum, harum, horum.
"
"Vengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her! never name
[p]her, child, if she be a whore.
"
"For shame, 'oman.
"
"You do ill to teach the child such words: he
[p]teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do
[p]fast enough of themselves, and to call 'horum:' fie upon you!
"
"'Oman, art thou lunatics? hast thou no
[p]understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the
[p]genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as
[p]I would desires.
"
"Prithee, hold thy peace.
"
"Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.
"
"Forsooth, I have forgot.
"
"It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your 'quies,'
[p]your 'quaes,' and your 'quods,' you must be
[p]preeches. Go your ways, and play; go.
"
"He is a better scholar than I thought he was.
"
"He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.
"
"Adieu, good Sir Hugh.
[p][Exit SIR HUGH EVANS]
[p]Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.
"
"Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
[p]sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
[p]and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not
[p]only, Mistress Ford, in the simple
[p]office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
[p]complement and ceremony of it. But are you
[p]sure of your husband now?
"
"He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.
"
"[Within] What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!
"
"Step into the chamber, Sir John.
"
"How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?
"
"Why, none but mine own people.
"
"Indeed!
"
"No, certainly.
[p][Aside to her]
[p]Speak louder.
"
"Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.
"
"Why?
"
"Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:
[p]he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
[p]against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's
[p]daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets
[p]himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer
[p]out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
[p]tameness, civility and patience, to this his
[p]distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.
"
"Why, does he talk of him?
"
"Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the
[p]last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests
[p]to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
[p]the rest of their company from their sport, to make
[p]another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad
[p]the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.
"
"How near is he, Mistress Page?
"
"Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.
"
"I am undone! The knight is here.
"
"Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead
[p]man. What a woman are you!--Away with him, away
[p]with him! better shame than murder.
"
"Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?
[p]Shall I put him into the basket again?
"
"No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go
[p]out ere he come?
"
"Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door
[p]with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise
[p]you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?
"
"What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.
"
"There they always use to discharge their
[p]birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.
"
"Where is it?
"
"He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
[p]coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
[p]abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
[p]goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.
"
"I'll go out then.
"
"If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir
[p]John. Unless you go out disguised--
"
"How might we disguise him?
"
"Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown
[p]big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
[p]a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.
"
"Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather
[p]than a mischief.
"
"My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a
[p]gown above.
"
"On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he
[p]is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler
[p]too. Run up, Sir John.
"
"Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will
[p]look some linen for your head.
"
"Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put
[p]on the gown the while.
"
"I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he
[p]cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears
[p]she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath
[p]threatened to beat her.
"
"Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the
[p]devil guide his cudgel afterwards!
"
"But is my husband coming?
"
"Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket
[p]too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.
"
"We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the
[p]basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as
[p]they did last time.
"
"Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him
[p]like the witch of Brentford.
"
"I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the
[p]basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.
"
"Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.
[p]We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
[p]Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:
[p]We do not act that often jest and laugh;
[p]'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.
"
"Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders:
[p]your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it
[p]down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.
"
"Come, come, take it up.
"
"Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.
"
"I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.
"
"Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any
[p]way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,
[p]villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!
[p]O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a
[p]pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil
[p]be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!
[p]Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!
"
"Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go
[p]loose any longer; you must be pinioned.
"
"Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!
"
"Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.
"
"So say I too, sir.
[p][Re-enter MISTRESS FORD]
[p]Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest
[p]woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that
[p]hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect
[p]without cause, mistress, do I?
"
"Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in
[p]any dishonesty.
"
"Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!
"
"This passes!
"
"Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.
"
"I shall find you anon.
"
"'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's
[p]clothes? Come away.
"
"Empty the basket, I say!
"
"Why, man, why?
"
"Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed
[p]out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
[p]not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:
[p]my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
[p]Pluck me out all the linen.
"
"If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.
"
"Here's no man.
"
"By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this
[p]wrongs you.
"
"Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the
[p]imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.
"
"Well, he's not here I seek for.
"
"No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.
"
"Help to search my house this one time. If I find
[p]not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let
[p]me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of
[p]me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
[p]walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;
[p]once more search with me.
"
"What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old woman
[p]down; my husband will come into the chamber.
"
"Old woman! what old woman's that?
"
"Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.
"
"A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not
[p]forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does
[p]she? We are simple men; we do not know what's
[p]brought to pass under the profession of
[p]fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,
[p]by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond
[p]our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,
[p]you hag, you; come down, I say!
"
"Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him
[p]not strike the old woman.
"
"Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.
"
"I'll prat her.
[p][Beating him]
[p]Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you
[p]polecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,
[p]I'll fortune-tell you.
"
"Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the
[p]poor woman.
"
"Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.
"
"Hang her, witch!
"
"By the yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch
[p]indeed: I like not when a 'oman has a great peard;
[p]I spy a great peard under his muffler.
"
"Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;
[p]see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus
[p]upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.
"
"Let's obey his humour a little further: come,
[p]gentlemen.
"
"Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.
"
"Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him most
[p]unpitifully, methought.
"
"I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the
[p]altar; it hath done meritorious service.
"
"What think you? may we, with the warrant of
[p]womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,
[p]pursue him with any further revenge?
"
"The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of
[p]him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with
[p]fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the
[p]way of waste, attempt us again.
"
"Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?
"
"Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the
[p]figures out of your husband's brains. If they can
[p]find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight
[p]shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be
[p]the ministers.
"
"I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and
[p]methinks there would be no period to the jest,
[p]should he not be publicly shamed.
"
"Come, to the forge with it then; shape it: I would
[p]not have things cool.
"
"Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
[p]horses: the duke himself will be to-morrow at
[p]court, and they are going to meet him.
"
"What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear
[p]not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
[p]gentlemen: they speak English?
"
"Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.
"
"They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;
[p]I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at
[p]command; I have turned away my other guests: they
[p]must come off; I'll sauce them. Come.
"
"'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever
[p]I did look upon.
"
"And did he send you both these letters at an instant?
"
"Within a quarter of an hour.
"
"Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
[p]I rather will suspect the sun with cold
[p]Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand
[p]In him that was of late an heretic,
[p]As firm as faith.
"
"'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:
[p]Be not as extreme in submission
[p]As in offence.
[p]But let our plot go forward: let our wives
[p]Yet once again, to make us public sport,
[p]Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
[p]Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.
"
"There is no better way than that they spoke of.
"
"How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park
[p]at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.
"
"You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
[p]been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks
[p]there should be terrors in him that he should not
[p]come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have
[p]no desires.
"
"So think I too.
"
"Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
[p]And let us two devise to bring him thither.
"
"There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
[p]Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
[p]Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
[p]Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
[p]And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
[p]And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
[p]In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
[p]You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
[p]The superstitious idle-headed eld
[p]Received and did deliver to our age
[p]This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.
"
"Why, yet there want not many that do fear
[p]In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:
[p]But what of this?
"
"Marry, this is our device;
[p]That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.
"
"Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:
[p]And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
[p]What shall be done with him? what is your plot?
"
"That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
[p]Nan Page my daughter and my little son
[p]And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
[p]Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
[p]With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
[p]And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
[p]As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
[p]Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
[p]With some diffused song: upon their sight,
[p]We two in great amazedness will fly:
[p]Then let them all encircle him about
[p]And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,
[p]And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
[p]In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
[p]In shape profane.
"
"And till he tell the truth,
[p]Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
[p]And burn him with their tapers.
"
"The truth being known,
[p]We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
[p]And mock him home to Windsor.
"
"The children must
[p]Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.
"
"I will teach the children their behaviors; and I
[p]will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the
[p]knight with my taber.
"
"That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.
"
"My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
[p]Finely attired in a robe of white.
"
"That silk will I go buy.
[p][Aside]
[p]And in that time
[p]Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
[p]And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.
"
"Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
[p]He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.
"
"Fear not you that. Go get us properties
[p]And tricking for our fairies.
"
"Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery
[p]honest knaveries.
"
"Go, Mistress Ford,
[p]Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
[p][Exit MISTRESS FORD]
[p]I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,
[p]And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
[p]That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
[p]And he my husband best of all affects.
[p]The doctor is well money'd, and his friends
[p]Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,
[p]Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.
"
"What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin?
[p]speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.
"
"Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
[p]from Master Slender.
"
"There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
[p]standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about
[p]with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go
[p]knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian
[p]unto thee: knock, I say.
"
"There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his
[p]chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come
[p]down; I come to speak with her, indeed.
"
"Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll
[p]call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
[p]thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine
[p]host, thine Ephesian, calls.
"
"[Above] How now, mine host!
"
"Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of
[p]thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her
[p]descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?
[p]fie!
"
"There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with
[p]me; but she's gone.
"
"Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
[p]Brentford?
"
"Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?
"
"My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing
[p]her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
[p]one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the
[p]chain or no.
"
"I spake with the old woman about it.
"
"And what says she, I pray, sir?
"
"Marry, she says that the very same man that
[p]beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of
[p]it.
"
"I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;
[p]I had other things to have spoken with her too from
[p]him.
"
"What are they? let us know.
"
"Ay, come; quick.
"
"I may not conceal them, sir.
"
"Conceal them, or thou diest.
"
"Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne
[p]Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to
[p]have her or no.
"
"'Tis, 'tis his fortune.
"
"What, sir?
"
"To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.
"
"May I be bold to say so, sir?
"
"Ay, sir; like who more bold.
"
"I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad
[p]with these tidings.
"
"Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was
[p]there a wise woman with thee?
"
"Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught
[p]me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;
[p]and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for
[p]my learning.
"
"Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!
"
"Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.
"
"Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came
[p]beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
[p]them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,
[p]like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.
"
"They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not
[p]say they be fled; Germans are honest men.
"
"Where is mine host?
"
"What is the matter, sir?
"
"Have a care of your entertainments: there is a
[p]friend of mine come to town tells me there is three
[p]cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of
[p]Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and
[p]money. I tell you for good will, look you: you
[p]are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and
[p]'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.
"
"Vere is mine host de Jarteer?
"
"Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.
"
"I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat
[p]you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by
[p]my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to
[p]come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.
"
"Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am
[p]undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!
"
"I would all the world might be cozened; for I have
[p]been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
[p]the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
[p]and how my transformation hath been washed and
[p]cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
[p]drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant
[p]they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
[p]as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
[p]since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my
[p]wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.
[p][Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]
[p]Now, whence come you?
"
"From the two parties, forsooth.
"
"The devil take one party and his dam the other! and
[p]so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more
[p]for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy
[p]of man's disposition is able to bear.
"
"And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;
[p]speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,
[p]is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a
[p]white spot about her.
"
"What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
[p]beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;
[p]and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
[p]Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,
[p]my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
[p]delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the
[p]stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.
"
"Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you
[p]shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your
[p]content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good
[p]hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!
[p]Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that
[p]you are so crossed.
"
"Come up into my chamber.
"
"Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I
[p]will give over all.
"
"Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
[p]And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
[p]A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
"
"I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the
[p]least keep your counsel.
"
"From time to time I have acquainted you
[p]With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
[p]Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
[p]So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
[p]Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
[p]Of such contents as you will wonder at;
[p]The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
[p]That neither singly can be manifested,
[p]Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
[p]Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
[p]I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
[p]To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
[p]Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
[p]The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
[p]While other jests are something rank on foot,
[p]Her father hath commanded her to slip
[p]Away with Slender and with him at Eton
[p]Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
[p]Her mother, ever strong against that match
[p]And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
[p]That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
[p]While other sports are tasking of their minds,
[p]And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
[p]Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
[p]She seemingly obedient likewise hath
[p]Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
[p]Her father means she shall be all in white,
[p]And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
[p]To take her by the hand and bid her go,
[p]She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
[p]The better to denote her to the doctor,
[p]For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
[p]That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
[p]With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
[p]And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
[p]To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
[p]The maid hath given consent to go with him.
"
"Which means she to deceive, father or mother?
"
"Both, my good host, to go along with me:
[p]And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
[p]To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
[p]And, in the lawful name of marrying,
[p]To give our hearts united ceremony.
"
"Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:
[p]Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.
"
"So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
[p]Besides, I'll make a present recompense.
"
"Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is
[p]the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
[p]numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in
[p]odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!
"
"I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to
[p]get you a pair of horns.
"
"Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.
[p][Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY]
[p][Enter FORD]
[p]How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter
[p]will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the
[p]Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall
[p]see wonders.
"
"Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me
[p]you had appointed?
"
"I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor
[p]old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a
[p]poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,
[p]hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,
[p]Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
[p]you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
[p]woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear
[p]not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know
[p]also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along
[p]with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I
[p]plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew
[p]not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow
[p]me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave
[p]Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I
[p]will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.
[p]Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.
"
"Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we
[p]see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender,
[p]my daughter.
"
"Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a
[p]nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in
[p]white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by
[p]that we know one another.
"
"That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'
[p]or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well
[p]enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.
"
"The night is dark; light and spirits will become it
[p]well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil
[p]but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.
[p]Let's away; follow me.
"
"Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you
[p]see your time, take her by the band, away with her
[p]to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before
[p]into the Park: we two must go together.
"
"I know vat I have to do. Adieu.
"
"Fare you well, sir.
[p][Exit DOCTOR CAIUS]
[p]My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of
[p]Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying
[p]my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little
[p]chiding than a great deal of heart-break.
"
"Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the
[p]Welsh devil Hugh?
"
"They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,
[p]with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of
[p]Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once
[p]display to the night.
"
"That cannot choose but amaze him.
"
"If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be
[p]amazed, he will every way be mocked.
"
"We'll betray him finely.
"
"Against such lewdsters and their lechery
[p]Those that betray them do no treachery.
"
"The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!
"
"Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts:
[p]be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and
[p]when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid you:
[p]come, come; trib, trib.
"
"The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute
[p]draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!
[p]Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love
[p]set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some
[p]respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man
[p]a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love
[p]of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew
[p]to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in
[p]the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And
[p]then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think
[p]on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot
[p]backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
[p]Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the
[p]forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can
[p]blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my
[p]doe?
"
"Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?
"
"My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
[p]potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green
[p]Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let
[p]there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.
"
"Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.
"
"Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will
[p]keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow
[p]of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.
[p]Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?
[p]Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes
[p]restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!
"
"Alas, what noise?
"
"Heaven forgive our sins
"
"What should this be?
"
"[with Mistress Page] Away, away!
"
"I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the
[p]oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would
[p]never else cross me thus.

"Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.

[p]And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
[p]In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;
[p]Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,
[p]Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:
[p]Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
[p]Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
[p]Our dance of custom round about the oak
[p]Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.
"
"Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set
[p]And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
[p]To guide our measure round about the tree.
[p]But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.
"
"Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
[p]transform me to a piece of cheese!
"
"Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.
"
"With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:
[p]If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
[p]And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
[p]It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.
"
"A trial, come.
"
"Come, will this wood take fire?
"
"Oh, Oh, Oh!
"
"Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
[p]About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
[p]And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
[p]SONG.
[p]Fie on sinful fantasy!
[p]Fie on lust and luxury!
[p]Lust is but a bloody fire,
[p]Kindled with unchaste desire,
[p]Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
[p]As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
[p]Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
[p]Pinch him for his villany;
[p]Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
[p]Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.
[p][During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS]
[p]comes one way, and steals away a boy in green;
[p]SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white;
[p]and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.
[p]A noise of hunting is heard within. All the
[p]Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's
[p]head, and rises]
"
"Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now
[p]Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?
"
"I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher
[p]Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
[p]See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
[p]Become the forest better than the town?
"
"Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
[p]Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his
[p]horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
[p]enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his
[p]cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be
[p]paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for
[p]it, Master Brook.
"
"Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.
[p]I will never take you for my love again; but I will
[p]always count you my deer.
"
"I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
"
"Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.
"
"And these are not fairies? I was three or four
[p]times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
[p]the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
[p]powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
[p]received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
[p]rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
[p]how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon
[p]ill employment!
"
"Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your
[p]desires, and fairies will not pinse you.
"
"Well said, fairy Hugh.
"
"And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.
"
"I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
[p]able to woo her in good English.
"
"Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that
[p]it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
[p]this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
[p]have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
[p]with a piece of toasted cheese.
"
"Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.
"
"'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
[p]taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
[p]is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
[p]through the realm.
"
"Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the
[p]virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
[p]and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
[p]that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
"
"What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?
"
"A puffed man?
"
"Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?
"
"And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
"
"And as poor as Job?
"
"And as wicked as his wife?
"
"And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack
[p]and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and
[p]swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
"
"Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I
[p]am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
[p]flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use
[p]me as you will.
"
"Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one
[p]Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to
[p]whom you should have been a pander: over and above
[p]that you have suffered, I think to repay that money
[p]will be a biting affliction.
"
"Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset
[p]to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to
[p]laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her
[p]Master Slender hath married her daughter.
"
"[Aside] Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my
[p]daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.
"
"Whoa ho! ho, father Page!
"
"Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?
"
"Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire
[p]know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.
"
"Of what, son?
"
"I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,
[p]and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been
[p]i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he
[p]should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
[p]been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis
[p]a postmaster's boy.
"
"Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
"
"What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took
[p]a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for
[p]all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had
[p]him.
"
"Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how
[p]you should know my daughter by her garments?
"
"I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she
[p]cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet
[p]it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
"
"Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;
[p]turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is
[p]now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.
"
"Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'
[p]married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;
[p]it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.
"
"Why, did you take her in green?
"
"Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.
"
"This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?
"
"My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.
[p][Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE]
[p]How now, Master Fenton!
"
"Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!
"
"Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?
"
"Why went you not with master doctor, maid?
"
"You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
[p]You would have married her most shamefully,
[p]Where there was no proportion held in love.
[p]The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
[p]Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
[p]The offence is holy that she hath committed;
[p]And this deceit loses the name of craft,
[p]Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
[p]Since therein she doth evitate and shun
[p]A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
[p]Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.
"
"Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:
[p]In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;
[p]Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.
"
"I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to
[p]strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.
"
"Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
[p]What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.
"
"When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.
"
"Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
[p]Heaven give you many, many merry days!
[p]Good husband, let us every one go home,
[p]And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
[p]Sir John and all.
"
"Let it be so. Sir John,
[p]To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
[p]For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
"
"Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
[p]Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
[p]Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
[p]This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
[p]Like to a step-dame or a dowager
[p]Long withering out a young man revenue.
"
"Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
[p]Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
[p]And then the moon, like to a silver bow
[p]New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
[p]Of our solemnities.
"
"Go, Philostrate,
[p]Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
[p]Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
[p]Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
[p]The pale companion is not for our pomp.
[p][Exit PHILOSTRATE]
[p]Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
[p]And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
[p]But I will wed thee in another key,
[p]With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
"
"Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
"
"Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
"
"Full of vexation come I, with complaint
[p]Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
[p]Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
[p]This man hath my consent to marry her.
[p]Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
[p]This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
[p]Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
[p]And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
[p]Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
[p]With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
[p]And stolen the impression of her fantasy
[p]With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
[p]Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
[p]Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
[p]With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
[p]Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
[p]To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
[p]Be it so she; will not here before your grace
[p]Consent to marry with Demetrius,
[p]I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
[p]As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
[p]Which shall be either to this gentleman
[p]Or to her death, according to our law
[p]Immediately provided in that case.
"
"What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
[p]To you your father should be as a god;
[p]One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
[p]To whom you are but as a form in wax
[p]By him imprinted and within his power
[p]To leave the figure or disfigure it.
[p]Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
"
"So is Lysander.
"
"In himself he is;
[p]But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
[p]The other must be held the worthier.
"
"I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
"
"Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
"
"I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
[p]I know not by what power I am made bold,
[p]Nor how it may concern my modesty,
[p]In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
[p]But I beseech your grace that I may know
[p]The worst that may befall me in this case,
[p]If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
"
"Either to die the death or to abjure
[p]For ever the society of men.
[p]Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
[p]Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
[p]Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
[p]You can endure the livery of a nun,
[p]For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
[p]To live a barren sister all your life,
[p]Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
[p]Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
[p]To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
[p]But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
[p]Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
[p]Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
"
"So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
[p]Ere I will my virgin patent up
[p]Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
[p]My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
"
"Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
[p]The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
[p]For everlasting bond of fellowship--
[p]Upon that day either prepare to die
[p]For disobedience to your father's will,
[p]Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
[p]Or on Diana's altar to protest
[p]For aye austerity and single life.
"
"Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
[p]Thy crazed title to my certain right.
"
"You have her father's love, Demetrius;
[p]Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
"
"Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
[p]And what is mine my love shall render him.
[p]And she is mine, and all my right of her
[p]I do estate unto Demetrius.
"
"I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
[p]As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
[p]My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
[p]If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
[p]And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
[p]I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
[p]Why should not I then prosecute my right?
[p]Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
[p]Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
[p]And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
[p]Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
[p]Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
"
"I must confess that I have heard so much,
[p]And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
[p]But, being over-full of self-affairs,
[p]My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
[p]And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
[p]I have some private schooling for you both.
[p]For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
[p]To fit your fancies to your father's will;
[p]Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
[p]Which by no means we may extenuate--
[p]To death, or to a vow of single life.
[p]Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
[p]Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
[p]I must employ you in some business
[p]Against our nuptial and confer with you
[p]Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
"
"With duty and desire we follow you.
"
"How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
[p]How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
"
"Belike for want of rain, which I could well
[p]Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
"
"Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
[p]Could ever hear by tale or history,
[p]The course of true love never did run smooth;
[p]But, either it was different in blood,--
"
"O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
"
"Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
"
"O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
"
"Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
"
"O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
"
"Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
[p]War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
[p]Making it momentany as a sound,
[p]Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
[p]Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
[p]That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
[p]And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
[p]The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
[p]So quick bright things come to confusion.
"
"If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
[p]It stands as an edict in destiny:
[p]Then let us teach our trial patience,
[p]Because it is a customary cross,
[p]As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
[p]Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
"
"A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
[p]I have a widow aunt, a dowager
[p]Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
[p]From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
[p]And she respects me as her only son.
[p]There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
[p]And to that place the sharp Athenian law
[p]Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
[p]Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
[p]And in the wood, a league without the town,
[p]Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
[p]To do observance to a morn of May,
[p]There will I stay for thee.
"
"My good Lysander!
[p]I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
[p]By his best arrow with the golden head,
[p]By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
[p]By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
[p]And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
[p]When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
[p]By all the vows that ever men have broke,
[p]In number more than ever women spoke,
[p]In that same place thou hast appointed me,
[p]To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
"
"Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
"
"God speed fair Helena! whither away?
"
"Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
[p]Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
[p]Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
[p]More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
[p]When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
[p]Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
[p]Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
[p]My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
[p]My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
[p]Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
[p]The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
[p]O, teach me how you look, and with what art
[p]You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
"
"I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
"
"O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
"
"I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
"
"O that my prayers could such affection move!
"
"The more I hate, the more he follows me.
"
"The more I love, the more he hateth me.
"
"His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
"
"None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
"
"Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
[p]Lysander and myself will fly this place.
[p]Before the time I did Lysander see,
[p]Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
[p]O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
[p]That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
"
"Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
[p]To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
[p]Her silver visage in the watery glass,
[p]Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
[p]A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
[p]Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
"
"And in the wood, where often you and I
[p]Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
[p]Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
[p]There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
[p]And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
[p]To seek new friends and stranger companies.
[p]Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
[p]And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
[p]Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
[p]From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
"
"I will, my Hermia.
[p][Exit HERMIA]
[p]Helena, adieu:
[p]As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
"
"How happy some o'er other some can be!
[p]Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
[p]But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
[p]He will not know what all but he do know:
[p]And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
[p]So I, admiring of his qualities:
[p]Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
[p]Love can transpose to form and dignity:
[p]Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
[p]And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
[p]Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
[p]Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
[p]And therefore is Love said to be a child,
[p]Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
[p]As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
[p]So the boy Love is perjured every where:
[p]For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
[p]He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
[p]And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
[p]So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
[p]I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
[p]Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
[p]Pursue her; and for this intelligence
[p]If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
[p]But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
[p]To have his sight thither and back again.
"
"Is all our company here?
"
"You were best to call them generally, man by man,
[p]according to the scrip.
"
"Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
[p]thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
[p]interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
[p]wedding-day at night.
"
"First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
[p]on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
[p]to a point.
"
"Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
[p]most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
"
"A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
[p]merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
[p]actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
"
"Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
"
"Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
"
"You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
"
"What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
"
"A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
"
"That will ask some tears in the true performing of
[p]it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
[p]eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
[p]measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
[p]tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
[p]tear a cat in, to make all split.
[p]The raging rocks
[p]And shivering shocks
[p]Shall break the locks
[p]Of prison gates;
[p]And Phibbus' car
[p]Shall shine from far
[p]And make and mar
[p]The foolish Fates.
[p]This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
[p]This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
[p]more condoling.
"
"Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
"
"Here, Peter Quince.
"
"Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
"
"What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
"
"It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
"
"Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.
"
"That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
[p]you may speak as small as you will.
"
"An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
[p]speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
[p]Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
[p]and lady dear!'
"
"No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.
"
"Well, proceed.
"
"Robin Starveling, the tailor.
"
"Here, Peter Quince.
"
"Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
[p]Tom Snout, the tinker.
"
"Here, Peter Quince.
"
"You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
[p]Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
[p]hope, here is a play fitted.
"
"Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
[p]be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
"
"You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
"
"Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
[p]do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
[p]that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
[p]let him roar again.'
"
"An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
[p]the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
[p]and that were enough to hang us all.
"
"That would hang us, every mother's son.
"
"I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
[p]ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
[p]discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
[p]voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
[p]sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
[p]nightingale.
"
"You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
[p]sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
[p]summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
[p]therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
"
"Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
[p]to play it in?
"
"Why, what you will.
"
"I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
[p]beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
[p]beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
[p]perfect yellow.
"
"Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
[p]then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
[p]are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
[p]you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
[p]and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
[p]town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
[p]we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
[p]company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
[p]will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
[p]wants. I pray you, fail me not.
"
"We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
[p]obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.
"
"At the duke's oak we meet.
"
"Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.
"
"How now, spirit! whither wander you?
"
"Over hill, over dale,
[p]Thorough bush, thorough brier,
[p]Over park, over pale,
[p]Thorough flood, thorough fire,
[p]I do wander everywhere,
[p]Swifter than the moon's sphere;
[p]And I serve the fairy queen,
[p]To dew her orbs upon the green.
[p]The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
[p]In their gold coats spots you see;
[p]Those be rubies, fairy favours,
[p]In those freckles live their savours:
[p]I must go seek some dewdrops here
[p]And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
[p]Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
[p]Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
"
"The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
[p]Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
[p]For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
[p]Because that she as her attendant hath
[p]A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
[p]She never had so sweet a changeling;
[p]And jealous Oberon would have the child
[p]Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
[p]But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
[p]Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
[p]And now they never meet in grove or green,
[p]By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
[p]But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
[p]Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
"
"Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
[p]Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
[p]Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
[p]That frights the maidens of the villagery;
[p]Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
[p]And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
[p]And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
[p]Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
[p]Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
[p]You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
[p]Are not you he?
"
"Thou speak'st aright;
[p]I am that merry wanderer of the night.
[p]I jest to Oberon and make him smile
[p]When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
[p]Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
[p]And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
[p]In very likeness of a roasted crab,
[p]And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
[p]And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
[p]The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
[p]Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
[p]Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
[p]And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
[p]And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
[p]And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
[p]A merrier hour was never wasted there.
[p]But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.
"
"And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
"
"Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
"
"What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
[p]I have forsworn his bed and company.
"
"Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?
"
"Then I must be thy lady: but I know
[p]When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
[p]And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
[p]Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
[p]To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
[p]Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
[p]But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
[p]Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
[p]To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
[p]To give their bed joy and prosperity.
"
"How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
[p]Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
[p]Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
[p]Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
[p]From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
[p]And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
[p]With Ariadne and Antiopa?
"
"These are the forgeries of jealousy:
[p]And never, since the middle summer's spring,
[p]Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
[p]By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
[p]Or in the beached margent of the sea,
[p]To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
[p]But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
[p]Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
[p]As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
[p]Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
[p]Have every pelting river made so proud
[p]That they have overborne their continents:
[p]The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
[p]The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
[p]Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
[p]The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
[p]And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
[p]The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
[p]And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
[p]For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
[p]The human mortals want their winter here;
[p]No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
[p]Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
[p]Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
[p]That rheumatic diseases do abound:
[p]And thorough this distemperature we see
[p]The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
[p]Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
[p]And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
[p]An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
[p]Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
[p]The childing autumn, angry winter, change
[p]Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
[p]By their increase, now knows not which is which:
[p]And this same progeny of evils comes
[p]From our debate, from our dissension;
[p]We are their parents and original.
"
"Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
[p]Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
[p]I do but beg a little changeling boy,
[p]To be my henchman.
"
"Set your heart at rest:
[p]The fairy land buys not the child of me.
[p]His mother was a votaress of my order:
[p]And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
[p]Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
[p]And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
[p]Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
[p]When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
[p]And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
[p]Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
[p]Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
[p]Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
[p]To fetch me trifles, and return again,
[p]As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
[p]But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
[p]And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
[p]And for her sake I will not part with him.
"
"How long within this wood intend you stay?
"
"Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
[p]If you will patiently dance in our round
[p]And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
[p]If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
"
"Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
"
"Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
[p]We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
"
"Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
[p]Till I torment thee for this injury.
[p]My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
[p]Since once I sat upon a promontory,
[p]And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
[p]Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
[p]That the rude sea grew civil at her song
[p]And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
[p]To hear the sea-maid's music.
"
"I remember.
"
"That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
[p]Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
[p]Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
[p]At a fair vestal throned by the west,
[p]And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
[p]As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
[p]But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
[p]Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
[p]And the imperial votaress passed on,
[p]In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
[p]Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
[p]It fell upon a little western flower,
[p]Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
[p]And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
[p]Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
[p]The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
[p]Will make or man or woman madly dote
[p]Upon the next live creature that it sees.
[p]Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
[p]Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
"
"I'll put a girdle round about the earth
[p]In forty minutes.
"
"Having once this juice,
[p]I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
[p]And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
[p]The next thing then she waking looks upon,
[p]Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
[p]On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
[p]She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
[p]And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
[p]As I can take it with another herb,
[p]I'll make her render up her page to me.
[p]But who comes here? I am invisible;
[p]And I will overhear their conference.
"
"I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
[p]Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
[p]The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
[p]Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
[p]And here am I, and wode within this wood,
[p]Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
[p]Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
"
"You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
[p]But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
[p]Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
[p]And I shall have no power to follow you.
"
"Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
[p]Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
[p]Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?
"
"And even for that do I love you the more.
[p]I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
[p]The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
[p]Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
[p]Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
[p]Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
[p]What worser place can I beg in your love,--
[p]And yet a place of high respect with me,--
[p]Than to be used as you use your dog?
"
"Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
[p]For I am sick when I do look on thee.
"
"And I am sick when I look not on you.
"
"You do impeach your modesty too much,
[p]To leave the city and commit yourself
[p]Into the hands of one that loves you not;
[p]To trust the opportunity of night
[p]And the ill counsel of a desert place
[p]With the rich worth of your virginity.
"
"Your virtue is my privilege: for that
[p]It is not night when I do see your face,
[p]Therefore I think I am not in the night;
[p]Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
[p]For you in my respect are all the world:
[p]Then how can it be said I am alone,
[p]When all the world is here to look on me?
"
"I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
[p]And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
"
"The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
[p]Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
[p]Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
[p]The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
[p]Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
[p]When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
"
"I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
[p]Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
[p]But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
"
"Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
[p]You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
[p]Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
[p]We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
[p]We should be wood and were not made to woo.
[p][Exit DEMETRIUS]
[p]I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
[p]To die upon the hand I love so well.
"
"Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
[p]Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
[p][Re-enter PUCK]
[p]Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
"
"Ay, there it is.
"
"I pray thee, give it me.
[p]I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
[p]Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
[p]Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
[p]With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
[p]There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
[p]Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
[p]And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
[p]Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
[p]And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
[p]And make her full of hateful fantasies.
[p]Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
[p]A sweet Athenian lady is in love
[p]With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
[p]But do it when the next thing he espies
[p]May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
[p]By the Athenian garments he hath on.
[p]Effect it with some care, that he may prove
[p]More fond on her than she upon her love:
[p]And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
"
"Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.
"
"Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
[p]Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
[p]Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
[p]Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
[p]To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
[p]The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
[p]At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
[p]Then to your offices and let me rest.
[p][The Fairies sing]
[p]You spotted snakes with double tongue,
[p]Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
[p]Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
[p]Come not near our fairy queen.
[p]Philomel, with melody
[p]Sing in our sweet lullaby;
[p]Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
[p]Never harm,
[p]Nor spell nor charm,
[p]Come our lovely lady nigh;
[p]So, good night, with lullaby.
[p]Weaving spiders, come not here;
[p]Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
[p]Beetles black, approach not near;
[p]Worm nor snail, do no offence.
[p]Philomel, with melody, &c.
"
"Hence, away! now all is well:
[p]One aloof stand sentinel.
"
"What thou seest when thou dost wake,
[p]Do it for thy true-love take,
[p]Love and languish for his sake:
[p]Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
[p]Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
[p]In thy eye that shall appear
[p]When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
[p]Wake when some vile thing is near.
"
"Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
[p]And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
[p]We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
[p]And tarry for the comfort of the day.
"
"Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
[p]For I upon this bank will rest my head.
"
"One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
[p]One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
"
"Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
[p]Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
"
"O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
[p]Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
[p]I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
[p]So that but one heart we can make of it;
[p]Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
[p]So then two bosoms and a single troth.
[p]Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
[p]For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
"
"Lysander riddles very prettily:
[p]Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
[p]If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
[p]But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
[p]Lie further off; in human modesty,
[p]Such separation as may well be said
[p]Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
[p]So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
[p]Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
"
"Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
[p]And then end life when I end loyalty!
[p]Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!
"
"With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
"
"Through the forest have I gone.
[p]But Athenian found I none,
[p]On whose eyes I might approve
[p]This flower's force in stirring love.
[p]Night and silence.--Who is here?
[p]Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
[p]This is he, my master said,
[p]Despised the Athenian maid;
[p]And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
[p]On the dank and dirty ground.
[p]Pretty soul! she durst not lie
[p]Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
[p]Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
[p]All the power this charm doth owe.
[p]When thou wakest, let love forbid
[p]Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
[p]So awake when I am gone;
[p]For I must now to Oberon.
"
"Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
"
"I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
"
"O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.
"
"Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
"
"O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
[p]The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
[p]Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
[p]For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
[p]How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
[p]If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
[p]No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
[p]For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
[p]Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
[p]Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
[p]What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
[p]Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
[p]But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
[p]Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
[p]Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
"
"[Awaking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
[p]Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
[p]That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
[p]Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
[p]Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
"
"Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
[p]What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
[p]Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
"
"Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
[p]The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
[p]Not Hermia but Helena I love:
[p]Who will not change a raven for a dove?
[p]The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
[p]And reason says you are the worthier maid.
[p]Things growing are not ripe until their season
[p]So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
[p]And touching now the point of human skill,
[p]Reason becomes the marshal to my will
[p]And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
[p]Love's stories written in love's richest book.
"
"Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
[p]When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
[p]Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
[p]That I did never, no, nor never can,
[p]Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
[p]But you must flout my insufficiency?
[p]Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
[p]In such disdainful manner me to woo.
[p]But fare you well: perforce I must confess
[p]I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
[p]O, that a lady, of one man refused.
[p]Should of another therefore be abused!
"
"She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
[p]And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
[p]For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
[p]The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
[p]Or as tie heresies that men do leave
[p]Are hated most of those they did deceive,
[p]So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
[p]Of all be hated, but the most of me!
[p]And, all my powers, address your love and might
[p]To honour Helen and to be her knight!
"
"[Awaking] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
[p]To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
[p]Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
[p]Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
[p]Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
[p]And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
[p]Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
[p]What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
[p]Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
[p]Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
[p]No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
[p]Either death or you I'll find immediately.
"
"Are we all met?
"
"Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
[p]for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
[p]stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
[p]will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
"
"Peter Quince,--
"
"What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
"
"There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
[p]Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
[p]draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
[p]cannot abide. How answer you that?
"
"By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
"
"I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
"
"Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
[p]Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
[p]say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
[p]Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
[p]better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
[p]Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
[p]out of fear.
"
"Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
[p]written in eight and six.
"
"No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
"
"Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
"
"I fear it, I promise you.
"
"Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
[p]bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
[p]most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
[p]wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
[p]look to 't.
"
"Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
"
"Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
[p]be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
[p]must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
[p]defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
[p]You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
[p]entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
[p]for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
[p]were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
[p]man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
[p]his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
"
"Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
[p]that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
[p]you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
"
"Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
"
"A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
[p]out moonshine, find out moonshine.
"
"Yes, it doth shine that night.
"
"Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
[p]chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
[p]may shine in at the casement.
"
"Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
[p]and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
[p]present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
[p]another thing: we must have a wall in the great
[p]chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
[p]talk through the chink of a wall.
"
"You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
"
"Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
[p]have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
[p]about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
[p]fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
[p]and Thisby whisper.
"
"If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
[p]every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
[p]Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
[p]speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
[p]according to his cue.
"
"What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
[p]So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
[p]What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
[p]An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
"
"Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
"
"Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--
"
"Odours, odours.
"
"--odours savours sweet:
[p]So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
[p]But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
[p]And by and by I will to thee appear.
"
"A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
"
"Must I speak now?
"
"Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
[p]but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
"
"Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
[p]Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
[p]Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
[p]As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
[p]I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
"
"'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
[p]yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
[p]part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
[p]is past; it is, 'never tire.'
"
"O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
[p]never tire.
"
"If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
"
"O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,
[p]masters! fly, masters! Help!
"
"I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
[p]Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
[p]Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
[p]A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
[p]And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
[p]Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
"
"Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
[p]make me afeard.
"
"O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?
"
"What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
[p]you?
"
"Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art
[p]translated.
"
"I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
[p]to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
[p]from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
[p]and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
[p]I am not afraid.
[p][Sings]
[p]The ousel cock so black of hue,
[p]With orange-tawny bill,
[p]The throstle with his note so true,
[p]The wren with little quill,--
"
"[Awaking] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
"
"[Sings]
[p]The finch, the sparrow and the lark,
[p]The plain-song cuckoo gray,
[p]Whose note full many a man doth mark,
[p]And dares not answer nay;--
[p]for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish
[p]a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry
[p]'cuckoo' never so?
"
"I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
[p]Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
[p]So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
[p]And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
[p]On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
"
"Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
[p]for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
[p]love keep little company together now-a-days; the
[p]more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
[p]make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
"
"Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
"
"Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
[p]of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
"
"Out of this wood do not desire to go:
[p]Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
[p]I am a spirit of no common rate;
[p]The summer still doth tend upon my state;
[p]And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
[p]I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
[p]And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
[p]And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
[p]And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
[p]That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
[p]Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
"
"Ready.
"
"And I.
"
"And I.
"
"And I.
"
"Where shall we go?
"
"Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
[p]Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
[p]Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
[p]With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
[p]The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
[p]And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
[p]And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
[p]To have my love to bed and to arise;
[p]And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
[p]To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
[p]Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
"
"Hail, mortal!
"
"Hail!
"
"Hail!
"
"Hail!
"
"I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
[p]worship's name.
"
"Cobweb.
"
"I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
[p]Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
[p]you. Your name, honest gentleman?
"
"Peaseblossom.
"
"I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
[p]mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
[p]Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
[p]acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?
"
"Mustardseed.
"
"Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
[p]that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
[p]devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
[p]you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
[p]desire your more acquaintance, good Master
[p]Mustardseed.
"
"Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
[p]The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
[p]And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
[p]Lamenting some enforced chastity.
[p]Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
"
"I wonder if Titania be awaked;
[p]Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
[p]Which she must dote on in extremity.
[p][Enter PUCK]
[p]Here comes my messenger.
[p]How now, mad spirit!
[p]What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
"
"My mistress with a monster is in love.
[p]Near to her close and consecrated bower,
[p]While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
[p]A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
[p]That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
[p]Were met together to rehearse a play
[p]Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
[p]The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
[p]Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
[p]Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
[p]When I did him at this advantage take,
[p]An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
[p]Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
[p]And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
[p]As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
[p]Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
[p]Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
[p]Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
[p]So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
[p]And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
[p]He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
[p]Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
[p]thus strong,
[p]Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
[p]For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
[p]Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
[p]things catch.
[p]I led them on in this distracted fear,
[p]And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
[p]When in that moment, so it came to pass,
[p]Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
"
"This falls out better than I could devise.
[p]But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
[p]With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
"
"I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
[p]And the Athenian woman by his side:
[p]That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
"
"Stand close: this is the same Athenian.
"
"This is the woman, but not this the man.
"
"O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
[p]Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
"
"Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
[p]For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
[p]If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
[p]Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
[p]And kill me too.
[p]The sun was not so true unto the day
[p]As he to me: would he have stolen away
[p]From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
[p]This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
[p]May through the centre creep and so displease
[p]Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
[p]It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
[p]So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
"
"So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
[p]Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
[p]Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
[p]As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
"
"What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
[p]Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
"
"I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
"
"Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
[p]Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
[p]Henceforth be never number'd among men!
[p]O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
[p]Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
[p]And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
[p]Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
[p]An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
[p]Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
"
"You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
[p]I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
[p]Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
"
"I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
"
"An if I could, what should I get therefore?
"
"A privilege never to see me more.
[p]And from thy hated presence part I so:
[p]See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
"
"There is no following her in this fierce vein:
[p]Here therefore for a while I will remain.
[p]So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
[p]For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
[p]Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
[p]If for his tender here I make some stay.
"
"What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
[p]And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
[p]Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
[p]Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.
"
"Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
[p]A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
"
"About the wood go swifter than the wind,
[p]And Helena of Athens look thou find:
[p]All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
[p]With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
[p]By some illusion see thou bring her here:
[p]I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
"
"I go, I go; look how I go,
[p]Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
"
"Flower of this purple dye,
[p]Hit with Cupid's archery,
[p]Sink in apple of his eye.
[p]When his love he doth espy,
[p]Let her shine as gloriously
[p]As the Venus of the sky.
[p]When thou wakest, if she be by,
[p]Beg of her for remedy.
"
"Captain of our fairy band,
[p]Helena is here at hand;
[p]And the youth, mistook by me,
[p]Pleading for a lover's fee.
[p]Shall we their fond pageant see?
[p]Lord, what fools these mortals be!
"
"Stand aside: the noise they make
[p]Will cause Demetrius to awake.
"
"Then will two at once woo one;
[p]That must needs be sport alone;
[p]And those things do best please me
[p]That befal preposterously.
"
"Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
[p]Scorn and derision never come in tears:
[p]Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
[p]In their nativity all truth appears.
[p]How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
[p]Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
"
"You do advance your cunning more and more.
[p]When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
[p]These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
[p]Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
[p]Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
[p]Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.
"
"I had no judgment when to her I swore.
"
"Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
"
"Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
"
"[Awaking] O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
[p]To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
[p]Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
[p]Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
[p]That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
[p]Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
[p]When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
[p]This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
"
"O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
[p]To set against me for your merriment:
[p]If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
[p]You would not do me thus much injury.
[p]Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
[p]But you must join in souls to mock me too?
[p]If you were men, as men you are in show,
[p]You would not use a gentle lady so;
[p]To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
[p]When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
[p]You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
[p]And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
[p]A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
[p]To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
[p]With your derision! none of noble sort
[p]Would so offend a virgin, and extort
[p]A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
"
"You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
[p]For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
[p]And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
[p]In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
[p]And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
[p]Whom I do love and will do till my death.
"
"Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
"
"Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
[p]If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
[p]My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
[p]And now to Helen is it home return'd,
[p]There to remain.
"
"Helen, it is not so.
"
"Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
[p]Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
[p]Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
"
"Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
[p]The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
[p]Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
[p]It pays the hearing double recompense.
[p]Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
[p]Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
[p]But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
"
"Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?
"
"What love could press Lysander from my side?
"
"Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
[p]Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
[p]Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
[p]Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
[p]The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
"
"You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
"
"Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
[p]Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
[p]To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
[p]Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
[p]Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
[p]To bait me with this foul derision?
[p]Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
[p]The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
[p]When we have chid the hasty-footed time
[p]For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
[p]All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
[p]We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
[p]Have with our needles created both one flower,
[p]Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
[p]Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
[p]As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
[p]Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
[p]Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
[p]But yet an union in partition;
[p]Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
[p]So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
[p]Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
[p]Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
[p]And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
[p]To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
[p]It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
[p]Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
[p]Though I alone do feel the injury.
"
"I am amazed at your passionate words.
[p]I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
"
"Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
[p]To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
[p]And made your other love, Demetrius,
[p]Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
[p]To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
[p]Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
[p]To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
[p]Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
[p]And tender me, forsooth, affection,
[p]But by your setting on, by your consent?
[p]What thought I be not so in grace as you,
[p]So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
[p]But miserable most, to love unloved?
[p]This you should pity rather than despise.
"
"I understand not what you mean by this.
"
"Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
[p]Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
[p]Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
[p]This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
[p]If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
[p]You would not make me such an argument.
[p]But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
[p]Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
"
"Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
[p]My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!
"
"O excellent!
"
"Sweet, do not scorn her so.
"
"If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
"
"Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
[p]Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
[p]Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
[p]I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
[p]To prove him false that says I love thee not.
"
"I say I love thee more than he can do.
"
"If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
"
"Quick, come!
"
"Lysander, whereto tends all this?
"
"Away, you Ethiope!
"
"No, no; he'll
[p]Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
[p]But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!
"
"Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
[p]Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!
"
"Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
[p]Sweet love,--
"
"Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
[p]Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!
"
"Do you not jest?
"
"Yes, sooth; and so do you.
"
"Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
"
"I would I had your bond, for I perceive
[p]A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
"
"What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
[p]Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
"
"What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
[p]Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
[p]Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
[p]I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
[p]Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
[p]me:
[p]Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
[p]In earnest, shall I say?
"
"Ay, by my life;
[p]And never did desire to see thee more.
[p]Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
[p]Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
[p]That I do hate thee and love Helena.
"
"O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
[p]You thief of love! what, have you come by night
[p]And stolen my love's heart from him?
"
"Fine, i'faith!
[p]Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
[p]No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
[p]Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
[p]Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
"
"Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
[p]Now I perceive that she hath made compare
[p]Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
[p]And with her personage, her tall personage,
[p]Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
[p]And are you grown so high in his esteem;
[p]Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
[p]How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
[p]How low am I? I am not yet so low
[p]But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
"
"I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
[p]Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
[p]I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
[p]I am a right maid for my cowardice:
[p]Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
[p]Because she is something lower than myself,
[p]That I can match her.
"
"Lower! hark, again.
"
"Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
[p]I evermore did love you, Hermia,
[p]Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
[p]Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
[p]I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
[p]He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
[p]But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
[p]To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
[p]And now, so you will let me quiet go,
[p]To Athens will I bear my folly back
[p]And follow you no further: let me go:
[p]You see how simple and how fond I am.
"
"Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?
"
"A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
"
"What, with Lysander?
"
"With Demetrius.
"
"Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
"
"No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
"
"O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
[p]She was a vixen when she went to school;
[p]And though she be but little, she is fierce.
"
"'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
[p]Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
[p]Let me come to her.
"
"Get you gone, you dwarf;
[p]You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
[p]You bead, you acorn.
"
"You are too officious
[p]In her behalf that scorns your services.
[p]Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
[p]Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
[p]Never so little show of love to her,
[p]Thou shalt aby it.
"
"Now she holds me not;
[p]Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
[p]Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
"
"Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
"
"You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
[p]Nay, go not back.
"
"I will not trust you, I,
[p]Nor longer stay in your curst company.
[p]Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
[p]My legs are longer though, to run away.
"
"I am amazed, and know not what to say.
"
"This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
[p]Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.
"
"Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
[p]Did not you tell me I should know the man
[p]By the Athenian garment be had on?
[p]And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
[p]That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
[p]And so far am I glad it so did sort
[p]As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
"
"Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
[p]Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
[p]The starry welkin cover thou anon
[p]With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
[p]And lead these testy rivals so astray
[p]As one come not within another's way.
[p]Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
[p]Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
[p]And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
[p]And from each other look thou lead them thus,
[p]Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
[p]With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
[p]Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
[p]Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
[p]To take from thence all error with his might,
[p]And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
[p]When they next wake, all this derision
[p]Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
[p]And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
[p]With league whose date till death shall never end.
[p]Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
[p]I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
[p]And then I will her charmed eye release
[p]From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
"
"My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
[p]For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
[p]And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
[p]At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
[p]Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
[p]That in crossways and floods have burial,
[p]Already to their wormy beds are gone;
[p]For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
[p]They willfully themselves exile from light
[p]And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
"
"But we are spirits of another sort:
[p]I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
[p]And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
[p]Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
[p]Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
[p]Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
[p]But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
[p]We may effect this business yet ere day.
"
"Up and down, up and down,
[p]I will lead them up and down:
[p]I am fear'd in field and town:
[p]Goblin, lead them up and down.
[p]Here comes one.
"
"Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.
"
"Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?
"
"I will be with thee straight.
"
"Follow me, then,
[p]To plainer ground.
"
"Lysander! speak again:
[p]Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
[p]Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
"
"Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
[p]Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
[p]And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
[p]I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
[p]That draws a sword on thee.
"
"Yea, art thou there?
"
"Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.
"
"He goes before me and still dares me on:
[p]When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
[p]The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
[p]I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
[p]That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
[p]And here will rest me.
[p][Lies down]
[p]Come, thou gentle day!
[p]For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
[p]I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
"
"Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?
"
"Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
[p]Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
[p]And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
[p]Where art thou now?
"
"Come hither: I am here.
"
"Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
[p]If ever I thy face by daylight see:
[p]Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
[p]To measure out my length on this cold bed.
[p]By day's approach look to be visited.
"
"O weary night, O long and tedious night,
[p]Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,
[p]That I may back to Athens by daylight,
[p]From these that my poor company detest:
[p]And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
[p]Steal me awhile from mine own company.
"
"Yet but three? Come one more;
[p]Two of both kinds make up four.
[p]Here she comes, curst and sad:
[p]Cupid is a knavish lad,
[p]Thus to make poor females mad.
"
"Never so weary, never so in woe,
[p]Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
[p]I can no further crawl, no further go;
[p]My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
[p]Here will I rest me till the break of day.
[p]Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
"
"On the ground
[p]Sleep sound:
[p]I'll apply
[p]To your eye,
[p]Gentle lover, remedy.
[p][Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes]
[p]When thou wakest,
[p]Thou takest
[p]True delight
[p]In the sight
[p]Of thy former lady's eye:
[p]And the country proverb known,
[p]That every man should take his own,
[p]In your waking shall be shown:
[p]Jack shall have Jill;
[p]Nought shall go ill;
[p]The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.
"
"Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
[p]While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
[p]And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
[p]And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
"
"Where's Peaseblossom?
"
"Ready.
"
"Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?
"
"Ready.
"
"Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
[p]weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
[p]humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
[p]mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
[p]yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
[p]good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
[p]I would be loath to have you overflown with a
[p]honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?
"
"Ready.
"
"Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
[p]leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.
"
"What's your Will?
"
"Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
[p]to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
[p]methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
[p]am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
[p]I must scratch.
"
"What, wilt thou hear some music,
[p]my sweet love?
"
"I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
[p]the tongs and the bones.
"
"Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
"
"Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
[p]dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
[p]of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
"
"I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
[p]The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
"
"I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
[p]But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
[p]have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
"
"Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
[p]Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
[p][Exeunt fairies]
[p]So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
[p]Gently entwist; the female ivy so
[p]Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
[p]O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
"
"[Advancing] Welcome, good Robin.
[p]See'st thou this sweet sight?
[p]Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
[p]For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
[p]Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
[p]I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
[p]For she his hairy temples then had rounded
[p]With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
[p]And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
[p]Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
[p]Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
[p]Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
[p]When I had at my pleasure taunted her
[p]And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
[p]I then did ask of her her changeling child;
[p]Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
[p]To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
[p]And now I have the boy, I will undo
[p]This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
[p]And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
[p]From off the head of this Athenian swain;
[p]That, he awaking when the other do,
[p]May all to Athens back again repair
[p]And think no more of this night's accidents
[p]But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
[p]But first I will release the fairy queen.
[p]Be as thou wast wont to be;
[p]See as thou wast wont to see:
[p]Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
[p]Hath such force and blessed power.
[p]Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
"
"My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
[p]Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
"
"There lies your love.
"
"How came these things to pass?
[p]O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
"
"Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
[p]Titania, music call; and strike more dead
[p]Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
"
"Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
"
"Now, when thou wakest, with thine
[p]own fool's eyes peep.
"
"Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
[p]And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
[p]Now thou and I are new in amity,
[p]And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
[p]Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
[p]And bless it to all fair prosperity:
[p]There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
[p]Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
"
"Fairy king, attend, and mark:
[p]I do hear the morning lark.
"
"Then, my queen, in silence sad,
[p]Trip we after the night's shade:
[p]We the globe can compass soon,
[p]Swifter than the wandering moon.
"
"Come, my lord, and in our flight
[p]Tell me how it came this night
[p]That I sleeping here was found
[p]With these mortals on the ground.
"
"Go, one of you, find out the forester;
[p]For now our observation is perform'd;
[p]And since we have the vaward of the day,
[p]My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
[p]Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
[p]Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
[p][Exit an Attendant]
[p]We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
[p]And mark the musical confusion
[p]Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
"
"I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
[p]When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
[p]With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
[p]Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
[p]The skies, the fountains, every region near
[p]Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
[p]So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
"
"My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
[p]So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
[p]With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
[p]Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
[p]Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
[p]Each under each. A cry more tuneable
[p]Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
[p]In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
[p]Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?
"
"My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
[p]And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
[p]This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
[p]I wonder of their being here together.
"
"No doubt they rose up early to observe
[p]The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
[p]Came here in grace our solemnity.
[p]But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
[p]That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
"
"It is, my lord.
"
"Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
[p][Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS,]
[p]HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up]
[p]Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
[p]Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
"
"Pardon, my lord.
"
"I pray you all, stand up.
[p]I know you two are rival enemies:
[p]How comes this gentle concord in the world,
[p]That hatred is so far from jealousy,
[p]To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
"
"My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
[p]Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
[p]I cannot truly say how I came here;
[p]But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
[p]And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
[p]I came with Hermia hither: our intent
[p]Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
[p]Without the peril of the Athenian law.
"
"Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
[p]I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
[p]They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
[p]Thereby to have defeated you and me,
[p]You of your wife and me of my consent,
[p]Of my consent that she should be your wife.
"
"My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
[p]Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
[p]And I in fury hither follow'd them,
[p]Fair Helena in fancy following me.
[p]But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
[p]But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
[p]Melted as the snow, seems to me now
[p]As the remembrance of an idle gaud
[p]Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
[p]And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
[p]The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
[p]Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
[p]Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
[p]But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
[p]But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
[p]Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
[p]And will for evermore be true to it.
"
"Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
[p]Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
[p]Egeus, I will overbear your will;
[p]For in the temple by and by with us
[p]These couples shall eternally be knit:
[p]And, for the morning now is something worn,
[p]Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
[p]Away with us to Athens; three and three,
[p]We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
[p]Come, Hippolyta.
"
"These things seem small and undistinguishable,
"
"Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
[p]When every thing seems double.
"
"So methinks:
[p]And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
[p]Mine own, and not mine own.
"
"Are you sure
[p]That we are awake? It seems to me
[p]That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
[p]The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
"
"Yea; and my father.
"
"And Hippolyta.
"
"And he did bid us follow to the temple.
"
"Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
[p]And by the way let us recount our dreams.
"
"[Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will
[p]answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!
[p]Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
[p]the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen
[p]hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
[p]vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to
[p]say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go
[p]about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
[p]is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and
[p]methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if
[p]he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
[p]of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
[p]seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue
[p]to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
[p]was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
[p]this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,
[p]because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
[p]latter end of a play, before the duke:
[p]peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
[p]sing it at her death.
"
"Have you sent to Bottom's house? is he come home yet?
"
"He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
[p]transported.
"
"If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
[p]not forward, doth it?
"
"It is not possible: you have not a man in all
[p]Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
"
"No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
[p]man in Athens.
"
"Yea and the best person too; and he is a very
[p]paramour for a sweet voice.
"
"You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
[p]a thing of naught.
"
"Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and
[p]there is two or three lords and ladies more married:
[p]if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made
[p]men.
"
"O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
[p]day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
[p]sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
[p]sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;
[p]he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
[p]Pyramus, or nothing.
"
"Where are these lads? where are these hearts?
"
"Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
"
"Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
[p]what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
[p]will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.
"
"Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
"
"Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
[p]the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
[p]good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
[p]pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
[p]o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our
[p]play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
[p]clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
[p]pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
[p]lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
[p]nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
[p]do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
[p]comedy. No more words: away! go, away!
"
"'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
[p]lovers speak of.
"
"More strange than true: I never may believe
[p]These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
[p]Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
[p]Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
[p]More than cool reason ever comprehends.
[p]The lunatic, the lover and the poet
[p]Are of imagination all compact:
[p]One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
[p]That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
[p]Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
[p]The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
[p]Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
[p]And as imagination bodies forth
[p]The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
[p]Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
[p]A local habitation and a name.
[p]Such tricks hath strong imagination,
[p]That if it would but apprehend some joy,
[p]It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
[p]Or in the night, imagining some fear,
[p]How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
"
"But all the story of the night told over,
[p]And all their minds transfigured so together,
[p]More witnesseth than fancy's images
[p]And grows to something of great constancy;
[p]But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
"
"Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
[p][Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA]
[p]Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
[p]Accompany your hearts!
"
"More than to us
[p]Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
"
"Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
[p]To wear away this long age of three hours
[p]Between our after-supper and bed-time?
[p]Where is our usual manager of mirth?
[p]What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
[p]To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
[p]Call Philostrate.
"
"Here, mighty Theseus.
"
"Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
[p]What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
[p]The lazy time, if not with some delight?
"
"There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
[p]Make choice of which your highness will see first.
"
"[Reads] 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
[p]By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
[p]We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
[p]In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
[p][Reads]
[p]'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
[p]Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
[p]That is an old device; and it was play'd
[p]When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
[p][Reads]
[p]'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
[p]Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
[p]That is some satire, keen and critical,
[p]Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
[p][Reads]
[p]'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
[p]And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
[p]Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
[p]That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
[p]How shall we find the concord of this discord?
"
"A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
[p]Which is as brief as I have known a play;
[p]But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
[p]Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
[p]There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
[p]And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
[p]For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
[p]Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
[p]Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
[p]The passion of loud laughter never shed.
"
"What are they that do play it?
"
"Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
[p]Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
[p]And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
[p]With this same play, against your nuptial.
"
"And we will hear it.
"
"No, my noble lord;
[p]It is not for you: I have heard it over,
[p]And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
[p]Unless you can find sport in their intents,
[p]Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
[p]To do you service.
"
"I will hear that play;
[p]For never anything can be amiss,
[p]When simpleness and duty tender it.
[p]Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.
"
"I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
[p]And duty in his service perishing.
"
"Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
"
"He says they can do nothing in this kind.
"
"The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
[p]Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
[p]And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
[p]Takes it in might, not merit.
[p]Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
[p]To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
[p]Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
[p]Make periods in the midst of sentences,
[p]Throttle their practised accent in their fears
[p]And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
[p]Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
[p]Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
[p]And in the modesty of fearful duty
[p]I read as much as from the rattling tongue
[p]Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
[p]Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
[p]In least speak most, to my capacity.
"
"So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.
"
"Let him approach.
"
"If we offend, it is with our good will.
[p]That you should think, we come not to offend,
[p]But with good will. To show our simple skill,
[p]That is the true beginning of our end.
[p]Consider then we come but in despite.
[p]We do not come as minding to contest you,
[p]Our true intent is. All for your delight
[p]We are not here. That you should here repent you,
[p]The actors are at hand and by their show
[p]You shall know all that you are like to know.
"
"This fellow doth not stand upon points.
"
"He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
[p]not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
[p]enough to speak, but to speak true.
"
"Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
[p]on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.
"
"His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing
[p]impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
"
"Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
[p]But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
[p]This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
[p]This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
[p]This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
[p]Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
[p]And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
[p]To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
[p]This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
[p]Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
[p]By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
[p]To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
[p]This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
[p]The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
[p]Did scare away, or rather did affright;
[p]And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
[p]Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
[p]Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
[p]And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
[p]Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
[p]He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
[p]And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
[p]His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
[p]Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
[p]At large discourse, while here they do remain.
"
"I wonder if the lion be to speak.
"
"No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
"
"In this same interlude it doth befall
[p]That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
[p]And such a wall, as I would have you think,
[p]That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
[p]Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
[p]Did whisper often very secretly.
[p]This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
[p]That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
[p]And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
[p]Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
"
"Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
"
"It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
[p]discourse, my lord.
"
"Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!
"
"O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
[p]O night, which ever art when day is not!
[p]O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
[p]I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
[p]And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
[p]That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
[p]Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
[p]Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
[p][Wall holds up his fingers]
[p]Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
[p]But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
[p]O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
[p]Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
"
"The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
"
"No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
[p]is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
[p]spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
[p]fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
"
"[as Thisbe] O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
[p]For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
[p]My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
[p]Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
"
"I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
[p]To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!
"
"[as Thisbe] My love thou art, my love I think.
"
"Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
[p]And, like Limander, am I trusty still.
"
"[as Thisbe] And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
"
"Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
"
"[as Thisbe] As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
"
"O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
"
"[as Thisbe] I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
"
"Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
"
"[as Thisbe] 'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.
"
"[as Wall] Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
[p]And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
"
"Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
"
"No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
[p]without warning.
"
"This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
"
"The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
[p]are no worse, if imagination amend them.
"
"It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
"
"If we imagine no worse of them than they of
[p]themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
[p]come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
"
"[as Lion] You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
[p]The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
[p]May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
[p]When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
[p]Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
[p]A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
[p]For, if I should as lion come in strife
[p]Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
"
"A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
"
"The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
"
"This lion is a very fox for his valour.
"
"True; and a goose for his discretion.
"
"Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
[p]discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
"
"His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
[p]for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
[p]leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
"
"[as Moonshine] This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--
"
"He should have worn the horns on his head.
"
"He is no crescent, and his horns are
[p]invisible within the circumference.
"
"[as Moonshine] This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
[p]Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
"
"This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
[p]should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
[p]man i' the moon?
"
"He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
[p]see, it is already in snuff.
"
"I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
"
"It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
[p]he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
[p]reason, we must stay the time.
"
"Proceed, Moon.
"
"[as Moonshine] All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
[p]lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
[p]thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
"
"Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
[p]these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.
"
"[as Thisbe] This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
"
"[as Lion] [Roaring] Oh--
"
"Well roared, Lion.
"
"Well run, Thisbe.
"
"Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
[p]good grace.
"
"Well moused, Lion.
"
"And so the lion vanished.
"
"And then came Pyramus.
"
"Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
[p]I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
[p]For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
[p]I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
[p]But stay, O spite!
[p]But mark, poor knight,
[p]What dreadful dole is here!
[p]Eyes, do you see?
[p]How can it be?
[p]O dainty duck! O dear!
[p]Thy mantle good,
[p]What, stain'd with blood!
[p]Approach, ye Furies fell!
[p]O Fates, come, come,
[p]Cut thread and thrum;
[p]Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
"
"This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
[p]go near to make a man look sad.
"
"Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
"
"O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
[p]Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
[p]Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
[p]That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
[p]with cheer.
[p]Come, tears, confound;
[p]Out, sword, and wound
[p]The pap of Pyramus;
[p]Ay, that left pap,
[p]Where heart doth hop:
[p][Stabs himself]
[p]Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
[p]Now am I dead,
[p]Now am I fled;
[p]My soul is in the sky:
[p]Tongue, lose thy light;
[p]Moon take thy flight:
[p][Exit Moonshine]
[p]Now die, die, die, die, die.
"
"No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
"
"Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
"
"With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
[p]prove an ass.
"
"How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
[p]back and finds her lover?
"
"She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
[p]her passion ends the play.
"
"Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
[p]Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
"
"A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
[p]Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
[p]she for a woman, God bless us.
"
"She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
"
"And thus she means, videlicet:--
"
"[as Thisbe] Asleep, my love?
[p]What, dead, my dove?
[p]O Pyramus, arise!
[p]Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
[p]Dead, dead? A tomb
[p]Must cover thy sweet eyes.
[p]These My lips,
[p]This cherry nose,
[p]These yellow cowslip cheeks,
[p]Are gone, are gone:
[p]Lovers, make moan:
[p]His eyes were green as leeks.
[p]O Sisters Three,
[p]Come, come to me,
[p]With hands as pale as milk;
[p]Lay them in gore,
[p]Since you have shore
[p]With shears his thread of silk.
[p]Tongue, not a word:
[p]Come, trusty sword;
[p]Come, blade, my breast imbrue:
[p][Stabs herself]
[p]And, farewell, friends;
[p]Thus Thisby ends:
[p]Adieu, adieu, adieu.
"
"Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
"
"Ay, and Wall too.
"
"[Starting up] No assure you; the wall is down that
[p]parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
[p]epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
[p]of our company?
"
"No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
[p]excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
[p]dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
[p]that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
[p]in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
[p]tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
[p]discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
[p]epilogue alone.
[p][A dance]
[p]The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
[p]Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
[p]I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
[p]As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
[p]This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
[p]The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
[p]A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
[p]In nightly revels and new jollity.
"
"Now the hungry lion roars,
[p]And the wolf behowls the moon;
[p]Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
[p]All with weary task fordone.
[p]Now the wasted brands do glow,
[p]Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
[p]Puts the wretch that lies in woe
[p]In remembrance of a shroud.
[p]Now it is the time of night
[p]That the graves all gaping wide,
[p]Every one lets forth his sprite,
[p]In the church-way paths to glide:
[p]And we fairies, that do run
[p]By the triple Hecate's team,
[p]From the presence of the sun,
[p]Following darkness like a dream,
[p]Now are frolic: not a mouse
[p]Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
[p]I am sent with broom before,
[p]To sweep the dust behind the door.
"
"Through the house give gathering light,
[p]By the dead and drowsy fire:
[p]Every elf and fairy sprite
[p]Hop as light as bird from brier;
[p]And this ditty, after me,
[p]Sing, and dance it trippingly.
"
"First, rehearse your song by rote
[p]To each word a warbling note:
[p]Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
[p]Will we sing, and bless this place.
"
"Now, until the break of day,
[p]Through this house each fairy stray.
[p]To the best bride-bed will we,
[p]Which by us shall blessed be;
[p]And the issue there create
[p]Ever shall be fortunate.
[p]So shall all the couples three
[p]Ever true in loving be;
[p]And the blots of Nature's hand
[p]Shall not in their issue stand;
[p]Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
[p]Nor mark prodigious, such as are
[p]Despised in nativity,
[p]Shall upon their children be.
[p]With this field-dew consecrate,
[p]Every fairy take his gait;
[p]And each several chamber bless,
[p]Through this palace, with sweet peace;
[p]And the owner of it blest
[p]Ever shall in safety rest.
[p]Trip away; make no stay;
[p]Meet me all by break of day.
"
"If we shadows have offended,
[p]Think but this, and all is mended,
[p]That you have but slumber'd here
[p]While these visions did appear.
[p]And this weak and idle theme,
[p]No more yielding but a dream,
[p]Gentles, do not reprehend:
[p]if you pardon, we will mend:
[p]And, as I am an honest Puck,
[p]If we have unearned luck
[p]Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
[p]We will make amends ere long;
[p]Else the Puck a liar call;
[p]So, good night unto you all.
[p]Give me your hands, if we be friends,
[p]And Robin shall restore amends."
"I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
[p]comes this night to Messina.
"
"He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
[p]when I left him.
"
"How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
"
"But few of any sort, and none of name.
"
"A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
[p]home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
[p]bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
"
"Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
[p]Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
[p]promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
[p]the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
[p]bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
[p]tell you how.
"
"He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
[p]glad of it.
"
"I have already delivered him letters, and there
[p]appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
[p]not show itself modest enough without a badge of
[p]bitterness.
"
"Did he break out into tears?
"
"In great measure.
"
"A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
[p]truer than those that are so washed. How much
[p]better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
"
"I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
[p]wars or no?
"
"I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
[p]in the army of any sort.
"
"What is he that you ask for, niece?
"
"My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
"
"O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.
"
"He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
[p]Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
[p]the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
[p]him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
[p]killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
[p]he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
"
"Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
[p]but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
"
"He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
"
"You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
[p]he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
[p]excellent stomach.
"
"And a good soldier too, lady.
"
"And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
"
"A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
[p]honourable virtues.
"
"It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
[p]but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
"
"You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
[p]kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
[p]they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
[p]between them.
"
"Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
[p]conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
[p]now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
[p]he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
[p]bear it for a difference between himself and his
[p]horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
[p]to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
[p]companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
"
"Is't possible?
"
"Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
[p]the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
[p]next block.
"
"I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
"
"No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
[p]you, who is his companion? Is there no young
[p]squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
"
"He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
"
"O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
[p]is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
[p]runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
[p]he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
[p]thousand pound ere a' be cured.
"
"I will hold friends with you, lady.
"
"Do, good friend.
"
"You will never run mad, niece.
"
"No, not till a hot January.
"
"Don Pedro is approached.
"
"Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
[p]trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
[p]cost, and you encounter it.
"
"Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
[p]your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
[p]remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
[p]and happiness takes his leave.
"
"You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
[p]is your daughter.
"
"Her mother hath many times told me so.
"
"Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
"
"Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
"
"You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
[p]what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
[p]herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
[p]honourable father.
"
"If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
[p]have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
[p]like him as she is.
"
"I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
[p]Benedick: nobody marks you.
"
"What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
"
"Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
[p]such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
[p]Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
[p]in her presence.
"
"Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
[p]am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
[p]would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
[p]heart; for, truly, I love none.
"
"A dear happiness to women: they would else have
[p]been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
[p]and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
[p]had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
[p]swear he loves me.
"
"God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
[p]gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
[p]scratched face.
"
"Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
[p]a face as yours were.
"
"Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
"
"A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
"
"I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
[p]so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
[p]name; I have done.
"
"You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
"
"That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
[p]and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
[p]invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
[p]the least a month; and he heartily prays some
[p]occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
[p]hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
"
"If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
[p][To DON JOHN]
[p]Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
[p]the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
"
"I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
[p]you.
"
"Please it your grace lead on?
"
"Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
"
"Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
"
"I noted her not; but I looked on her.
"
"Is she not a modest young lady?
"
"Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
[p]my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
[p]after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
"
"No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
"
"Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
[p]praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
[p]for a great praise: only this commendation I can
[p]afford her, that were she other than she is, she
[p]were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
[p]do not like her.
"
"Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
[p]truly how thou likest her.
"
"Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
"
"Can the world buy such a jewel?
"
"Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
[p]with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
[p]to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
[p]rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
[p]you, to go in the song?
"
"In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
[p]looked on.
"
"I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
[p]matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
[p]possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
[p]as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
[p]hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
"
"I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
[p]contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
"
"Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
[p]one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
[p]Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
[p]Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
[p]into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
[p]Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
"
"What secret hath held you here, that you followed
[p]not to Leonato's?
"
"I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
"
"I charge thee on thy allegiance.
"
"You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
[p]man; I would have you think so; but, on my
[p]allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
[p]in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
[p]Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
[p]short daughter.
"
"If this were so, so were it uttered.
"
"Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
[p]'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
[p]so.'
"
"If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
[p]should be otherwise.
"
"Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
"
"You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
"
"By my troth, I speak my thought.
"
"And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
"
"And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
"
"That I love her, I feel.
"
"That she is worthy, I know.
"
"That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
[p]know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
[p]fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
"
"Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
[p]of beauty.
"
"And never could maintain his part but in the force
[p]of his will.
"
"That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
[p]brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
[p]thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
[p]forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
[p]all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
[p]them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
[p]right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
[p]I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
"
"I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
"
"With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
[p]not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
[p]with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
[p]out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
[p]up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
[p]blind Cupid.
"
"Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
[p]wilt prove a notable argument.
"
"If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
[p]at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
[p]the shoulder, and called Adam.
"
"Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
[p]doth bear the yoke.'
"
"The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
[p]Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
[p]them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
[p]and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
[p]good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
[p]'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
"
"If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
"
"Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
[p]Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
"
"I look for an earthquake too, then.
"
"Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
[p]meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
[p]Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
[p]not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
[p]great preparation.
"
"I have almost matter enough in me for such an
[p]embassage; and so I commit you--
"
"To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--
"
"The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.
"
"Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
[p]discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
[p]the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
[p]you flout old ends any further, examine your
[p]conscience: and so I leave you.
"
"My liege, your highness now may do me good.
"
"My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
[p]And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
[p]Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
"
"Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
"
"No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
[p]Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
"
"O, my lord,
[p]When you went onward on this ended action,
[p]I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
[p]That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
[p]Than to drive liking to the name of love:
[p]But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
[p]Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
[p]Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
[p]All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
[p]Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
"
"Thou wilt be like a lover presently
[p]And tire the hearer with a book of words.
[p]If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
[p]And I will break with her and with her father,
[p]And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
[p]That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
"
"How sweetly you do minister to love,
[p]That know love's grief by his complexion!
[p]But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
[p]I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
"
"What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
[p]The fairest grant is the necessity.
[p]Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
[p]And I will fit thee with the remedy.
[p]I know we shall have revelling to-night:
[p]I will assume thy part in some disguise
[p]And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
[p]And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
[p]And take her hearing prisoner with the force
[p]And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
[p]Then after to her father will I break;
[p]And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
[p]In practise let us put it presently.
"
"How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
[p]hath he provided this music?
"
"He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
[p]you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
"
"Are they good?
"
"As the event stamps them: but they have a good
[p]cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
[p]Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
[p]orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
[p]the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
[p]niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
[p]this night in a dance: and if he found her
[p]accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
[p]top and instantly break with you of it.
"
"Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
"
"A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
[p]question him yourself.
"
"No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
[p]itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
[p]that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
[p]if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
[p][Enter Attendants]
[p]Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
[p]mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
[p]skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
"
"What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out
[p]of measure sad?
"
"There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;
[p]therefore the sadness is without limit.
"
"You should hear reason.
"
"And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
"
"If not a present remedy, at least a patient
[p]sufferance.
"
"I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,
[p]born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
[p]medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
[p]what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
[p]at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
[p]for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
[p]tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and
[p]claw no man in his humour.
"
"Yea, but you must not make the full show of this
[p]till you may do it without controlment. You have of
[p]late stood out against your brother, and he hath
[p]ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is
[p]impossible you should take true root but by the
[p]fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
[p]that you frame the season for your own harvest.
"
"I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
[p]his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
[p]disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
[p]love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
[p]be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
[p]but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
[p]a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
[p]have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
[p]mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
[p]my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
[p]seek not to alter me.
"
"Can you make no use of your discontent?
"
"I make all use of it, for I use it only.
[p]Who comes here?
[p][Enter BORACHIO]
[p]What news, Borachio?
"
"I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
[p]brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
[p]can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
"
"Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
[p]What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
[p]unquietness?
"
"Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
"
"Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
"
"Even he.
"
"A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
[p]he?
"
"Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
"
"A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
"
"Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
[p]musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
[p]in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
[p]arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
[p]prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
[p]obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
"
"Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
[p]my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
[p]glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
[p]bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?
"
"To the death, my lord.
"
"Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
[p]greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
[p]my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?
"
"We'll wait upon your lordship.
"
"Was not Count John here at supper?
"
"I saw him not.
"
"How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
[p]him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
"
"He is of a very melancholy disposition.
"
"He were an excellent man that were made just in the
[p]midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
[p]like an image and says nothing, and the other too
[p]like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
"
"Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
[p]mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
[p]Benedick's face,--
"
"With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
[p]enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
[p]in the world, if a' could get her good-will.
"
"By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
[p]husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
"
"In faith, she's too curst.
"
"Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
[p]sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
[p]cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.
"
"So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
"
"Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
[p]blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
[p]evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
[p]beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
"
"You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
"
"What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
[p]and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
[p]beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
[p]beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
[p]a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
[p]man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
[p]sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
[p]apes into hell.
"
"Well, then, go you into hell?
"
"No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
[p]me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
[p]say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
[p]heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
[p]I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
[p]heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
[p]there live we as merry as the day is long.
"
"[To HERO] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
[p]by your father.
"
"Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
[p]and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
[p]that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
[p]make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
[p]me.'
"
"Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
"
"Not till God make men of some other metal than
[p]earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
[p]overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
[p]an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
[p]No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
[p]and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
"
"Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
[p]do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
"
"The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
[p]not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
[p]important, tell him there is measure in every thing
[p]and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
[p]wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
[p]a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
[p]and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
[p]fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
[p]measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
[p]repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
[p]cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
"
"Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
"
"I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
"
"The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.
[p][All put on their masks]
[p][Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR,]
[p]DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked]
"
"Lady, will you walk about with your friend?
"
"So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
[p]I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.
"
"With me in your company?
"
"I may say so, when I please.
"
"And when please you to say so?
"
"When I like your favour; for God defend the lute
[p]should be like the case!
"
"My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.
"
"Why, then, your visor should be thatched.
"
"Speak low, if you speak love.
"
"Well, I would you did like me.
"
"So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many
[p]ill-qualities.
"
"Which is one?
"
"I say my prayers aloud.
"
"I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.
"
"God match me with a good dancer!
"
"Amen.
"
"And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is
[p]done! Answer, clerk.
"
"No more words: the clerk is answered.
"
"I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.
"
"At a word, I am not.
"
"I know you by the waggling of your head.
"
"To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
"
"You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were
[p]the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you
[p]are he, you are he.
"
"At a word, I am not.
"
"Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your
[p]excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,
[p]mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an
[p]end.
"
"Will you not tell me who told you so?
"
"No, you shall pardon me.
"
"Nor will you not tell me who you are?
"
"Not now.
"
"That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
[p]out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
[p]Signior Benedick that said so.
"
"What's he?
"
"I am sure you know him well enough.
"
"Not I, believe me.
"
"Did he never make you laugh?
"
"I pray you, what is he?
"
"Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
[p]only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
[p]none but libertines delight in him; and the
[p]commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
[p]for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
[p]they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
[p]the fleet: I would he had boarded me.
"
"When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
"
"Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
[p]which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
[p]strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
[p]partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
[p]supper that night.
[p][Music]
[p]We must follow the leaders.
"
"In every good thing.
"
"Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at
[p]the next turning.
"
"Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
[p]withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
[p]The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.
"
"And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.
"
"Are not you Signior Benedick?
"
"You know me well; I am he.
"
"Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
[p]he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
[p]from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
[p]do the part of an honest man in it.
"
"How know you he loves her?
"
"I heard him swear his affection.
"
"So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.
"
"Come, let us to the banquet.
"
"Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
[p]But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
[p]'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
[p]Friendship is constant in all other things
[p]Save in the office and affairs of love:
[p]Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
[p]Let every eye negotiate for itself
[p]And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
[p]Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
[p]This is an accident of hourly proof,
[p]Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!
"
"Count Claudio?
"
"Yea, the same.
"
"Come, will you go with me?
"
"Whither?
"
"Even to the next willow, about your own business,
[p]county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
[p]about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
[p]your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
[p]it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.
"
"I wish him joy of her.
"
"Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
[p]sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
[p]have served you thus?
"
"I pray you, leave me.
"
"Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
[p]boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
"
"If it will not be, I'll leave you.
"
"Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
[p]But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
[p]know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
[p]under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
[p]am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
[p]is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
[p]that puts the world into her person and so gives me
[p]out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
"
"Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?
"
"Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
[p]I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
[p]warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
[p]that your grace had got the good will of this young
[p]lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
[p]either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
[p]to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
"
"To be whipped! What's his fault?
"
"The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
[p]overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
[p]companion, and he steals it.
"
"Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
[p]transgression is in the stealer.
"
"Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
[p]and the garland too; for the garland he might have
[p]worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
[p]you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.
"
"I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
[p]the owner.
"
"If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
[p]you say honestly.
"
"The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
[p]gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
[p]wronged by you.
"
"O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
[p]an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
[p]answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
[p]scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
[p]myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
[p]duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
[p]with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
[p]like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
[p]me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
[p]if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
[p]there were no living near her; she would infect to
[p]the north star. I would not marry her, though she
[p]were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
[p]he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
[p]turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
[p]the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
[p]her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
[p]some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
[p]she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
[p]sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
[p]would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
[p]and perturbation follows her.
"
"Look, here she comes.
"
"Will your grace command me any service to the
[p]world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
[p]to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
[p]I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
[p]furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
[p]Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
[p]Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
[p]rather than hold three words' conference with this
[p]harpy. You have no employment for me?
"
"None, but to desire your good company.
"
"O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
[p]endure my Lady Tongue.
"
"Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
[p]Signior Benedick.
"
"Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
[p]him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
[p]marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
[p]therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.
"
"You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
"
"So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
[p]should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
[p]Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
"
"Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?
"
"Not sad, my lord.
"
"How then? sick?
"
"Neither, my lord.
"
"The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
[p]well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
[p]something of that jealous complexion.
"
"I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
[p]though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
[p]false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
[p]fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
[p]and his good will obtained: name the day of
[p]marriage, and God give thee joy!
"
"Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
[p]fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
[p]grace say Amen to it.
"
"Speak, count, 'tis your cue.
"
"Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
[p]but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
[p]you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
[p]you and dote upon the exchange.
"
"Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
[p]with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.
"
"In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
"
"Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
[p]the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
[p]ear that he is in her heart.
"
"And so she doth, cousin.
"
"Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
[p]world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
[p]corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!
"
"Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
"
"I would rather have one of your father's getting.
[p]Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
[p]father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
"
"Will you have me, lady?
"
"No, my lord, unless I might have another for
[p]working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
[p]every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
[p]was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
"
"Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
[p]becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
[p]a merry hour.
"
"No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
[p]was a star danced, and under that was I born.
[p]Cousins, God give you joy!
"
"Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
"
"I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.
"
"By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
"
"There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
[p]lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
[p]not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
[p]she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
[p]herself with laughing.
"
"She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
"
"O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
"
"She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
"
"O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,
[p]they would talk themselves mad.
"
"County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
"
"To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
[p]have all his rites.
"
"Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
[p]seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
[p]things answer my mind.
"
"Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
[p]but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
[p]dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
[p]Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior
[p]Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
[p]affection the one with the other. I would fain have
[p]it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
[p]you three will but minister such assistance as I
[p]shall give you direction.
"
"My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten
[p]nights' watchings.
"
"And I, my lord.
"
"And you too, gentle Hero?
"
"I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my
[p]cousin to a good husband.
"
"And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
[p]I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
[p]strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
[p]will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
[p]shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
[p]two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
[p]despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
[p]shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
[p]Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be
[p]ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
[p]and I will tell you my drift.
"
"It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
[p]daughter of Leonato.
"
"Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
"
"Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
[p]medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
[p]and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
[p]evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
"
"Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
[p]dishonesty shall appear in me.
"
"Show me briefly how.
"
"I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
[p]I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
[p]gentlewoman to Hero.
"
"I remember.
"
"I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
[p]appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.
"
"What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
"
"The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
[p]the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
[p]he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
[p]Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
[p]up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
"
"What proof shall I make of that?
"
"Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,
[p]to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
[p]other issue?
"
"Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.
"
"Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
[p]the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
[p]that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
[p]prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
[p]honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
[p]reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
[p]semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
[p]thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
[p]offer them instances; which shall bear no less
[p]likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
[p]hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
[p]Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
[p]before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
[p]will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
[p]absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
[p]of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
[p]assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
"
"Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
[p]it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and
[p]thy fee is a thousand ducats.
"
"Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning
[p]shall not shame me.
"
"I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
"
"Boy!
"
"Signior?
"
"In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither
[p]to me in the orchard.
"
"I am here already, sir.
"
"I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.
[p][Exit Boy]
[p]I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
[p]another man is a fool when he dedicates his
[p]behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
[p]such shallow follies in others, become the argument
[p]of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
[p]is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
[p]with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
[p]rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
[p]when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
[p]good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
[p]carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
[p]speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
[p]and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
[p]words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
[p]strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
[p]these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
[p]be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
[p]I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
[p]of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
[p]is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
[p]well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
[p]graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
[p]my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
[p]or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
[p]fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not
[p]near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
[p]discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
[p]be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
[p]Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.
"
"Come, shall we hear this music?
"
"Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
[p]As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!
"
"See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
"
"O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
[p]We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.
"
"Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
"
"O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
[p]To slander music any more than once.
"
"It is the witness still of excellency
[p]To put a strange face on his own perfection.
[p]I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
"
"Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
[p]Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
[p]To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
[p]Yet will he swear he loves.
"
"Now, pray thee, come;
[p]Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
[p]Do it in notes.
"
"Note this before my notes;
[p]There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
"
"Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
[p]Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.
"
"Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
[p]not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
[p]of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
[p]all's done.
"
"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
[p]Men were deceivers ever,
[p]One foot in sea and one on shore,
[p]To one thing constant never:
[p]Then sigh not so, but let them go,
[p]And be you blithe and bonny,
[p]Converting all your sounds of woe
[p]Into Hey nonny, nonny.
[p]Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
[p]Of dumps so dull and heavy;
[p]The fraud of men was ever so,
[p]Since summer first was leafy:
[p]Then sigh not so, &c.
"
"By my troth, a good song.
"
"And an ill singer, my lord.
"
"Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.
"
"An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,
[p]they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad
[p]voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the
[p]night-raven, come what plague could have come after
[p]it.
"
"Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,
[p]get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we
[p]would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.
"
"The best I can, my lord.
"
"Do so: farewell.
[p][Exit BALTHASAR]
[p]Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of
[p]to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
[p]Signior Benedick?
"
"O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did
[p]never think that lady would have loved any man.
"
"No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she
[p]should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
[p]all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
"
"Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
"
"By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think
[p]of it but that she loves him with an enraged
[p]affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
"
"May be she doth but counterfeit.
"
"Faith, like enough.
"
"O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
[p]passion came so near the life of passion as she
[p]discovers it.
"
"Why, what effects of passion shows she?
"
"Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
"
"What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
[p]my daughter tell you how.
"
"She did, indeed.
"
"How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
[p]thought her spirit had been invincible against all
[p]assaults of affection.
"
"I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
[p]against Benedick.
"
"I should think this a gull, but that the
[p]white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
[p]sure, hide himself in such reverence.
"
"He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.
"
"Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
"
"No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.
"
"'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
[p]I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
[p]with scorn, write to him that I love him?'
"
"This says she now when she is beginning to write to
[p]him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
[p]there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
[p]sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
"
"Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
[p]pretty jest your daughter told us of.
"
"O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
[p]found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
"
"That.
"
"O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
[p]railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
[p]to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
[p]measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
[p]should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
[p]love him, I should.'
"
"Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
[p]beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
[p]sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'
"
"She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
[p]ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
[p]is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
[p]to herself: it is very true.
"
"It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
[p]other, if she will not discover it.
"
"To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
[p]torment the poor lady worse.
"
"An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
[p]excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
[p]she is virtuous.
"
"And she is exceeding wise.
"
"In every thing but in loving Benedick.
"
"O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
[p]a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
[p]the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
[p]cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
"
"I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
[p]have daffed all other respects and made her half
[p]myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
[p]what a' will say.
"
"Were it good, think you?
"
"Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
[p]will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
[p]she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
[p]her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
[p]accustomed crossness.
"
"She doth well: if she should make tender of her
[p]love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
[p]man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
"
"He is a very proper man.
"
"He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
"
"Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.
"
"He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
"
"And I take him to be valiant.
"
"As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
[p]quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
[p]avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
[p]them with a most Christian-like fear.
"
"If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:
[p]if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
[p]quarrel with fear and trembling.
"
"And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
[p]howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
[p]he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
[p]we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?
"
"Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
[p]good counsel.
"
"Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
"
"Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
[p]let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
[p]could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
[p]how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
"
"My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.
"
"If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
[p]trust my expectation.
"
"Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
[p]must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
[p]sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
[p]another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
[p]scene that I would see, which will be merely a
[p]dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
"
"[Coming forward] This can be no trick: the
[p]conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
[p]this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
[p]seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
[p]why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
[p]they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
[p]the love come from her; they say too that she will
[p]rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
[p]never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
[p]are they that hear their detractions and can put
[p]them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
[p]truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
[p]so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
[p]me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
[p]no great argument of her folly, for I will be
[p]horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
[p]odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
[p]because I have railed so long against marriage: but
[p]doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
[p]in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
[p]Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
[p]the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
[p]No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
[p]die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
[p]were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
[p]she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
[p]her.
"
"Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
"
"Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
"
"I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
[p]pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
[p]not have come.
"
"You take pleasure then in the message?
"
"Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
[p]point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
[p]signior: fare you well.
"
"Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
[p]to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
[p]no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
[p]to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
[p]that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
[p]not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
[p]love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.
"
"Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;
[p]There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
[p]Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
[p]Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
[p]Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
[p]Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
[p]And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
[p]Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
[p]Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,
[p]Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
[p]Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
[p]To listen our purpose. This is thy office;
[p]Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
"
"I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
"
"Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
[p]As we do trace this alley up and down,
[p]Our talk must only be of Benedick.
[p]When I do name him, let it be thy part
[p]To praise him more than ever man did merit:
[p]My talk to thee must be how Benedick
[p]Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
[p]Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
[p]That only wounds by hearsay.
[p][Enter BEATRICE, behind]
[p]Now begin;
[p]For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
[p]Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
"
"The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
[p]Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
[p]And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
[p]So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
[p]Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
[p]Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
"
"Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
[p]Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
[p][Approaching the bower]
[p]No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
[p]I know her spirits are as coy and wild
[p]As haggerds of the rock.
"
"But are you sure
[p]That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
"
"So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
"
"And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
"
"They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
[p]But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
[p]To wish him wrestle with affection,
[p]And never to let Beatrice know of it.
"
"Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
[p]Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
[p]As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
"
"O god of love! I know he doth deserve
[p]As much as may be yielded to a man:
[p]But Nature never framed a woman's heart
[p]Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
[p]Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
[p]Misprising what they look on, and her wit
[p]Values itself so highly that to her
[p]All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
[p]Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
[p]She is so self-endeared.
"
"Sure, I think so;
[p]And therefore certainly it were not good
[p]She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
"
"Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
[p]How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
[p]But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
[p]She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
[p]If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
[p]Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
[p]If low, an agate very vilely cut;
[p]If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
[p]If silent, why, a block moved with none.
[p]So turns she every man the wrong side out
[p]And never gives to truth and virtue that
[p]Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
"
"Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
"
"No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
[p]As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
[p]But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
[p]She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
[p]Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
[p]Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
[p]Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
[p]It were a better death than die with mocks,
[p]Which is as bad as die with tickling.
"
"Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
"
"No; rather I will go to Benedick
[p]And counsel him to fight against his passion.
[p]And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
[p]To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
[p]How much an ill word may empoison liking.
"
"O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
[p]She cannot be so much without true judgment--
[p]Having so swift and excellent a wit
[p]As she is prized to have--as to refuse
[p]So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
"
"He is the only man of Italy.
[p]Always excepted my dear Claudio.
"
"I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
[p]Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
[p]For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
[p]Goes foremost in report through Italy.
"
"Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
"
"His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
[p]When are you married, madam?
"
"Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
[p]I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
[p]Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.
"
"She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.
"
"If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
[p]Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
"
"[Coming forward]
[p]What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
[p]Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
[p]Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
[p]No glory lives behind the back of such.
[p]And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
[p]Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
[p]If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
[p]To bind our loves up in a holy band;
[p]For others say thou dost deserve, and I
[p]Believe it better than reportingly.
"
"I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and
[p]then go I toward Arragon.
"
"I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll
[p]vouchsafe me.
"
"Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
[p]of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
[p]and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
[p]with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
[p]of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
[p]mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
[p]bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
[p]him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
[p]tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
[p]tongue speaks.
"
"Gallants, I am not as I have been.
"
"So say I. methinks you are sadder.
"
"I hope he be in love.
"
"Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
[p]him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
[p]he wants money.
"
"I have the toothache.
"
"Draw it.
"
"Hang it!
"
"You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
"
"What! sigh for the toothache?
"
"Where is but a humour or a worm.
"
"Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
[p]it.
"
"Yet say I, he is in love.
"
"There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
[p]a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
[p]a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
[p]shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
[p]the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
[p]the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
[p]to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
[p]fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
"
"If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
[p]believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
[p]mornings; what should that bode?
"
"Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
"
"No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
[p]and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
[p]stuffed tennis-balls.
"
"Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
"
"Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
[p]out by that?
"
"That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
"
"The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
"
"And when was he wont to wash his face?
"
"Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
[p]what they say of him.
"
"Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
[p]a lute-string and now governed by stops.
"
"Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
[p]conclude he is in love.
"
"Nay, but I know who loves him.
"
"That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
"
"Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
[p]all, dies for him.
"
"She shall be buried with her face upwards.
"
"Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
[p]signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
[p]or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
[p]hobby-horses must not hear.
"
"For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.
"
"'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
[p]played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two
[p]bears will not bite one another when they meet.
"
"My lord and brother, God save you!
"
"Good den, brother.
"
"If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
"
"In private?
"
"If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for
[p]what I would speak of concerns him.
"
"What's the matter?
"
"[To CLAUDIO] Means your lordship to be married
[p]to-morrow?
"
"You know he does.
"
"I know not that, when he knows what I know.
"
"If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
"
"You may think I love you not: let that appear
[p]hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
[p]manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
[p]well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
[p]your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
[p]labour ill bestowed.
"
"Why, what's the matter?
"
"I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
[p]shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,
[p]the lady is disloyal.
"
"Who, Hero?
"
"Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:
"
"Disloyal?
"
"The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
[p]could say she were worse: think you of a worse
[p]title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
[p]further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
[p]see her chamber-window entered, even the night
[p]before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
[p]to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
[p]to change your mind.
"
"May this be so?
"
"I will not think it.
"
"If you dare not trust that you see, confess not
[p]that you know: if you will follow me, I will show
[p]you enough; and when you have seen more and heard
[p]more, proceed accordingly.
"
"If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
[p]her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
[p]wed, there will I shame her.
"
"And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join
[p]with thee to disgrace her.
"
"I will disparage her no farther till you are my
[p]witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and
[p]let the issue show itself.
"
"O day untowardly turned!
"
"O mischief strangely thwarting!
"
"O plague right well prevented! so will you say when
[p]you have seen the sequel.
"
"Are you good men and true?
"
"Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer
[p]salvation, body and soul.
"
"Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
[p]they should have any allegiance in them, being
[p]chosen for the prince's watch.
"
"Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
"
"First, who think you the most desertless man to be
[p]constable?
"
"Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can
[p]write and read.
"
"Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
[p]you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
[p]the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.
"
"Both which, master constable,--
"
"You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
[p]for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
[p]no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
[p]let that appear when there is no need of such
[p]vanity. You are thought here to be the most
[p]senseless and fit man for the constable of the
[p]watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
[p]charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
[p]to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
"
"How if a' will not stand?
"
"Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
[p]presently call the rest of the watch together and
[p]thank God you are rid of a knave.
"
"If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
[p]of the prince's subjects.
"
"True, and they are to meddle with none but the
[p]prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
[p]the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
[p]talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
"
"We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
[p]belongs to a watch.
"
"Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
[p]watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
[p]offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
[p]stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
[p]ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
"
"How if they will not?
"
"Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
[p]they make you not then the better answer, you may
[p]say they are not the men you took them for.
"
"Well, sir.
"
"If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
[p]of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
[p]kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
[p]why the more is for your honesty.
"
"If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
[p]hands on him?
"
"Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
[p]that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
[p]way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
[p]show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
"
"You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
"
"Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
[p]a man who hath any honesty in him.
"
"If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
[p]to the nurse and bid her still it.
"
"How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
"
"Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
[p]her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
[p]lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.
"
"'Tis very true.
"
"This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
[p]to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
[p]prince in the night, you may stay him.
"
"Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.
"
"Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
[p]the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
[p]the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
[p]to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
[p]man against his will.
"
"By'r lady, I think it be so.
"
"Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
[p]any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
[p]fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
[p]Come, neighbour.
"
"Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
[p]upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.
"
"One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
[p]about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being
[p]there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
[p]Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.
"
"What Conrade!
"
"[Aside] Peace! stir not.
"
"Conrade, I say!
"
"Here, man; I am at thy elbow.
"
"Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a
[p]scab follow.
"
"I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward
[p]with thy tale.
"
"Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
[p]it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,
[p]utter all to thee.
"
"[Aside] Some treason, masters: yet stand close.
"
"Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
"
"Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
"
"Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
[p]villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
[p]have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
[p]price they will.
"
"I wonder at it.
"
"That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
[p]the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
[p]nothing to a man.
"
"Yes, it is apparel.
"
"I mean, the fashion.
"
"Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
"
"Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
[p]seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
[p]is?
"
"[Aside] I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile
[p]thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a
[p]gentleman: I remember his name.
"
"Didst thou not hear somebody?
"
"No; 'twas the vane on the house.
"
"Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
[p]fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
[p]bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
[p]sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
[p]in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
[p]priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
[p]shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
[p]where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
"
"All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
[p]out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
[p]thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
[p]shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
"
"Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
[p]wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
[p]name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
[p]chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
[p]night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
[p]tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
[p]planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
[p]John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
"
"And thought they Margaret was Hero?
"
"Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the
[p]devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
[p]by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
[p]the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
[p]by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
[p]Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
[p]he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
[p]at the temple, and there, before the whole
[p]congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
[p]and send her home again without a husband.
"
"We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!
"
"Call up the right master constable. We have here
[p]recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
[p]ever was known in the commonwealth.
"
"And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'
[p]wears a lock.
"
"Masters, masters,--
"
"You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.
"
"Masters,--
"
"Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.
"
"We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken
[p]up of these men's bills.
"
"A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.
"
"Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire
[p]her to rise.
"
"I will, lady.
"
"And bid her come hither.
"
"Well.
"
"Troth, I think your other rabato were better.
"
"No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.
"
"By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your
[p]cousin will say so.
"
"My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear
[p]none but this.
"
"I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair
[p]were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare
[p]fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's
[p]gown that they praise so.
"
"O, that exceeds, they say.
"
"By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of
[p]yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with
[p]silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,
[p]and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:
[p]but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent
[p]fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.
"
"God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is
[p]exceeding heavy.
"
"'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
"
"Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?
"
"Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not
[p]marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord
[p]honourable without marriage? I think you would have
[p]me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad
[p]thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend
[p]nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a
[p]husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband
[p]and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not
[p]heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.
"
"Good morrow, coz.
"
"Good morrow, sweet Hero.
"
"Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?
"
"I am out of all other tune, methinks.
"
"Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a
[p]burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.
"
"Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
[p]husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall
[p]lack no barns.
"
"O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.
"
"'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were
[p]ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!
"
"For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
"
"For the letter that begins them all, H.
"
"Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more
[p]sailing by the star.
"
"What means the fool, trow?
"
"Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!
"
"These gloves the count sent me; they are an
[p]excellent perfume.
"
"I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.
"
"A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.
"
"O, God help me! God help me! how long have you
[p]professed apprehension?
"
"Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?
"
"It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your
[p]cap. By my troth, I am sick.
"
"Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,
[p]and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.
"
"There thou prickest her with a thistle.
"
"Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
[p]this Benedictus.
"
"Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I
[p]meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
[p]that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am
[p]not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
[p]not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
[p]if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
[p]are in love or that you will be in love or that you
[p]can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
[p]now is he become a man: he swore he would never
[p]marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
[p]his meat without grudging: and how you may be
[p]converted I know not, but methinks you look with
[p]your eyes as other women do.
"
"What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
"
"Not a false gallop.
"
"Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior
[p]Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the
[p]town, are come to fetch you to church.
"
"Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.
"
"What would you with me, honest neighbour?
"
"Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you
[p]that decerns you nearly.
"
"Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.
"
"Marry, this it is, sir.
"
"Yes, in truth it is, sir.
"
"What is it, my good friends?
"
"Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the
[p]matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so
[p]blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,
[p]in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
"
"Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living
[p]that is an old man and no honester than I.
"
"Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
"
"Neighbours, you are tedious.
"
"It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the
[p]poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,
[p]if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in
[p]my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
"
"All thy tediousness on me, ah?
"
"Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for
[p]I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any
[p]man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I
[p]am glad to hear it.
"
"And so am I.
"
"I would fain know what you have to say.
"
"Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your
[p]worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant
[p]knaves as any in Messina.
"
"A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they
[p]say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help
[p]us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,
[p]neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men
[p]ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
[p]soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever
[p]broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men
[p]are not alike; alas, good neighbour!
"
"Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.
"
"Gifts that God gives.
"
"I must leave you.
"
"One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
[p]comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would
[p]have them this morning examined before your worship.
"
"Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I
[p]am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.
"
"It shall be suffigance.
"
"Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.
"
"My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to
[p]her husband.
"
"I'll wait upon them: I am ready.
"
"Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;
[p]bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we
[p]are now to examination these men.
"
"And we must do it wisely.
"
"We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's
[p]that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only
[p]get the learned writer to set down our
[p]excommunication and meet me at the gaol.
"
"Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain
[p]form of marriage, and you shall recount their
[p]particular duties afterwards.
"
"You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.
"
"No.
"
"To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.
"
"Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.
"
"I do.
"
"If either of you know any inward impediment why you
[p]should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
[p]to utter it.
"
"Know you any, Hero?
"
"None, my lord.
"
"Know you any, count?
"
"I dare make his answer, none.
"
"O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
[p]do, not knowing what they do!
"
"How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
[p]laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
"
"Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
[p]Will you with free and unconstrained soul
[p]Give me this maid, your daughter?
"
"As freely, son, as God did give her me.
"
"And what have I to give you back, whose worth
[p]May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
"
"Nothing, unless you render her again.
"
"Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
[p]There, Leonato, take her back again:
[p]Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
[p]She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
[p]Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
[p]O, what authority and show of truth
[p]Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
[p]Comes not that blood as modest evidence
[p]To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
[p]All you that see her, that she were a maid,
[p]By these exterior shows? But she is none:
[p]She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
[p]Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
"
"What do you mean, my lord?
"
"Not to be married,
[p]Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
"
"Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
[p]Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
[p]And made defeat of her virginity,--
"
"I know what you would say: if I have known her,
[p]You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
[p]And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
[p]No, Leonato,
[p]I never tempted her with word too large;
[p]But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
[p]Bashful sincerity and comely love.
"
"And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
"
"Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
[p]You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
[p]As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
[p]But you are more intemperate in your blood
[p]Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
[p]That rage in savage sensuality.
"
"Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
"
"Sweet prince, why speak not you?
"
"What should I speak?
[p]I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
[p]To link my dear friend to a common stale.
"
"Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
"
"Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
"
"This looks not like a nuptial.
"
"True! O God!
"
"Leonato, stand I here?
[p]Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
[p]Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?
"
"All this is so: but what of this, my lord?
"
"Let me but move one question to your daughter;
[p]And, by that fatherly and kindly power
[p]That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
"
"I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
"
"O, God defend me! how am I beset!
[p]What kind of catechising call you this?
"
"To make you answer truly to your name.
"
"Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
[p]With any just reproach?
"
"Marry, that can Hero;
[p]Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
[p]What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
[p]Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
[p]Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
"
"I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.
"
"Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
[p]I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
[p]Myself, my brother and this grieved count
[p]Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
[p]Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
[p]Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
[p]Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
[p]A thousand times in secret.
"
"Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
[p]Not to be spoke of;
[p]There is not chastity enough in language
[p]Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
[p]I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
"
"O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
[p]If half thy outward graces had been placed
[p]About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
[p]But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
[p]Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
[p]For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
[p]And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
[p]To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
[p]And never shall it more be gracious.
"
"Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
"
"Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?
"
"Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,
[p]Smother her spirits up.
"
"How doth the lady?
"
"Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
[p]Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!
"
"O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
[p]Death is the fairest cover for her shame
[p]That may be wish'd for.
"
"How now, cousin Hero!
"
"Have comfort, lady.
"
"Dost thou look up?
"
"Yea, wherefore should she not?
"
"Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
[p]Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
[p]The story that is printed in her blood?
[p]Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
[p]For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
[p]Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
[p]Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
[p]Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
[p]Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
[p]O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
[p]Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
[p]Why had I not with charitable hand
[p]Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
[p]Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
[p]I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
[p]This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
[p]But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
[p]And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
[p]That I myself was to myself not mine,
[p]Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
[p]Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
[p]Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
[p]And salt too little which may season give
[p]To her foul-tainted flesh!
"
"Sir, sir, be patient.
[p]For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
[p]I know not what to say.
"
"O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
"
"Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
"
"No, truly not; although, until last night,
[p]I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
"
"Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
[p]Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
[p]Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
[p]Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
[p]Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
"
"Hear me a little; for I have only been
[p]Silent so long and given way unto
[p]This course of fortune [--]
[p]By noting of the lady I have mark'd
[p]A thousand blushing apparitions
[p]To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
[p]In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
[p]And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
[p]To burn the errors that these princes hold
[p]Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
[p]Trust not my reading nor my observations,
[p]Which with experimental seal doth warrant
[p]The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
[p]My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
[p]If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
[p]Under some biting error.
"
"Friar, it cannot be.
[p]Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
[p]Is that she will not add to her damnation
[p]A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
[p]Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
[p]That which appears in proper nakedness?
"
"Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
"
"They know that do accuse me; I know none:
[p]If I know more of any man alive
[p]Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
[p]Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
[p]Prove you that any man with me conversed
[p]At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
[p]Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
[p]Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
"
"There is some strange misprision in the princes.
"
"Two of them have the very bent of honour;
[p]And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
[p]The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
[p]Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.
"
"I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
[p]These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
[p]The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
[p]Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
[p]Nor age so eat up my invention,
[p]Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
[p]Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
[p]But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
[p]Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
[p]Ability in means and choice of friends,
[p]To quit me of them throughly.
"
"Pause awhile,
[p]And let my counsel sway you in this case.
[p]Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
[p]Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
[p]And publish it that she is dead indeed;
[p]Maintain a mourning ostentation
[p]And on your family's old monument
[p]Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
[p]That appertain unto a burial.
"
"What shall become of this? what will this do?
"
"Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
[p]Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
[p]But not for that dream I on this strange course,
[p]But on this travail look for greater birth.
[p]She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
[p]Upon the instant that she was accused,
[p]Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
[p]Of every hearer: for it so falls out
[p]That what we have we prize not to the worth
[p]Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
[p]Why, then we rack the value, then we find
[p]The virtue that possession would not show us
[p]Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
[p]When he shall hear she died upon his words,
[p]The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
[p]Into his study of imagination,
[p]And every lovely organ of her life
[p]Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
[p]More moving-delicate and full of life,
[p]Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
[p]Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
[p]If ever love had interest in his liver,
[p]And wish he had not so accused her,
[p]No, though he thought his accusation true.
[p]Let this be so, and doubt not but success
[p]Will fashion the event in better shape
[p]Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
[p]But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
[p]The supposition of the lady's death
[p]Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
[p]And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
[p]As best befits her wounded reputation,
[p]In some reclusive and religious life,
[p]Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.
"
"Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
[p]And though you know my inwardness and love
[p]Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
[p]Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
[p]As secretly and justly as your soul
[p]Should with your body.
"
"Being that I flow in grief,
[p]The smallest twine may lead me.
"
"'Tis well consented: presently away;
[p]For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
[p]Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
[p]Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.
"
"Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
"
"Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
"
"I will not desire that.
"
"You have no reason; I do it freely.
"
"Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
"
"Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
"
"Is there any way to show such friendship?
"
"A very even way, but no such friend.
"
"May a man do it?
"
"It is a man's office, but not yours.
"
"I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
[p]not that strange?
"
"As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
[p]possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
[p]you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
[p]confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.
"
"By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
"
"Do not swear, and eat it.
"
"I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
[p]him eat it that says I love not you.
"
"Will you not eat your word?
"
"With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
[p]I love thee.
"
"Why, then, God forgive me!
"
"What offence, sweet Beatrice?
"
"You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
[p]protest I loved you.
"
"And do it with all thy heart.
"
"I love you with so much of my heart that none is
[p]left to protest.
"
"Come, bid me do any thing for thee.
"
"Kill Claudio.
"
"Ha! not for the wide world.
"
"You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
"
"Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
"
"I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
[p]you: nay, I pray you, let me go.
"
"Beatrice,--
"
"In faith, I will go.
"
"We'll be friends first.
"
"You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
"
"Is Claudio thine enemy?
"
"Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
[p]hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
[p]that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
[p]come to take hands; and then, with public
[p]accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
[p]--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
[p]in the market-place.
"
"Hear me, Beatrice,--
"
"Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!
"
"Nay, but, Beatrice,--
"
"Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
"
"Beat--
"
"Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
[p]a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
[p]surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
[p]had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
[p]manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
[p]compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
[p]trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
[p]that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
[p]man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
"
"Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
"
"Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
"
"Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
"
"Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
"
"Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will
[p]kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
[p]Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
[p]hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
[p]cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.
"
"Is our whole dissembly appeared?
"
"O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.
"
"Which be the malefactors?
"
"Marry, that am I and my partner.
"
"Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.
"
"But which are the offenders that are to be
[p]examined? let them come before master constable.
"
"Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
[p]name, friend?
"
"Borachio.
"
"Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
"
"I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
"
"Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
[p]you serve God?
"
"[with Borachio] Yea, sir, we hope.
"
"Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
[p]write God first; for God defend but God should go
[p]before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
[p]that you are little better than false knaves; and it
[p]will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
[p]you for yourselves?
"
"Marry, sir, we say we are none.
"
"A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
[p]will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
[p]word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
[p]you are false knaves.
"
"Sir, I say to you we are none.
"
"Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
[p]tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?
"
"Master constable, you go not the way to examine:
[p]you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
"
"Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
[p]come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
[p]name, accuse these men.
"
"This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's
[p]brother, was a villain.
"
"Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
[p]perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.
"
"Master constable,--
"
"Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
[p]I promise thee.
"
"What heard you him say else?
"
"Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of
[p]Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
"
"Flat burglary as ever was committed.
"
"Yea, by mass, that it is.
"
"What else, fellow?
"
"And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to
[p]disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.
"
"O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
[p]redemption for this.
"
"What else?
"
"This is all.
"
"And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
[p]Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;
[p]Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
[p]refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
[p]Master constable, let these men be bound, and
[p]brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show
[p]him their examination.
"
"Come, let them be opinioned.
"
"Let them be in the hands--
"
"Off, coxcomb!
"
"God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write
[p]down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
[p]Thou naughty varlet!
"
"Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.
"
"Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
[p]suspect my years? O that he were here to write me
[p]down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an
[p]ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not
[p]that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
[p]piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
[p]I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
[p]and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
[p]more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
[p]Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a
[p]rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
[p]had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
[p]thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
[p]I had been writ down an ass!
"
"If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:
[p]And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
[p]Against yourself.
"
"I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
[p]Which falls into mine ears as profitless
[p]As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
[p]Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
[p]But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
[p]Bring me a father that so loved his child,
[p]Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
[p]And bid him speak of patience;
[p]Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
[p]And let it answer every strain for strain,
[p]As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
[p]In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
[p]If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
[p]Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
[p]Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
[p]With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
[p]And I of him will gather patience.
[p]But there is no such man: for, brother, men
[p]Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
[p]Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
[p]Their counsel turns to passion, which before
[p]Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
[p]Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
[p]Charm ache with air and agony with words:
[p]No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
[p]To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
[p]But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
[p]To be so moral when he shall endure
[p]The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
[p]My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
"
"Therein do men from children nothing differ.
"
"I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;
[p]For there was never yet philosopher
[p]That could endure the toothache patiently,
[p]However they have writ the style of gods
[p]And made a push at chance and sufferance.
"
"Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
[p]Make those that do offend you suffer too.
"
"There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.
[p]My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
[p]And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince
[p]And all of them that thus dishonour her.
"
"Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.
"
"Good den, good den.
"
"Good day to both of you.
"
"Hear you. my lords,--
"
"We have some haste, Leonato.
"
"Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
[p]Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.
"
"Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
"
"If he could right himself with quarreling,
[p]Some of us would lie low.
"
"Who wrongs him?
"
"Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--
[p]Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
[p]I fear thee not.
"
"Marry, beshrew my hand,
[p]If it should give your age such cause of fear:
[p]In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
"
"Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:
[p]I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
[p]As under privilege of age to brag
[p]What I have done being young, or what would do
[p]Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
[p]Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
[p]That I am forced to lay my reverence by
[p]And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
[p]Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
[p]I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
[p]Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
[p]And she lies buried with her ancestors;
[p]O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
[p]Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!
"
"My villany?
"
"Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.
"
"You say not right, old man.
"
"My lord, my lord,
[p]I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
[p]Despite his nice fence and his active practise,
[p]His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.
"
"Away! I will not have to do with you.
"
"Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
[p]If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
"
"He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
[p]But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
[p]Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
[p]Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:
[p]Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
[p]Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
"
"Brother,--
"
"Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
[p]And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
[p]That dare as well answer a man indeed
[p]As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:
[p]Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!
"
"Brother Antony,--
"
"Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
[p]And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--
[p]Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
[p]That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
[p]Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
[p]And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
[p]How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
[p]And this is all.
"
"But, brother Antony,--
"
"Come, 'tis no matter:
[p]Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
"
"Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
[p]My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
[p]But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing
[p]But what was true and very full of proof.
"
"My lord, my lord,--
"
"I will not hear you.
"
"No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.
"
"And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
"
"See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
"
"Now, signior, what news?
"
"Good day, my lord.
"
"Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
[p]almost a fray.
"
"We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
[p]with two old men without teeth.
"
"Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
[p]we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
"
"In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
[p]to seek you both.
"
"We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are
[p]high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
[p]away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
"
"It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?
"
"Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
"
"Never any did so, though very many have been beside
[p]their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
[p]minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.
"
"As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou
[p]sick, or angry?
"
"What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,
[p]thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
"
"Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you
[p]charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.
"
"Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was
[p]broke cross.
"
"By this light, he changes more and more: I think
[p]he be angry indeed.
"
"If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
"
"Shall I speak a word in your ear?
"
"God bless me from a challenge!
"
"[Aside to CLAUDIO] You are a villain; I jest not:
[p]I will make it good how you dare, with what you
[p]dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will
[p]protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet
[p]lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me
[p]hear from you.
"
"Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
"
"What, a feast, a feast?
"
"I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's
[p]head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most
[p]curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find
[p]a woodcock too?
"
"Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
"
"I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
[p]other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
[p]said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
[p]great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
[p]'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
[p]hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
[p]is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
[p]'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
[p]believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
[p]Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
[p]there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
[p]did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
[p]virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
[p]wast the properest man in Italy.
"
"For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
[p]not.
"
"Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
[p]did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
[p]the old man's daughter told us all.
"
"All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was
[p]hid in the garden.
"
"But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
[p]the sensible Benedick's head?
"
"Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the
[p]married man'?
"
"Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave
[p]you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
[p]as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
[p]hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
[p]you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
[p]the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
[p]you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord
[p]Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
[p]then, peace be with him.
"
"He is in earnest.
"
"In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for
[p]the love of Beatrice.
"
"And hath challenged thee.
"
"Most sincerely.
"
"What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
[p]doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!
"
"He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a
[p]doctor to such a man.
"
"But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and
[p]be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?
"
"Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she
[p]shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,
[p]an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.
"
"How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio
[p]one!
"
"Hearken after their offence, my lord.
"
"Officers, what offence have these men done?
"
"Marry, sir, they have committed false report;
[p]moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
[p]they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have
[p]belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust
[p]things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
"
"First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I
[p]ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why
[p]they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay
[p]to their charge.
"
"Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by
[p]my troth, there's one meaning well suited.
"
"Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus
[p]bound to your answer? this learned constable is
[p]too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?
"
"Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:
[p]do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
[p]deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
[p]could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
[p]to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
[p]to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
[p]to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
[p]the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
[p]garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
[p]marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
[p]I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
[p]to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
[p]master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire
[p]nothing but the reward of a villain.
"
"Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
"
"I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.
"
"But did my brother set thee on to this?
"
"Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.
"
"He is composed and framed of treachery:
[p]And fled he is upon this villany.
"
"Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
[p]In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
"
"Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our
[p]sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
[p]and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time
[p]and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
"
"Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the
[p]Sexton too.
"
"Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,
[p]That, when I note another man like him,
[p]I may avoid him: which of these is he?
"
"If you would know your wronger, look on me.
"
"Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
[p]Mine innocent child?
"
"Yea, even I alone.
"
"No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
[p]Here stand a pair of honourable men;
[p]A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
[p]I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
[p]Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
[p]'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
"
"I know not how to pray your patience;
[p]Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
[p]Impose me to what penance your invention
[p]Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
[p]But in mistaking.
"
"By my soul, nor I:
[p]And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
[p]I would bend under any heavy weight
[p]That he'll enjoin me to.
"
"I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
[p]That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
[p]Possess the people in Messina here
[p]How innocent she died; and if your love
[p]Can labour ought in sad invention,
[p]Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
[p]And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:
[p]To-morrow morning come you to my house,
[p]And since you could not be my son-in-law,
[p]Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
[p]Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
[p]And she alone is heir to both of us:
[p]Give her the right you should have given her cousin,
[p]And so dies my revenge.
"
"O noble sir,
[p]Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
[p]I do embrace your offer; and dispose
[p]For henceforth of poor Claudio.
"
"To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
[p]To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
[p]Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
[p]Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,
[p]Hired to it by your brother.
"
"No, by my soul, she was not,
[p]Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
[p]But always hath been just and virtuous
[p]In any thing that I do know by her.
"
"Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
[p]black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
[p]me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his
[p]punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
[p]one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and
[p]a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's
[p]name, the which he hath used so long and never paid
[p]that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing
[p]for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.
"
"I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
"
"Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
[p]reverend youth; and I praise God for you.
"
"There's for thy pains.
"
"God save the foundation!
"
"Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
"
"I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I
[p]beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the
[p]example of others. God keep your worship! I wish
[p]your worship well; God restore you to health! I
[p]humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry
[p]meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.
"
"Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
"
"Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.
"
"We will not fail.
"
"To-night I'll mourn with Hero.
"
"[To the Watch] Bring you these fellows on. We'll
[p]talk with Margaret,
[p]How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
"
"Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at
[p]my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
"
"Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
"
"In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
[p]shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
[p]deservest it.
"
"To have no man come over me! why, shall I always
[p]keep below stairs?
"
"Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
"
"And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,
[p]but hurt not.
"
"A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a
[p]woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
[p]thee the bucklers.
"
"Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
"
"If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
[p]pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
"
"Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
"
"And therefore will come.
[p][Exit MARGARET]
[p][Sings]
[p]The god of love,
[p]That sits above,
[p]And knows me, and knows me,
[p]How pitiful I deserve,--
[p]I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
[p]swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
[p]a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
[p]whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
[p]blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
[p]over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
[p]cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
[p]out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
[p]rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
[p]'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
[p]endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
[p]nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
[p][Enter BEATRICE]
[p]Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
"
"Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.
"
"O, stay but till then!
"
"'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
[p]I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
[p]knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
"
"Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
"
"Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
[p]foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
[p]will depart unkissed.
"
"Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
[p]so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
[p]plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
[p]I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
[p]him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
[p]which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
"
"For them all together; which maintained so politic
[p]a state of evil that they will not admit any good
[p]part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
[p]good parts did you first suffer love for me?
"
"Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
[p]indeed, for I love thee against my will.
"
"In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
[p]If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
[p]yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.
"
"Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
"
"It appears not in this confession: there's not one
[p]wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
"
"An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
[p]the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
[p]in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
[p]no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
[p]widow weeps.
"
"And how long is that, think you?
"
"Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
[p]rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
[p]wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
[p]impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
[p]own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
[p]praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
[p]praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?
"
"Very ill.
"
"And how do you?
"
"Very ill too.
"
"Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
[p]you too, for here comes one in haste.
"
"Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old
[p]coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
[p]falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
[p]abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
[p]fed and gone. Will you come presently?
"
"Will you go hear this news, signior?
"
"I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
[p]buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
[p]thee to thy uncle's.
"
"Is this the monument of Leonato?
"
"It is, my lord.
"
"[Reading out of a scroll]
[p]Done to death by slanderous tongues
[p]Was the Hero that here lies:
[p]Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
[p]Gives her fame which never dies.
[p]So the life that died with shame
[p]Lives in death with glorious fame.
[p]Hang thou there upon the tomb,
[p]Praising her when I am dumb.
[p]Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
[p]SONG.
[p]Pardon, goddess of the night,
[p]Those that slew thy virgin knight;
[p]For the which, with songs of woe,
[p]Round about her tomb they go.
[p]Midnight, assist our moan;
[p]Help us to sigh and groan,
[p]Heavily, heavily:
[p]Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
[p]Till death be uttered,
[p]Heavily, heavily.
"
"Now, unto thy bones good night!
[p]Yearly will I do this rite.
"
"Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
[p]The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
[p]Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
[p]Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
[p]Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.
"
"Good morrow, masters: each his several way.
"
"Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
[p]And then to Leonato's we will go.
"
"And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
[p]Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.
"
"Did I not tell you she was innocent?
"
"So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
[p]Upon the error that you heard debated:
[p]But Margaret was in some fault for this,
[p]Although against her will, as it appears
[p]In the true course of all the question.
"
"Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
"
"And so am I, being else by faith enforced
[p]To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
"
"Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,
[p]Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
[p]And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.
[p][Exeunt Ladies]
[p]The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
[p]To visit me. You know your office, brother:
[p]You must be father to your brother's daughter
[p]And give her to young Claudio.
"
"Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
"
"Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
"
"To do what, signior?
"
"To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
[p]Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
[p]Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
"
"That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
"
"And I do with an eye of love requite her.
"
"The sight whereof I think you had from me,
[p]From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?
"
"Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
[p]But, for my will, my will is your good will
[p]May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
[p]In the state of honourable marriage:
[p]In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.
"
"My heart is with your liking.
"
"And my help.
[p]Here comes the prince and Claudio.
"
"Good morrow to this fair assembly.
"
"Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
[p]We here attend you. Are you yet determined
[p]To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?
"
"I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.
"
"Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.
"
"Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
[p]That you have such a February face,
[p]So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?
"
"I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
[p]Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
[p]And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
[p]As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
[p]When he would play the noble beast in love.
"
"Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
[p]And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
[p]And got a calf in that same noble feat
[p]Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.
"
"For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.
[p][Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked]
[p]Which is the lady I must seize upon?
"
"This same is she, and I do give you her.
"
"Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.
"
"No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
[p]Before this friar and swear to marry her.
"
"Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
[p]I am your husband, if you like of me.
"
"And when I lived, I was your other wife:
[p][Unmasking]
[p]And when you loved, you were my other husband.
"
"Another Hero!
"
"Nothing certainer:
[p]One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
[p]And surely as I live, I am a maid.
"
"The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
"
"She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
"
"All this amazement can I qualify:
[p]When after that the holy rites are ended,
[p]I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
[p]Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
[p]And to the chapel let us presently.
"
"Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?
"
"[Unmasking] I answer to that name. What is your will?
"
"Do not you love me?
"
"Why, no; no more than reason.
"
"Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
[p]Have been deceived; they swore you did.
"
"Do not you love me?
"
"Troth, no; no more than reason.
"
"Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
[p]Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.
"
"They swore that you were almost sick for me.
"
"They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
"
"'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
"
"No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
"
"Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
"
"And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
[p]For here's a paper written in his hand,
[p]A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
[p]Fashion'd to Beatrice.
"
"And here's another
[p]Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
[p]Containing her affection unto Benedick.
"
"A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
[p]Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take
[p]thee for pity.
"
"I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield
[p]upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
[p]for I was told you were in a consumption.
"
"Peace! I will stop your mouth.
"
"How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
"
"I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
[p]wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
[p]thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:
[p]if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
[p]nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
[p]purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
[p]purpose that the world can say against it; and
[p]therefore never flout at me for what I have said
[p]against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
[p]conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
[p]have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
[p]kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.
"
"I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
[p]that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
[p]life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
[p]question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
[p]exceedingly narrowly to thee.
"
"Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
[p]we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
[p]and our wives' heels.
"
"We'll have dancing afterward.
"
"First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
[p]thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:
[p]there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.
"
"My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
[p]And brought with armed men back to Messina.
"
"Think not on him till to-morrow:
[p]I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.
[p]Strike up, pipers.
"
"I'll pheeze you, in faith.
"
"A pair of stocks, you rogue!
"
"Y'are a baggage; the Slys are no rogues. Look in the
[p]chronicles: we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, paucas
[p]pallabris; let the world slide. Sessa!
"
"You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
"
"No, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed
[p]and warm thee.
"
"I know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.
"
"Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him by law.
[p]I'll not budge an inch, boy; let him come, and kindly.
[p][Falls asleep]
[p]   Wind horns. Enter a LORD from hunting, with his train
"
"Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
[p]Brach Merriman, the poor cur, is emboss'd;
[p]And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
[p]Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
[p]At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?
[p]I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
"
"Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
[p]He cried upon it at the merest loss,
[p]And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent;
[p]Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
"
"Thou art a fool; if Echo were as fleet,
[p]I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
[p]But sup them well, and look unto them all;
[p]To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
"
"I will, my lord.
"
"What's here? One dead, or drunk?
[p]See, doth he breathe?
"
"He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
[p]This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
"
"O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
[p]Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
[p]Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
[p]What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
[p]Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
[p]A most delicious banquet by his bed,
[p]And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
[p]Would not the beggar then forget himself?
"
"Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
"
"It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd.
"
"Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.
[p]Then take him up, and manage well the jest:
[p]Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
[p]And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
[p]Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
[p]And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
[p]Procure me music ready when he wakes,
[p]To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
[p]And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
[p]And with a low submissive reverence
[p]Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
[p]Let one attend him with a silver basin
[p]Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;
[p]Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
[p]And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
[p]Some one be ready with a costly suit,
[p]And ask him what apparel he will wear;
[p]Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
[p]And that his lady mourns at his disease;
[p]Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
[p]And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,
[p]For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
[p]This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
[p]It will be pastime passing excellent,
[p]If it be husbanded with modesty.
"
"My lord, I warrant you we will play our part
[p]As he shall think by our true diligence
[p]He is no less than what we say he is.
"
"Take him up gently, and to bed with him;
[p]And each one to his office when he wakes.
[p][SLY is carried out. A trumpet sounds]
[p]Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
[p][Exit SERVANT]
[p]Belike some noble gentleman that means,
[p]Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
[p][Re-enter a SERVINGMAN]
[p]How now! who is it?
"
"An't please your honour, players
[p]That offer service to your lordship.
"
"Bid them come near.
[p]Now, fellows, you are welcome.
"
"We thank your honour.
"
"Do you intend to stay with me to-night?
"
"So please your lordship to accept our duty.
"
"With all my heart. This fellow I remember
[p]Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son;
[p]'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.
[p]I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
[p]Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
"
"I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
"
"'Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.
[p]Well, you are come to me in happy time,
[p]The rather for I have some sport in hand
[p]Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
[p]There is a lord will hear you play to-night;
[p]But I am doubtful of your modesties,
[p]Lest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,
[p]For yet his honour never heard a play,
[p]You break into some merry passion
[p]And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
[p]If you should smile, he grows impatient.
"
"Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,
[p]Were he the veriest antic in the world.
"
"Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
[p]And give them friendly welcome every one;
[p]Let them want nothing that my house affords.
[p][Exit one with the PLAYERS]
[p]Sirrah, go you to Bartholomew my page,
[p]And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady;
[p]That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber,
[p]And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
[p]Tell him from me- as he will win my love-
[p]He bear himself with honourable action,
[p]Such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies
[p]Unto their lords, by them accomplished;
[p]Such duty to the drunkard let him do,
[p]With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
[p]And say 'What is't your honour will command,
[p]Wherein your lady and your humble wife
[p]May show her duty and make known her love?'
[p]And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
[p]And with declining head into his bosom,
[p]Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
[p]To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
[p]Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
[p]No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
[p]And if the boy have not a woman's gift
[p]To rain a shower of commanded tears,
[p]An onion will do well for such a shift,
[p]Which, in a napkin being close convey'd,
[p]Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
[p]See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst;
[p]Anon I'll give thee more instructions. Exit a SERVINGMAN
[p]I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
[p]Voice, gait, and action, of a gentlewoman;
[p]I long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband';
[p]And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
[p]When they do homage to this simple peasant.
[p]I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
[p]May well abate the over-merry spleen,
[p]Which otherwise would grow into extremes.        Exeunt
"
"For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
"
"Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
"
"Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?
"
"What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
"
"I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor 'lordship.' I
[p]ne'er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves,
[p]give me conserves of beef. Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear,
[p]for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than
[p]legs, nor no more shoes than feet- nay, sometime more feet than
[p]shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.
"
"Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
[p]O, that a mighty man of such descent,
[p]Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
[p]Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
"
"What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old
[p]Sly's son of Burton Heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a
[p]cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present
[p]profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of
[p]Wincot, if she know me not; if she say I am not fourteen pence on
[p]the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lying'st knave in
[p]Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. [Taking a pot of ale]
[p]Here's-
"
"O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
"
"O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
"
"Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
[p]As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
[p]O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!
[p]Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
[p]And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
[p]Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
[p]Each in his office ready at thy beck.
[p]Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,            [Music]
[p]And twenty caged nightingales do sing.
[p]Or wilt thou sleep? We'll have thee to a couch
[p]Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
[p]On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
[p]Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground.
[p]Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp'd,
[p]Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
[p]Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
[p]Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?
[p]Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
[p]And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth.
"
"Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
[p]As breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.
"
"Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee
[p]  straight
[p]Adonis painted by a running brook,
[p]And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
[p]Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
[p]Even as the waving sedges play wi' th' wind.
"
"We'll show thee Io as she was a maid
[p]And how she was beguiled and surpris'd,
[p]As lively painted as the deed was done.
"
"Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
[p]Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds
[p]And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
[p]So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
"
"Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord.
[p]Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
[p]Than any woman in this waning age.
"
"And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee
[p]Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
[p]She was the fairest creature in the world;
[p]And yet she is inferior to none.
"
"Am I a lord and have I such a lady?
[p]Or do I dream? Or have I dream'd till now?
[p]I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
[p]I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things.
[p]Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,
[p]And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.
[p]Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
[p]And once again, a pot o' th' smallest ale.
"
"Will't please your Mightiness to wash your hands?
[p]O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
[p]O, that once more you knew but what you are!
[p]These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
[p]Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
"
"These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
[p]But did I never speak of all that time?
"
"O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;
[p]For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
[p]Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
[p]And rail upon the hostess of the house,
[p]And say you would present her at the leet,
[p]Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts.
[p]Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
"
"Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
"
"Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
[p]Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
[p]As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
[p]And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;
[p]And twenty more such names and men as these,
[p]Which never were, nor no man ever saw.
"
"Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!
"
"Amen.
"
"I thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.
"
"How fares my noble lord?
"
"Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.
[p]Where is my wife?
"
"Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?
"
"Are you my wife, and will not call me husband?
[p]My men should call me 'lord'; I am your goodman.
"
"My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
[p]I am your wife in all obedience.
"
"I know it well. What must I call her?
"
"Madam.
"
"Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
"
"Madam, and nothing else; so lords call ladies.
"
"Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
[p]And slept above some fifteen year or more.
"
"Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
[p]Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
"
"'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
[p][Exeunt SERVANTS]
[p]Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
"
"Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
[p]To pardon me yet for a night or two;
[p]Or, if not so, until the sun be set.
[p]For your physicians have expressly charg'd,
[p]In peril to incur your former malady,
[p]That I should yet absent me from your bed.
[p]I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
"
"Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long. But I would be
[p]loath to fall into my dreams again. I will therefore tarry in
[p]despite of the flesh and the blood.
"
"Your honour's players, hearing your amendment,
[p]Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
[p]For so your doctors hold it very meet,
[p]Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
[p]And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.
[p]Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
[p]And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
[p]Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
"
"Marry, I will; let them play it. Is not a comonty a
[p]Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
"
"No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
"
"What, household stuff?
"
"It is a kind of history.
"
"Well, we'll see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let
[p]the world slip;-we shall ne'er be younger.
"
"Tranio, since for the great desire I had
[p]To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
[p]I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,
[p]The pleasant garden of great Italy,
[p]And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
[p]With his good will and thy good company,
[p]My trusty servant well approv'd in all,
[p]Here let us breathe, and haply institute
[p]A course of learning and ingenious studies.
[p]Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
[p]Gave me my being and my father first,
[p]A merchant of great traffic through the world,
[p]Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;
[p]Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
[p]It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,
[p]To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.
[p]And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
[p]Virtue and that part of philosophy
[p]Will I apply that treats of happiness
[p]By virtue specially to be achiev'd.
[p]Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
[p]And am to Padua come as he that leaves
[p]A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
[p]And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
"
"Mi perdonato, gentle master mine;
[p]I am in all affected as yourself;
[p]Glad that you thus continue your resolve
[p]To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
[p]Only, good master, while we do admire
[p]This virtue and this moral discipline,
[p]Let's be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,
[p]Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
[p]As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
[p]Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
[p]And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
[p]Music and poesy use to quicken you;
[p]The mathematics and the metaphysics,
[p]Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.
[p]No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
[p]In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
"
"Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
[p]If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
[p]We could at once put us in readiness,
[p]And take a lodging fit to entertain
[p]Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
[p]  Enter BAPTISTA with his two daughters, KATHERINA
[p]    and BIANCA; GREMIO, a pantaloon; HORTENSIO,
[p]    suitor to BIANCA. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by
[p]But stay awhile; what company is this?
"
"Master, some show to welcome us to town.
"
"Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
[p]For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;
[p]That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
[p]Before I have a husband for the elder.
[p]If either of you both love Katherina,
[p]Because I know you well and love you well,
[p]Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
"
"To cart her rather. She's too rough for me.
[p]There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?
"
"[To BAPTISTA]  I pray you, sir, is it your will
[p]To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
"
"Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,
[p]Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
"
"I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;
[p]Iwis it is not halfway to her heart;
[p]But if it were, doubt not her care should be
[p]To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
[p]And paint your face, and use you like a fool.
"
"From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
"
"And me, too, good Lord!
"
"Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;
[p]That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
"
"But in the other's silence do I see
[p]Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.
[p]Peace, Tranio!
"
"Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
"
"Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
[p]What I have said- Bianca, get you in;
[p]And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
[p]For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
"
"A pretty peat! it is best
[p]Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
"
"Sister, content you in my discontent.
[p]Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe;
[p]My books and instruments shall be my company,
[p]On them to look, and practise by myself.
"
"Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!
"
"Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
[p]Sorry am I that our good will effects
[p]Bianca's grief.
"
"Why will you mew her up,
[p]Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
[p]And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
"
"Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
[p]Go in, Bianca.                              Exit BIANCA
[p]And for I know she taketh most delight
[p]In music, instruments, and poetry,
[p]Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
[p]Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
[p]Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
[p]Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
[p]I will be very kind, and liberal
[p]To mine own children in good bringing-up;
[p]And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;
[p]For I have more to commune with Bianca.            Exit
"
"Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
[p]What! shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike,
[p]I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!          Exit
"
"You may go to the devil's dam; your gifts are so good
[p]here's none will hold you. There! Love is not so great,
[p]Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly
[p]out; our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell; yet, for the love
[p]I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man
[p]to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her
[p]father.
"
"So Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray. Though
[p]the nature of our quarrel yet never brook'd parle, know now, upon
[p]advice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have access to
[p]our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca's love- to
[p]labour and effect one thing specially.
"
"What's that, I pray?
"
"Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
"
"A husband? a devil.
"
"I say a husband.
"
"I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her father
[p]be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?
"
"Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to
[p]endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the
[p]world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all
[p]faults, and money enough.
"
"I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this
[p]condition: to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning.
"
"Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
[p]apples. But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it
[p]shall be so far forth friendly maintain'd till by helping
[p]Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free
[p]for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
[p]be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you,
[p]Signior Gremio?
"
"I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in
[p]Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her,
[p]and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.
"
"I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
[p]That love should of a sudden take such hold?
"
"O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
[p]I never thought it possible or likely.
[p]But see! while idly I stood looking on,
[p]I found the effect of love in idleness;
[p]And now in plainness do confess to thee,
[p]That art to me as secret and as dear
[p]As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was-
[p]Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
[p]If I achieve not this young modest girl.
[p]Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
[p]Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
"
"Master, it is no time to chide you now;
[p]Affection is not rated from the heart;
[p]If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so:
[p]'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
"
"Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
[p]The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
"
"Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.
[p]Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
"
"O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
[p]Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
[p]That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
[p]When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
"
"Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how her sister
[p]Began to scold and raise up such a storm
[p]That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
"
"Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
[p]And with her breath she did perfume the air;
[p]Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
"
"Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
[p]I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,
[p]Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
[p]Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
[p]That, till the father rid his hands of her,
[p]Master, your love must live a maid at home;
[p]And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
[p]Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
"
"Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
[p]But art thou not advis'd he took some care
[p]To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
"
"Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.
"
"I have it, Tranio.
"
"Master, for my hand,
[p]Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
"
"Tell me thine first.
"
"You will be schoolmaster,
[p]And undertake the teaching of the maid-
[p]That's your device.
"
"It is. May it be done?
"
"Not possible; for who shall bear your part
[p]And be in Padua here Vincentio's son;
[p]Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
[p]Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
"
"Basta, content thee, for I have it full.
[p]We have not yet been seen in any house,
[p]Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
[p]For man or master. Then it follows thus:
[p]Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
[p]Keep house and port and servants, as I should;
[p]I will some other be- some Florentine,
[p]Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
[p]'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
[p]Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
[p]When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
[p]But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
"
"So had you need.           [They exchange habits]
[p]In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
[p]And I am tied to be obedient-
[p]For so your father charg'd me at our parting:
[p]'Be serviceable to my son' quoth he,
[p]Although I think 'twas in another sense-
[p]I am content to be Lucentio,
[p]Because so well I love Lucentio.
"
"Tranio, be so because Lucentio loves;
[p]And let me be a slave t' achieve that maid
[p]Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
[p][Enter BIONDELLO.]
[p]Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?
"
"Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
[p]Master, has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes?
[p]Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news?
"
"Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
[p]And therefore frame your manners to the time.
[p]Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
[p]Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
[p]And I for my escape have put on his;
[p]For in a quarrel since I came ashore
[p]I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried.
[p]Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
[p]While I make way from hence to save my life.
[p]You understand me?
"
"I, sir? Ne'er a whit.
"
"And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
[p]Tranio is chang'd into Lucentio.
"
"The better for him; would I were so too!
"
"So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
[p]That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
[p]But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master's, I advise
[p]You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.
[p]When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
[p]But in all places else your master Lucentio.
"
"Tranio, let's go.
[p]One thing more rests, that thyself execute-
[p]To make one among these wooers. If thou ask me why-
[p]Sufficeth, my reasons are both good and weighty. Exeunt.
"
"My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
"
"Yes, by Saint Anne do I. A good matter, surely; comes there
[p]any more of it?
"
"My lord, 'tis but begun.
"
"'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady
[p]Would 'twere done!                        [They sit and mark]
"
"Verona, for a while I take my leave,
[p]To see my friends in Padua; but of all
[p]My best beloved and approved friend,
[p]Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
[p]Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.
"
"Knock, sir! Whom should I knock?
[p]Is there any man has rebus'd your worship?
"
"Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
"
"Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I
[p]should knock you here, sir?
"
"Villain, I say, knock me at this gate,
[p]And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
"
"My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,
[p]And then I know after who comes by the worst.
"
"Will it not be?
[p]Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock I'll ring it;
[p]I'll try how you can sol-fa, and sing it.
"
"Help, masters, help! My master is mad.
"
"Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
"
"How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and my
[p]good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
"
"Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
[p]'Con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may I say.
"
"Alla nostra casa ben venuto,
[p]Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.
[p]Rise, Grumio, rise; we will compound this quarrel.
"
"Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. If this
[p]be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service- look you, sir:
[p]he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit
[p]for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I
[p]see, two and thirty, a pip out?
[p]Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,
[p]Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
"
"A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
[p]I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
[p]And could not get him for my heart to do it.
"
"Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words
[p]plain: 'Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and
[p]knock me soundly'? And come you now with 'knocking at the gate'?
"
"Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
"
"Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge;
[p]Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
[p]Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
[p]And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
[p]Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
"
"Such wind as scatters young men through the world
[p]To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
[p]Where small experience grows. But in a few,
[p]Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
[p]Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
[p]And I have thrust myself into this maze,
[p]Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;
[p]Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
[p]And so am come abroad to see the world.
"
"Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
[p]And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
[p]Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel,
[p]And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
[p]And very rich; but th'art too much my friend,
[p]And I'll not wish thee to her.
"
"Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
[p]Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
[p]One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
[p]As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
[p]Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
[p]As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
[p]As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse-
[p]She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
[p]Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
[p]As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
[p]I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
[p]If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
"
"Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is.
[p]Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an
[p]aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though
[p]she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing
[p]comes amiss, so money comes withal.
"
"Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
[p]I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
[p]I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
[p]With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;
[p]Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;
[p]Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
[p]Is- that she is intolerable curst,
[p]And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
[p]That, were my state far worser than it is,
[p]I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
"
"Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect.
[p]Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
[p]For I will board her though she chide as loud
[p]As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
"
"Her father is Baptista Minola,
[p]An affable and courteous gentleman;
[p]Her name is Katherina Minola,
[p]Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
"
"I know her father, though I know not her;
[p]And he knew my deceased father well.
[p]I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
[p]And therefore let me be thus bold with you
[p]To give you over at this first encounter,
[p]Unless you will accompany me thither.
"
"I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O' my
[p]word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding
[p]would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a
[p]score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; and he begin once, he'll
[p]rail in his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what, sir: an she stand
[p]him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so
[p]disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see
[p]withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
"
"Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
[p]For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.
[p]He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
[p]His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca;
[p]And her withholds from me, and other more,
[p]Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
[p]Supposing it a thing impossible-
[p]For those defects I have before rehears'd-
[p]That ever Katherina will be woo'd.
[p]Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
[p]That none shall have access unto Bianca
[p]Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.
"
"Katherine the curst!
[p]A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
"
"Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
[p]And offer me disguis'd in sober robes
[p]To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
[p]Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
[p]That so I may by this device at least
[p]Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
[p]And unsuspected court her by herself.
[p]    Enter GREMIO with LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO
"
"Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the
[p]young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look about
[p]you. Who goes there, ha?
"
"Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio,
[p]stand by awhile.
"
"A proper stripling, and an amorous!
"
"O, very well; I have perus'd the note.
[p]Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound-
[p]All books of love, see that at any hand;
[p]And see you read no other lectures to her.
[p]You understand me- over and beside
[p]Signior Baptista's liberality,
[p]I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
[p]And let me have them very well perfum'd;
[p]For she is sweeter than perfume itself
[p]To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
"
"Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
[p]As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,
[p]As firmly as yourself were still in place;
[p]Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
[p]Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
"
"O this learning, what a thing it is!
"
"O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
"
"Peace, sirrah!
"
"Grumio, mum!                       [Coming forward]
[p]God save you, Signior Gremio!
"
"And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
[p]Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
[p]I promis'd to enquire carefully
[p]About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;
[p]And by good fortune I have lighted well
[p]On this young man; for learning and behaviour
[p]Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
[p]And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.
"
"'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
[p]Hath promis'd me to help me to another,
[p]A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
[p]So shall I no whit be behind in duty
[p]To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
"
"Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.
"
"And that his bags shall prove.
"
"Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
[p]Listen to me, and if you speak me fair
[p]I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
[p]Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
[p]Upon agreement from us to his liking,
[p]Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;
[p]Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
"
"So said, so done, is well.
[p]Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
"
"I know she is an irksome brawling scold;
[p]If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
"
"No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
"
"Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.
[p]My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
[p]And I do hope good days and long to see.
"
"O Sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
[p]But if you have a stomach, to't a God's name;
[p]You shall have me assisting you in all.
[p]But will you woo this wild-cat?
"
"Will I live?
"
"Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.
"
"Why came I hither but to that intent?
[p]Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
[p]Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
[p]Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
[p]Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
[p]Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
[p]And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
[p]Have I not in a pitched battle heard
[p]Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
[p]And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
[p]That gives not half so great a blow to hear
[p]As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
[p]Tush! tush! fear boys with bugs.
"
"For he fears none.
"
"Hortensio, hark:
[p]This gentleman is happily arriv'd,
[p]My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
"
"I promis'd we would be contributors
[p]And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.
"
"And so we will- provided that he win her.
"
"I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
[p]Enter TRANIO, bravely apparelled as LUCENTIO, and BIONDELLO
"
"Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,
[p]Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
[p]To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
"
"He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you mean?
"
"Even he, Biondello.
"
"Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-
"
"Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?
"
"Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
"
"I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
"
"[Aside]  Well begun, Tranio.
"
"Sir, a word ere you go.
[p]Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
"
"And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
"
"No; if without more words you will get you hence.
"
"Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
[p]For me as for you?
"
"But so is not she.
"
"For what reason, I beseech you?
"
"For this reason, if you'll know,
[p]That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
"
"That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
"
"Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,
[p]Do me this right- hear me with patience.
[p]Baptista is a noble gentleman,
[p]To whom my father is not all unknown,
[p]And, were his daughter fairer than she is,
[p]She may more suitors have, and me for one.
[p]Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
[p]Then well one more may fair Bianca have;
[p]And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,
[p]Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
"
"What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!
"
"Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.
"
"Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
"
"Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
[p]Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
"
"No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:
[p]The one as famous for a scolding tongue
[p]As is the other for beauteous modesty.
"
"Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
"
"Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
[p]And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
"
"Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
[p]The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
[p]Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
[p]And will not promise her to any man
[p]Until the elder sister first be wed.
[p]The younger then is free, and not before.
"
"If it be so, sir, that you are the man
[p]Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;
[p]And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
[p]Achieve the elder, set the younger free
[p]For our access- whose hap shall be to have her
[p]Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
"
"Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
[p]And since you do profess to be a suitor,
[p]You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
[p]To whom we all rest generally beholding.
"
"Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
[p]Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
[p]And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;
[p]And do as adversaries do in law-
[p]Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
"
"[with BIONDELLO:] O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
"
"The motion's good indeed, and be it so.
[p]Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.           Exeunt
"
"Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
[p]To make a bondmaid and a slave of me-
[p]That I disdain; but for these other gawds,
[p]Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
[p]Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
[p]Or what you will command me will I do,
[p]So well I know my duty to my elders.
"
"Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
[p]Whom thou lov'st best. See thou dissemble not.
"
"Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
[p]I never yet beheld that special face
[p]Which I could fancy more than any other.
"
"Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
"
"If you affect him, sister, here I swear
[p]I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him.
"
"O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
[p]You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
"
"Is it for him you do envy me so?
[p]Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive
[p]You have but jested with me all this while.
[p]I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
"
"[Strikes her]  If that be jest, then an the rest was so.
"
"Why, how now, dame! Whence grows this insolence?
[p]Bianca, stand aside- poor girl! she weeps.
[p][He unbinds her]
[p]Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
[p]For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
[p]Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
[p]When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
"
"Her silence flouts me, and I'll be reveng'd.
"
"What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
"
"What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
[p]She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
[p]I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,
[p]And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
[p]Talk not to me; I will go sit and weep,
[p]Till I can find occasion of revenge.     Exit KATHERINA
"
"Was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I?
[p]But who comes here?
"
"Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
"
"Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
[p]God save you, gentlemen!
"
"And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
[p]Call'd Katherina, fair and virtuous?
"
"I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katherina.
"
"You are too blunt; go to it orderly.
"
"You wrong me, Signior Gremio; give me leave.
[p]I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
[p]That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
[p]Her affability and bashful modesty,
[p]Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
[p]Am bold to show myself a forward guest
[p]Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
[p]Of that report which I so oft have heard.
[p]And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
[p]I do present you with a man of mine,
[p][Presenting HORTENSIO]
[p]Cunning in music and the mathematics,
[p]To instruct her fully in those sciences,
[p]Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
[p]Accept of him, or else you do me wrong-
[p]His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
"
"Y'are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;
[p]But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,
[p]She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
"
"I see you do not mean to part with her;
[p]Or else you like not of my company.
"
"Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
[p]Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?
"
"Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,
[p]A man well known throughout all Italy.
"
"I know him well; you are welcome for his sake.
"
"Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
[p]Let us that are poor petitioners speak too.
[p]Bacare! you are marvellous forward.
"
"O, pardon me, Signior Gremio! I would fain be doing.
"
"I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
[p]Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To
[p]express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly
[p]beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young
[p]scholar  [Presenting LUCENTIO]  that hath been long studying at
[p]Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the
[p]other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray accept
[p]his service.
"
"A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio.
[p][To TRANIO]  But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger.
[p]May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
"
"Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
[p]That, being a stranger in this city here,
[p]Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
[p]Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
[p]Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
[p]In the preferment of the eldest sister.
[p]This liberty is all that I request-
[p]That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
[p]I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
[p]And free access and favour as the rest.
[p]And toward the education of your daughters
[p]I here bestow a simple instrument,
[p]And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.
[p]If you accept them, then their worth is great.
"
"Lucentio is your name? Of whence, I pray?
"
"Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
"
"A mighty man of Pisa. By report
[p]I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.
[p]Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
[p]You shall go see your pupils presently.
[p]Holla, within!
[p][Enter a SERVANT]
[p]Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
[p]To my daughters; and tell them both
[p]These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.
[p][Exit SERVANT leading HORTENSIO carrying the lute and LUCENTIO with the books]
[p]We will go walk a little in the orchard,
[p]And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
[p]And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
"
"Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
[p]And every day I cannot come to woo.
[p]You knew my father well, and in him me,
[p]Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
[p]Which I have bettered rather than decreas'd.
[p]Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
[p]What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
"
"After my death, the one half of my lands
[p]And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
"
"And for that dowry, I'll assure her of
[p]Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
[p]In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
[p]Let specialities be therefore drawn between us,
[p]That covenants may be kept on either hand.
"
"Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
[p]That is, her love; for that is all in all.
"
"Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
[p]I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
[p]And where two raging fires meet together,
[p]They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
[p]Though little fire grows great with little wind,
[p]Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
[p]So I to her, and so she yields to me;
[p]For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.
"
"Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed
[p]But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
"
"Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
[p]That shake not though they blow perpetually.
"
"How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?
"
"For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
"
"What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
"
"I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
[p]Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
"
"Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
"
"Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
[p]I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
[p]And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,
[p]When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
[p]'Frets, call you these?' quoth she 'I'll fume with them.'
[p]And with that word she struck me on the head,
[p]And through the instrument my pate made way;
[p]And there I stood amazed for a while,
[p]As on a pillory, looking through the lute,
[p]While she did call me rascal fiddler
[p]And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,
[p]As she had studied to misuse me so.
"
"Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
[p]I love her ten times more than e'er I did.
[p]O, how I long to have some chat with her!
"
"Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;
[p]Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
[p]She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
[p]Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
[p]Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
"
"I pray you do.        Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
[p]I'll attend her here,
[p]And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
[p]Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain
[p]She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
[p]Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
[p]As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.
[p]Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;
[p]Then I'll commend her volubility,
[p]And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.
[p]If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
[p]As though she bid me stay by her a week;
[p]If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
[p]When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
[p]But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
[p][Enter KATHERINA]
[p]Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.
"
"Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
[p]They call me Katherine that do talk of me.
"
"You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
[p]And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
[p]But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
[p]Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
[p]For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
[p]Take this of me, Kate of my consolation-
[p]Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
[p]Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
[p]Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
[p]Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.
"
"Mov'd! in good time! Let him that mov'd you hither
[p]Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
[p]You were a moveable.
"
"Why, what's a moveable?
"
"A join'd-stool.
"
"Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.
"
"Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
"
"Women are made to bear, and so are you.
"
"No such jade as you, if me you mean.
"
"Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee!
[p]For, knowing thee to be but young and light-
"
"Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
[p]And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
"
"Should be! should- buzz!
"
"Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
"
"O, slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
"
"Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
"
"Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
"
"If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
"
"My remedy is then to pluck it out.
"
"Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
"
"Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
[p]In his tail.
"
"In his tongue.
"
"Whose tongue?
"
"Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.
"
"What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
[p]Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
"
"That I'll try.               [She strikes him]
"
"I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
"
"So may you lose your arms.
[p]If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
[p]And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
"
"A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
"
"What is your crest- a coxcomb?
"
"A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
"
"No cock of mine: you crow too like a craven.
"
"Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
"
"It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
"
"Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
"
"There is, there is.
"
"Then show it me.
"
"Had I a glass I would.
"
"What, you mean my face?
"
"Well aim'd of such a young one.
"
"Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
"
"Yet you are wither'd.
"
"'Tis with cares.
"
"I care not.
"
"Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
"
"I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.
"
"No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.
[p]'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
[p]And now I find report a very liar;
[p]For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
[p]But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.
[p]Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
[p]Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
[p]Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
[p]But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;
[p]With gentle conference, soft and affable.
[p]Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
[p]O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
[p]Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
[p]As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
[p]O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
"
"Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
"
"Did ever Dian so become a grove
[p]As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
[p]O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
[p]And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!
"
"Where did you study all this goodly speech?
"
"It is extempore, from my mother wit.
"
"A witty mother! witless else her son.
"
"Am I not wise?
"
"Yes, keep you warm.
"
"Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
[p]And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
[p]Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
[p]That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;
[p]And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
[p]Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
[p]For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
[p]Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
[p]Thou must be married to no man but me;
[p]For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
[p]And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
[p]Conformable as other household Kates.
[p][Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO]
[p]Here comes your father. Never make denial;
[p]I must and will have Katherine to my wife.
"
"Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
"
"How but well, sir? how but well?
[p]It were impossible I should speed amiss.
"
"Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?
"
"Call you me daughter? Now I promise you
[p]You have show'd a tender fatherly regard
[p]To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
[p]A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
[p]That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
"
"Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world
[p]That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.
[p]If she be curst, it is for policy,
[p]For,she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
[p]She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
[p]For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
[p]And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.
[p]And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together
[p]That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
"
"I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
"
"Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd first.
"
"Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!
"
"Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;
[p]If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
[p]'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
[p]That she shall still be curst in company.
[p]I tell you 'tis incredible to believe.
[p]How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!
[p]She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
[p]She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
[p]That in a twink she won me to her love.
[p]O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see,
[p]How tame, when men and women are alone,
[p]A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
[p]Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,
[p]To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
[p]Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
[p]I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
"
"I know not what to say; but give me your hands.
[p]God send you joy, Petruchio! 'Tis a match.
"
"[with TRANIO:] Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.
"
"Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
[p]I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
[p]We will have rings and things, and fine array;
[p]And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.
"
"Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
"
"Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
[p]And venture madly on a desperate mart.
"
"'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;
[p]'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
"
"The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
"
"No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
[p]But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:
[p]Now is the day we long have looked for;
[p]I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
"
"And I am one that love Bianca more
[p]Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
"
"Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
"
"Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.
"
"But thine doth fry.
[p]Skipper, stand back; 'tis age that nourisheth.
"
"But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
"
"Content you, gentlemen; I will compound this strife.
[p]'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
[p]That can assure my daughter greatest dower
[p]Shall have my Bianca's love.
[p]Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
"
"First, as you know, my house within the city
[p]Is richly furnished with plate and gold,
[p]Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
[p]My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
[p]In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
[p]In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
[p]Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
[p]Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
[p]Valance of Venice gold in needle-work;
[p]Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs
[p]To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm
[p]I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
[p]Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
[p]And all things answerable to this portion.
[p]Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
[p]And if I die to-morrow this is hers,
[p]If whilst I live she will be only mine.
"
"That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
[p]I am my father's heir and only son;
[p]If I may have your daughter to my wife,
[p]I'll leave her houses three or four as good
[p]Within rich Pisa's walls as any one
[p]Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
[p]Besides two thousand ducats by the year
[p]Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
[p]What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
"
"Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
[p][Aside]  My land amounts not to so much in all.-
[p]That she shall have, besides an argosy
[p]That now is lying in Marseilles road.
[p]What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?
"
"Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
[p]Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
[p]And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,
[p]And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next.
"
"Nay, I have off'red all; I have no more;
[p]And she can have no more than all I have;
[p]If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
"
"Why, then the maid is mine from all the world
[p]By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.
"
"I must confess your offer is the best;
[p]And let your father make her the assurance,
[p]She is your own. Else, you must pardon me;
[p]If you should die before him, where's her dower?
"
"That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.
"
"And may not young men die as well as old?
"
"Well, gentlemen,
[p]I am thus resolv'd: on Sunday next you know
[p]My daughter Katherine is to be married;
[p]Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca
[p]Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
[p]If not, to Signior Gremio.
[p]And so I take my leave, and thank you both.
"
"Adieu, good neighbour.              Exit BAPTISTA
[p]Now, I fear thee not.
[p]Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
[p]To give thee all, and in his waning age
[p]Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
[p]An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.         Exit
"
"A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
[p]Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.
[p]'Tis in my head to do my master good:
[p]I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio
[p]Must get a father, call'd suppos'd Vincentio;
[p]And that's a wonder- fathers commonly
[p]Do get their children; but in this case of wooing
[p]A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
"
"Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir.
[p]Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
[p]Her sister Katherine welcome'd you withal?
"
"But, wrangling pedant, this is
[p]The patroness of heavenly harmony.
[p]Then give me leave to have prerogative;
[p]And when in music we have spent an hour,
[p]Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
"
"Preposterous ass, that never read so far
[p]To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
[p]Was it not to refresh the mind of man
[p]After his studies or his usual pain?
[p]Then give me leave to read philosophy,
[p]And while I pause serve in your harmony.
"
"Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
"
"Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
[p]To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
[p]I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
[p]I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
[p]But learn my lessons as I please myself.
[p]And to cut off all strife: here sit we down;
[p]Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
[p]His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd.
"
"You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
"
"That will be never- tune your instrument.
"
"Where left we last?
"
"Here, madam:
[p]'Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,
[p]Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
"
"Construe them.
"
"'Hic ibat' as I told you before- 'Simois' I am Lucentio-
[p]'hic est' son unto Vincentio of Pisa- 'Sigeia tellus' disguised
[p]thus to get your love- 'Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that
[p]comes a-wooing- 'Priami' is my man Tranio- 'regia' bearing my
[p]port- 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon.
"
"Madam, my instrument's in tune.
"
"Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
"
"Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
"
"Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat Simois' I
[p]know you not- 'hic est Sigeia tellus' I trust you not- 'Hic
[p]steterat Priami' take heed he hear us not- 'regia' presume not-
[p]'celsa senis' despair not.
"
"Madam, 'tis now in tune.
"
"All but the bass.
"
"The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
[p][Aside]  How fiery and forward our pedant is!
[p]Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
[p]Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
"
"In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
"
"Mistrust it not- for sure, AEacides
[p]Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
"
"I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
[p]I should be arguing still upon that doubt;
[p]But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.
[p]Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,
[p]That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
"
"[To LUCENTIO]  You may go walk and give me leave
[p]  awhile;
[p]My lessons make no music in three Parts.
"
"Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,
[p][Aside]  And watch withal; for, but I be deceiv'd,
[p]Our fine musician groweth amorous.
"
"Madam, before you touch the instrument
[p]To learn the order of my fingering,
[p]I must begin with rudiments of art,
[p]To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
[p]More pleasant, pithy, and effectual,
[p]Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
[p]And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
"
"Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
"
"Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
"
"[Reads]
[p]     '""Gamut"" I am, the ground of all accord-
[p]     ""A re"" to plead Hortensio's passion-
[p]     ""B mi"" Bianca, take him for thy lord-
[p]     ""C fa ut"" that loves with all affection-
[p]     ""D sol re"" one clef, two notes have I-
[p]     ""E la mi"" show pity or I die.'
[p]Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not!
[p]Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice
[p]To change true rules for odd inventions.
"
"Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
[p]And help to dress your sister's chamber up.
[p]You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
"
"Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone.
"
"Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
"
"But I have cause to pry into this pedant;
[p]Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
[p]Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
[p]To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale-
[p]Seize thee that list. If once I find thee ranging,
[p]Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.        Exit
"
"[To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day
[p]That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,
[p]And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
[p]What will be said? What mockery will it be
[p]To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
[p]To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
[p]What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
"
"No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc'd
[p]To give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,
[p]Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,
[p]Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
[p]I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
[p]Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
[p]And, to be noted for a merry man,
[p]He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
[p]Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns;
[p]Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
[p]Now must the world point at poor Katherine,
[p]And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
[p]If it would please him come and marry her!'
"
"Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
[p]Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
[p]Whatever fortune stays him from his word.
[p]Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
[p]Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
"
"Would Katherine had never seen him though!
"
"Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,
[p]For such an injury would vex a very saint;
[p]Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
[p][Enter BIONDELLO]
[p]Master, master! News, and such old news as you never heard of!
"
"Is it new and old too? How may that be?
"
"Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?
"
"Is he come?
"
"Why, no, sir.
"
"What then?
"
"He is coming.
"
"When will he be here?
"
"When he stands where I am and sees you there.
"
"But, say, what to thine old news?
"
"Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old
[p]jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd; a pair of boots
[p]that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac'd; an old
[p]rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt,
[p]and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp'd, with an
[p]old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possess'd
[p]with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with
[p]the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped
[p]with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives,
[p]stark spoil'd with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, sway'd in
[p]the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legg'd before, and with a
[p]half-cheek'd bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather which,
[p]being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often
[p]burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times piec'd,
[p]and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her
[p]name fairly set down in studs, and here and there piec'd with
[p]pack-thread.
"
"Who comes with him?
"
"O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd like
[p]the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose
[p]on the other, gart'red with a red and blue list; an old hat, and
[p]the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather; a
[p]monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
[p]footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
"
"'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
[p]Yet oftentimes lie goes but mean-apparell'd.
"
"I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
"
"Why, sir, he comes not.
"
"Didst thou not say he comes?
"
"Who? that Petruchio came?
"
"Ay, that Petruchio came.
"
"No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.
"
"Why, that's all one.
"
"Nay, by Saint Jamy,
[p]         I hold you a penny,
[p]         A horse and a man
[p]         Is more than one,
[p]         And yet not many.
"
"Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?
"
"You are welcome, sir.
"
"And yet I come not well.
"
"And yet you halt not.
"
"Not so well apparell'd
[p]As I wish you were.
"
"Were it better, I should rush in thus.
[p]But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
[p]How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown;
[p]And wherefore gaze this goodly company
[p]As if they saw some wondrous monument,
[p]Some comet or unusual prodigy?
"
"Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day.
[p]First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
[p]Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
[p]Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
[p]An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
"
"And tell us what occasion of import
[p]Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
[p]And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
"
"Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear;
[p]Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
[p]Though in some part enforced to digress,
[p]Which at more leisure I will so excuse
[p]As you shall well be satisfied withal.
[p]But where is Kate? I stay too long from her;
[p]The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
"
"See not your bride in these unreverent robes;
[p]Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
"
"Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
"
"But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
"
"Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words;
[p]To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
[p]Could I repair what she will wear in me
[p]As I can change these poor accoutrements,
[p]'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
[p]But what a fool am I to chat with you,
[p]When I should bid good-morrow to my bride
[p]And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
"
"He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
[p]We will persuade him, be it possible,
[p]To put on better ere he go to church.
"
"I'll after him and see the event of this.
"
"But to her love concerneth us to add
[p]Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
[p]As I before imparted to your worship,
[p]I am to get a man- whate'er he be
[p]It skills not much; we'll fit him to our turn-
[p]And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
[p]And make assurance here in Padua
[p]Of greater sums than I have promised.
[p]So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
[p]And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
"
"Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
[p]Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
[p]'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
[p]Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
[p]I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.
"
"That by degrees we mean to look into
[p]And watch our vantage in this business;
[p]We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
[p]The narrow-prying father, Minola,
[p]The quaint musician, amorous Licio-
[p]All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
[p][Re-enter GREMIO]
[p]Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
"
"As willingly as e'er I came from school.
"
"And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
"
"A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,
[p]A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
"
"Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
"
"Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
"
"Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
"
"Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him!
[p]I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
[p]Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,
[p]'Ay, by gogs-wouns' quoth he, and swore so loud
[p]That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
[p]And as he stoop'd again to take it up,
[p]This mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
[p]That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.
[p]'Now take them up,' quoth he 'if any list.'
"
"What said the wench, when he rose again?
"
"Trembled and shook, for why he stamp'd and swore
[p]As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
[p]But after many ceremonies done
[p]He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
[p]He had been abroad, carousing to his mates
[p]After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
[p]And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
[p]Having no other reason
[p]But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
[p]And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
[p]This done, he took the bride about the neck,
[p]And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
[p]That at the parting all the church did echo.
[p]And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
[p]And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
[p]Such a mad marriage never was before.
[p]Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.    [Music plays]
[p]   Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO, GRUMIO, and train
"
"Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.
[p]I know you think to dine with me to-day,
[p]And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer
[p]But so it is- my haste doth call me hence,
[p]And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
"
"Is't possible you will away to-night?
"
"I must away to-day before night come.
[p]Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
[p]You would entreat me rather go than stay.
[p]And, honest company, I thank you all
[p]That have beheld me give away myself
[p]To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.
[p]Dine with my father, drink a health to me.
[p]For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
"
"Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
"
"It may not be.
"
"Let me entreat you.
"
"It cannot be.
"
"Let me entreat you.
"
"I am content.
"
"Are you content to stay?
"
"I am content you shall entreat me stay;
[p]But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
"
"Now, if you love me, stay.
"
"Grumio, my horse.
"
"Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.
"
"Nay, then,
[p]Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
[p]No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
[p]The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
[p]You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
[p]For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself.
[p]'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
[p]That take it on you at the first so roundly.
"
"O Kate, content thee; prithee be not angry.
"
"I will be angry; what hast thou to do?
[p]Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
"
"Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
"
"Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.
[p]I see a woman may be made a fool
[p]If she had not a spirit to resist.
"
"They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
[p]Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
[p]Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
[p]Carouse full measure to her maidenhead;
[p]Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.
[p]But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
[p]Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
[p]I will be master of what is mine own-
[p]She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,
[p]My household stuff, my field, my barn,
[p]My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
[p]And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;
[p]I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
[p]That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
[p]Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;
[p]Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
[p]Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate;
[p]I'll buckler thee against a million.
"
"Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
"
"Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
"
"Of all mad matches, never was the like.
"
"Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
"
"That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
"
"I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
"
"Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants
[p]For to supply the places at the table,
[p]You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
[p]Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place;
[p]And let Bianca take her sister's room.
"
"Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
"
"She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
"
"Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all
[p]foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray'd? Was
[p]ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are
[p]coming after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and soon
[p]hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof
[p]of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to
[p]thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for,
[p]considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.
[p]Holla, ho! Curtis!
"
"Who is that calls so coldly?
"
"A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my
[p]shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my
[p]neck. A fire, good Curtis.
"
"Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
"
"O, ay, Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no
[p]water.
"
"Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
"
"She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou know'st
[p]winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tam'd my old
[p]master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.
"
"Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
"
"Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long
[p]am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain
[p]on thee to our mistress, whose hand- she being now at hand- thou
[p]shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot
[p]office?
"
"I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?
"
"A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
[p]therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and
[p]mistress are almost frozen to death.
"
"There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?
"
"Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou wilt.
"
"Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
"
"Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
[p]Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes
[p]strew'd, cobwebs swept, the serving-men in their new fustian,
[p]their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
[p]Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, the carpets
[p]laid, and everything in order?
"
"All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
"
"First know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fall'n
[p]out.
"
"How?
"
"Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a
[p]tale.
"
"Let's ha't, good Grumio.
"
"Lend thine ear.
"
"Here.
"
"There.                             [Striking him]
"
"This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
"
"And therefore 'tis call'd a sensible tale; and this cuff
[p]was but to knock at your car and beseech list'ning. Now I begin:
[p]Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my
[p]mistress-
"
"Both of one horse?
"
"What's that to thee?
"
"Why, a horse.
"
"Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross'd me, thou
[p]shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse;
[p]thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was
[p]bemoil'd, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me
[p]because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to
[p]pluck him off me, how he swore, how she pray'd that never pray'd
[p]before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was
[p]burst, how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy memory,
[p]which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienc'd to
[p]thy grave.
"
"By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
"
"Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find
[p]when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth
[p]Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the
[p]rest; let their heads be sleekly comb'd, their blue coats brush'd
[p]and their garters of an indifferent knit; let them curtsy with
[p]their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my mastcr's
[p]horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?
"
"They are.
"
"Call them forth.
"
"Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master, to countenance my
[p]mistress.
"
"Why, she hath a face of her own.
"
"Who knows not that?
"
"Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.
"
"I call them forth to credit her.
"
"Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
"
"Welcome home, Grumio!
"
"How now, Grumio!
"
"What, Grumio!
"
"Fellow Grumio!
"
"How now, old lad!
"
"Welcome, you!- how now, you!- what, you!- fellow, you!- and
[p]thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all ready,
[p]and all things neat?
"
"All things is ready. How near is our master?
"
"E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not-
[p]Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
"
"Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
[p]To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
[p]Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
"
"Here, here, sir; here, sir.
"
"Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
[p]You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
[p]What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
[p]Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
"
"Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
"
"YOU peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
[p]Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
[p]And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
"
"Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
[p]And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel;
[p]There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
[p]And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing;
[p]There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
[p]The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
[p]Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
"
"Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.
[p][Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN]
[p][Sings]  Where is the life that late I led?
[p]         Where are those-
[p]Sit down, Kate, and welcome. Soud, soud, soud, soud!
[p][Re-enter SERVANTS with supper]
[p]Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
[p]Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
[p][Sings]  It was the friar of orders grey,
[p]         As he forth walked on his way-
[p]Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry;
[p]Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
[p][Strikes him]
[p]Be merry, Kate. Some water, here, what, ho!
[p][Enter one with water]
[p]Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
[p]And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
[p][Exit SERVINGMAN]
[p]One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.
[p]Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
[p]Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
[p]You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?    [Strikes him]
"
"Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
"
"A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
[p]Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
[p]Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?
[p]What's this? Mutton?
"
"Ay.
"
"Who brought it?
"
"I.
"
"'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
[p]What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?
[p]How durst you villains bring it from the dresser
[p]And serve it thus to me that love it not?
[p]There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
[p][Throws the meat, etc., at them]
[p]You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
[p]What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
"
"I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet;
[p]The meat was well, if you were so contented.
"
"I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,
[p]And I expressly am forbid to touch it;
[p]For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
[p]And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
[p]Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
[p]Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
[p]Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended.
[p]And for this night we'll fast for company.
[p]Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.   Exeunt
"
"Peter, didst ever see the like?
"
"He kills her in her own humour.
"
"Where is he?
"
"In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,
[p]And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
[p]Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
[p]And sits as one new risen from a dream.
[p]Away, away! for he is coming hither.             Exeunt
"
"Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
[p]And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
[p]My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.
[p]And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,
[p]For then she never looks upon her lure.
[p]Another way I have to man my haggard,
[p]To make her come, and know her keeper's call,
[p]That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
[p]That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.
[p]She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
[p]Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
[p]As with the meat, some undeserved fault
[p]I'll find about the making of the bed;
[p]And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
[p]This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;
[p]Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
[p]That all is done in reverend care of her-
[p]And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night;
[p]And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
[p]And with the clamour keep her still awake.
[p]This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,
[p]And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
[p]He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
[p]Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show.           Exit
"
"Is 't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
[p]Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
[p]I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
"
"Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
[p]Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
"
"Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
"
"What, master, read you, First resolve me that.
"
"I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.'
"
"And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
"
"While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.
"
"Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
[p]You that durst swear that your Mistress Bianca
[p]Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio.
"
"O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
[p]I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
"
"Mistake no more; I am not Licio.
[p]Nor a musician as I seem to be;
[p]But one that scorn to live in this disguise
[p]For such a one as leaves a gentleman
[p]And makes a god of such a cullion.
[p]Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
"
"Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
[p]Of your entire affection to Bianca;
[p]And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
[p]I will with you, if you be so contented,
[p]Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
"
"See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
[p]Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
[p]Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,
[p]As one unworthy all the former favours
[p]That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
"
"And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
[p]Never to marry with her though she would entreat;
[p]Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!
"
"Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
[p]For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
[p]I will be married to a wealtlly widow
[p]Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
[p]As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.
[p]And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
[p]Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
[p]Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
[p]In resolution as I swore before.                   Exit
"
"Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
[p]As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
[p]Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
[p]And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
"
"Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?
"
"Mistress, we have.
"
"Then we are rid of Licio.
"
"I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
[p]That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day.
"
"God give him joy!
"
"Ay, and he'll tame her.
"
"He says so, Tranio.
"
"Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
"
"The taming-school! What, is there such a place?
"
"Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,
[p]That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
[p]To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
"
"O master, master I have watch'd so long
[p]That I am dog-weary; but at last I spied
[p]An ancient angel coming down the hill
[p]Will serve the turn.
"
"What is he, Biondello?
"
"Master, a mercatante or a pedant,
[p]I know not what; but formal in apparel,
[p]In gait and countenance surely like a father.
"
"And what of him, Tranio?
"
"If he be credulous and trust my tale,
[p]I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
[p]And give assurance to Baptista Minola
[p]As if he were the right Vincentio.
[p]Take in your love, and then let me alone.
"
"God save you, sir!
"
"And you, sir; you are welcome.
[p]Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
"
"Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;
[p]But then up farther, and as far as Rome;
[p]And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
"
"What countryman, I pray?
"
"Of Mantua.
"
"Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
[p]And come to Padua, careless of your life!
"
"My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.
"
"'Tis death for any one in Mantua
[p]To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
[p]Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the Duke,
[p]For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,
[p]Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.
[p]'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
[p]You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
"
"Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so!
[p]For I have bills for money by exchange
[p]From Florence, and must here deliver them.
"
"Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
[p]This will I do, and this I will advise you-
[p]First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
"
"Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
[p]Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
"
"Among them know you one Vincentio?
"
"I know him not, but I have heard of him,
[p]A merchant of incomparable wealth.
"
"He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
[p]In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you.
"
"[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all
[p]one.
"
"To save your life in this extremity,
[p]This favour will I do you for his sake;
[p]And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
[p]That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
[p]His name and credit shall you undertake,
[p]And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd;
[p]Look that you take upon you as you should.
[p]You understand me, sir. So shall you stay
[p]Till you have done your business in the city.
[p]If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it.
"
"O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
[p]The patron of my life and liberty.
"
"Then go with me to make the matter good.
[p]This, by the way, I let you understand:
[p]My father is here look'd for every day
[p]To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage
[p]'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
[p]In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.
[p]Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.         Exeunt
"
"No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
"
"The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
[p]What, did he marry me to famish me?
[p]Beggars that come unto my father's door
[p]Upon entreaty have a present alms;
[p]If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
[p]But I, who never knew how to entreat,
[p]Nor never needed that I should entreat,
[p]Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
[p]With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;
[p]And that which spites me more than all these wants-
[p]He does it under name of perfect love;
[p]As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
[p]'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
[p]I prithee go and get me some repast;
[p]I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
"
"What say you to a neat's foot?
"
"'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.
"
"I fear it is too choleric a meat.
[p]How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
"
"I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.
"
"I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
[p]What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
"
"A dish that I do love to feed upon.
"
"Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
"
"Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.
"
"Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,
[p]Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
"
"Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
"
"Why then the mustard without the beef.
"
"Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
[p][Beats him]
[p]That feed'st me with the very name of meat.
[p]Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
[p]That triumph thus upon my misery!
[p]Go, get thee gone, I say.
"
"How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
"
"Mistress, what cheer?
"
"Faith, as cold as can be.
"
"Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.
[p]Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
[p]To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee.
[p]I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
[p]What, not a word? Nay, then thou lov'st it not,
[p]And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
[p]Here, take away this dish.
"
"I pray you, let it stand.
"
"The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
[p]And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
"
"I thank you, sir.
"
"Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
[p]Come, Mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
"
"[Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.-
[p]Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
[p]Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
[p]Will we return unto thy father's house
[p]And revel it as bravely as the best,
[p]With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,
[p]With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,
[p]With scarfs and fans and double change of brav'ry.
[p]With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.
[p]What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,
[p]To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
[p][Enter TAILOR]
[p]Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
[p]Lay forth the gown.
[p][Enter HABERDASHER]
[p]What news with you, sir?
"
"Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
"
"Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
[p]A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
[p]Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
[p]A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
[p]Away with it. Come, let me have a bigger.
"
"I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
[p]And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
"
"When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
[p]And not till then.
"
"[Aside]  That will not be in haste.
"
"Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
[p]And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.
[p]Your betters have endur'd me say my mind,
[p]And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
[p]My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
[p]Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
[p]And rather than it shall, I will be free
[p]Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
"
"Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
[p]A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
[p]I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not.
"
"Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
[p]And it I will have, or I will have none. Exit HABERDASHER
"
"Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see't.
[p]O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
[p]What's this? A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon.
[p]What, up and down, carv'd like an appletart?
[p]Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
[p]Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
[p]Why, what a devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
"
"[Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
"
"You bid me make it orderly and well,
[p]According to the fashion and the time.
"
"Marry, and did; but if you be rememb'red,
[p]I did not bid you mar it to the time.
[p]Go, hop me over every kennel home,
[p]For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
[p]I'll none of it; hence! make your best of it.
"
"I never saw a better fashion'd gown,
[p]More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;
[p]Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
"
"Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
"
"She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.
"
"O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou
[p]  thimble,
[p]Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,
[p]Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou-
[p]Brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!
[p]Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
[p]Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard
[p]As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st!
[p]I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
"
"Your worship is deceiv'd; the gown is made
[p]Just as my master had direction.
[p]Grumio gave order how it should be done.
"
"I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
"
"But how did you desire it should be made?
"
"Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
"
"But did you not request to have it cut?
"
"Thou hast fac'd many things.
"
"I have.
"
"Face not me. Thou hast brav'd many men; brave not me. I
[p]will neither be fac'd nor brav'd. I say unto thee, I bid thy
[p]master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to pieces.
[p]Ergo, thou liest.
"
"Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
"
"Read it.
"
"The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
"
"[Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-
"
"Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the
[p]skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread; I
[p]said a gown.
"
"Proceed.
"
"[Reads]  'With a small compass'd cape'-
"
"I confess the cape.
"
"[Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve'-
"
"I confess two sleeves.
"
"[Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
"
"Ay, there's the villainy.
"
"Error i' th' bill, sir; error i' th' bill! I commanded the
[p]sleeves should be cut out, and sew'd up again; and that I'll
[p]prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
"
"This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where, thou
[p]shouldst know it.
"
"I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy
[p]meteyard, and spare not me.
"
"God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.
"
"Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
"
"You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.
"
"Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
"
"Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress' gown for
[p]thy master's use!
"
"Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
"
"O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.
[p]Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
[p]O fie, fie, fie!
"
"[Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.-
[p]Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
"
"Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow;
[p]Take no unkindness of his hasty words.
[p]Away, I say; commend me to thy master.      Exit TAILOR
"
"Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
[p]Even in these honest mean habiliments;
[p]Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
[p]For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
[p]And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
[p]So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
[p]What, is the jay more precious than the lark
[p]Because his feathers are more beautiful?
[p]Or is the adder better than the eel
[p]Because his painted skin contents the eye?
[p]O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
[p]For this poor furniture and mean array.
[p]If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;
[p]And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
[p]To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
[p]Go call my men, and let us straight to him;
[p]And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
[p]There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
[p]Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
[p]And well we may come there by dinner-time.
"
"I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,
[p]And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
"
"It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
[p]Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
[p]You are still crossing it. Sirs, let 't alone;
[p]I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
[p]It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
"
"Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
"
"Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?
"
"Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,
[p]Signior Baptista may remember me
[p]Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
[p]Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
"
"'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
[p]With such austerity as longeth to a father.
"
"I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
[p]'Twere good he were school'd.
"
"Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
[p]Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
[p]Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
"
"Tut, fear not me.
"
"But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
"
"I told him that your father was at Venice,
[p]And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
"
"Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
[p]Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
[p][Enter BAPTISTA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO]
[p]Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
[p][To To the PEDANT] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of;
[p]I pray you stand good father to me now;
[p]Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
"
"Soft, son!
[p]Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
[p]To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
[p]Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
[p]Of love between your daughter and himself;
[p]And- for the good report I hear of you,
[p]And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
[p]And she to him- to stay him not too long,
[p]I am content, in a good father's care,
[p]To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
[p]No worse than I, upon some agreement
[p]Me shall you find ready and willing
[p]With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
[p]For curious I cannot be with you,
[p]Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
"
"Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
[p]Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
[p]Right true it is your son Lucentio here
[p]Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
[p]Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
[p]And therefore, if you say no more than this,
[p]That like a father you will deal with him,
[p]And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
[p]The match is made, and all is done-
[p]Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
"
"I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
[p]We be affied, and such assurance ta'en
[p]As shall with either part's agreement stand?
"
"Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
[p]Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;
[p]Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,
[p]And happily we might be interrupted.
"
"Then at my lodging, an it like you.
[p]There doth my father lie; and there this night
[p]We'll pass the business privately and well.
[p]Send for your daughter by your servant here;
[p]My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
[p]The worst is this, that at so slender warning
[p]You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
"
"It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
[p]And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
[p]And, if you will, tell what hath happened-
[p]Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,
[p]And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife. Exit LUCENTIO
"
"I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
"
"Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
[p][Exit BIONDELLO]
[p]Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
[p]Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer;
[p]Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
"
"I follow you.                            Exeunt
"
"Cambio.
"
"What say'st thou, Biondello?
"
"You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
"
"Biondello, what of that?
"
"Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound
[p]the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
"
"I pray thee moralize them.
"
"Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving
[p]father of a deceitful son.
"
"And what of him?
"
"His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
"
"And then?
"
"The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command
[p]at all hours.
"
"And what of all this?
"
"I cannot tell, except they are busied about a
[p]counterfeit assurance. Take your assurance of her, cum privilegio
[p]ad imprimendum solum; to th' church take the priest, clerk, and
[p]some sufficient honest witnesses.
[p]If this be not that you look for, I have more to say,
[p]But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.
"
"Hear'st thou, Biondello?
"
"I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an afternoon
[p]as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so
[p]may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to
[p]go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you
[p]come with your appendix.
"
"I may and will, if she be so contented.
[p]She will be pleas'd; then wherefore should I doubt?
[p]Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her;
[p]It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.         Exit
"
"Come on, a God's name; once more toward our father's.
[p]Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
"
"The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.
"
"I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
"
"I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
"
"Now by my mother's son, and that's myself,
[p]It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
[p]Or ere I journey to your father's house.
[p]Go on and fetch our horses back again.
[p]Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
"
"Say as he says, or we shall never go.
"
"Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
[p]And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;
[p]And if you please to call it a rush-candle,
[p]Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
"
"I say it is the moon.
"
"I know it is the moon.
"
"Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.
"
"Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun;
[p]But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
[p]And the moon changes even as your mind.
[p]What you will have it nam'd, even that it is,
[p]And so it shall be so for Katherine.

"Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.
"
"Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,

[p]But, soft! Company is coming here.
[p][Enter VINCENTIO]
[p][To VINCENTIO]  Good-morrow, gentle mistress; where away?-
[p]Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
[p]Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
[p]Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
[p]What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
[p]As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
[p]Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
[p]Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
"
"'A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
"
"Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
[p]Whither away, or where is thy abode?
[p]Happy the parents of so fair a child;
[p]Happier the man whom favourable stars
[p]Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.
"
"Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad!
[p]This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,
[p]And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
"
"Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
[p]That have been so bedazzled with the sun
[p]That everything I look on seemeth green;
[p]Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.
[p]Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
"
"Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
[p]Which way thou travellest- if along with us,
[p]We shall be joyful of thy company.
"
"Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
[p]That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,
[p]My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
[p]And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
[p]A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
"
"What is his name?
"
"Lucentio, gentle sir.
"
"Happily met; the happier for thy son.
[p]And now by law, as well as reverend age,
[p]I may entitle thee my loving father:
[p]The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
[p]Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
[p]Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
[p]Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
[p]Beside, so qualified as may beseem
[p]The spouse of any noble gentleman.
[p]Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
[p]And wander we to see thy honest son,
[p]Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
"
"But is this true; or is it else your pleasure,
[p]Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
[p]Upon the company you overtake?
"
"I do assure thee, father, so it is.
"
"Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
[p]For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
"
"Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
[p]Have to my widow; and if she be froward,
[p]Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.    Exit
"
"Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
"
"I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need the at
[p]home, therefore leave us.
"
"Nay, faith, I'll see the church a your back, and then
[p]come back to my master's as soon as I can.
"
"I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
"
"Sir, here's the door; this is Lucentio's house;
[p]My father's bears more toward the market-place;
[p]Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
"
"You shall not choose but drink before you go;
[p]I think I shall command your welcome here,
[p]And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.    [Knocks]
"
"They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
"
"What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
"
"Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
"
"He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
"
"What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make
[p]merry withal?
"
"Keep your hundred pounds to yourself; he shall need none so
[p]long as I live.
"
"Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do
[p]you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell
[p]Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here
[p]at the door to speak with him.
"
"Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking
[p]out at the window.
"
"Art thou his father?
"
"Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
"
"[To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman!
[p]Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's name.
"
"Lay hands on the villain; I believe 'a means to cozen
[p]somebody in this city under my countenance.
"
"I have seen them in the church together. God send 'em
[p]good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master, Vincentio! Now we
[p]are undone and brought to nothing.
"
"[Seeing BIONDELLO]  Come hither, crack-hemp.
"
"I hope I may choose, sir.
"
"Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
"
"Forgot you! No, sir. I could not forget you, for I never
[p]saw you before in all my life.
"
"What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy
[p]master's father, Vincentio?
"
"What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir; see
[p]where he looks out of the window.
"
"Is't so, indeed?               [He beats BIONDELLO]
"
"Help, help, help! Here's a madman will murder me.
"
"Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!     Exit from above
"
"Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of this
[p]controversy.                         [They stand aside]
[p]   Re-enter PEDANT below; BAPTISTA, TRANIO, and SERVANTS
"
"Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
"
"What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods!
[p]O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak,
[p]and a copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! While I play the
[p]good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the
[p]university.
"
"How now! what's the matter?
"
"What, is the man lunatic?
"
"Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but
[p]your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I
[p]wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to
[p]maintain it.
"
"Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
"
"You mistake, sir; you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you
[p]think is his name?
"
"His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him
[p]up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
"
"Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is mine
[p]only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vicentio.
"
"Lucentio! O, he hath murd'red his master! Lay hold on
[p]him, I charge you, in the Duke's name. O, my son, my son! Tell
[p]me, thou villain, where is my son, Lucentio?
"
"Call forth an officer.
[p][Enter one with an OFFICER]
[p]Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge you
[p]see that he be forthcoming.
"
"Carry me to the gaol!
"
"Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.
"
"Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to prison.
"
"Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catch'd in
[p]this business; I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.
"
"Swear if thou dar'st.
"
"Nay, I dare not swear it.
"
"Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
"
"Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
"
"Away with the dotard; to the gaol with him!
"
"Thus strangers may be hal'd and abus'd. O monstrous
[p]villain!
"
"O, we are spoil'd; and yonder he is! Deny him, forswear
[p]him, or else we are all undone.
"
"[Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.
"
"Lives my sweet son?
"
"Pardon, dear father.
"
"How hast thou offended?
[p]Where is Lucentio?
"
"Here's Lucentio,
[p]Right son to the right Vincentio,
[p]That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
[p]While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne.
"
"Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
"
"Where is that damned villain, Tranio,
[p]That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so?
"
"Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
"
"Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.
"
"Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
[p]Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
[p]While he did bear my countenance in the town;
[p]And happily I have arrived at the last
[p]Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
[p]What Tranio did, myself enforc'd him to;
[p]Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
"
"I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to
[p]the gaol.
"
"[To LUCENTIO]  But do you hear, sir? Have you married my
[p]daughter without asking my good will?
"
"Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but I
[p]will in to be revenged for this villainy.          Exit
"
"And I to sound the depth of this knavery.  Exit
"
"Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
"
"My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest;
[p]Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.      Exit
"
"Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.
"
"First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
"
"What, in the midst of the street?
"
"What, art thou asham'd of me?
"
"No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
"
"Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
"
"Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love, stay.
"
"Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
[p]Better once than never, for never too late.      Exeunt
"
"At last, though long, our jarring notes agree;
[p]And time it is when raging war is done
[p]To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
[p]My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
[p]While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
[p]Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,
[p]And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
[p]Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.
[p]My banquet is to close our stomachs up
[p]After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
[p]For now we sit to chat as well as eat.       [They sit]
"
"Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
"
"Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
"
"Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
"
"For both our sakes I would that word were true.
"
"Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
"
"Then never trust me if I be afeard.
"
"YOU are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
[p]I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.
"
"He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
"
"Roundly replied.
"
"Mistress, how mean you that?
"
"Thus I conceive by him.
"
"Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
"
"My widow says thus she conceives her tale.
"
"Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
"
"'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.'
[p]I pray you tell me what you meant by that.
"
"Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
[p]Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe;
[p]And now you know my meaning.
"
"A very mean meaning.
"
"Right, I mean you.
"
"And I am mean, indeed, respecting you.
"
"To her, Kate!
"
"To her, widow!
"
"A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
"
"That's my office.
"
"Spoke like an officer- ha' to thee, lad.
"
"How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
"
"Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
"
"Head and butt! An hasty-witted body
[p]Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
"
"Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
"
"Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
"
"Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,
[p]Have at you for a bitter jest or two.
"
"Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
[p]And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
[p]You are welcome all.
"
"She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,
[p]This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
[p]Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
"
"O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
[p]Which runs himself, and catches for his master.
"
"A good swift simile, but something currish.
"
"'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;
[p]'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
"
"O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
"
"I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
"
"Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?
"
"'A has a little gall'd me, I confess;
[p]And, as the jest did glance away from me,
[p]'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
"
"Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
[p]I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
"
"Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,
[p]Let's each one send unto his wife,
[p]And he whose wife is most obedient,
[p]To come at first when he doth send for her,
[p]Shall win the wager which we will propose.
"
"Content. What's the wager?
"
"Twenty crowns.
"
"Twenty crowns?
[p]I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
[p]But twenty times so much upon my wife.
"
"A hundred then.
"
"Content.
"
"A match! 'tis done.
"
"Who shall begin?
"
"That will I.
[p]Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
"
"I go.                                     Exit
"
"Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.
"
"I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
[p][Re-enter BIONDELLO]
[p]How now! what news?
"
"Sir, my mistress sends you word
[p]That she is busy and she cannot come.
"
"How! She's busy, and she cannot come!
[p]Is that an answer?
"
"Ay, and a kind one too.
[p]Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
"
"I hope better.
"
"Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
[p]To come to me forthwith.                 Exit BIONDELLO
"
"O, ho! entreat her!
[p]Nay, then she must needs come.
"
"I am afraid, sir,
[p]Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
[p][Re-enter BIONDELLO]
[p]Now, where's my wife?
"
"She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
[p]She will not come; she bids you come to her.
"
"Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
[p]Intolerable, not to be endur'd!
[p]Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
[p]Say I command her come to me.               Exit GRUMIO
"
"I know her answer.
"
"What?
"
"She will not.
"
"The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
"
"Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!
"
"What is your sir, that you send for me?
"
"Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
"
"They sit conferring by the parlour fire.
"
"Go, fetch them hither; if they deny to come.
[p]Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
[p]Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
"
"Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
"
"And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.
"
"Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
[p]An awful rule, and right supremacy;
[p]And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy.
"
"Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
[p]The wager thou hast won; and I will add
[p]Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
[p]Another dowry to another daughter,
[p]For she is chang'd, as she had never been.
"
"Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
[p]And show more sign of her obedience,
[p]Her new-built virtue and obedience.
[p][Re-enter KATHERINA with BIANCA and WIDOW]
[p]See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
[p]As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
[p]Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:
[p]Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
"
"Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
[p]Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
"
"Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
"
"I would your duty were as foolish too;
[p]The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
[p]Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!
"
"The more fool you for laying on my duty.
"
"Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
[p]What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
"
"Come, come, you're mocking; we will have no telling.
"
"Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
"
"She shall not.
"
"I say she shall. And first begin with her.
"
"Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
[p]And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
[p]To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.
[p]It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
[p]Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
[p]And in no sense is meet or amiable.
[p]A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
[p]Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
[p]And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
[p]Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
[p]Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
[p]Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
[p]And for thy maintenance commits his body
[p]To painful labour both by sea and land,
[p]To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
[p]Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
[p]And craves no other tribute at thy hands
[p]But love, fair looks, and true obedience-
[p]Too little payment for so great a debt.
[p]Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
[p]Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
[p]And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
[p]And not obedient to his honest will,
[p]What is she but a foul contending rebel
[p]And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
[p]I am asham'd that women are so simple
[p]To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
[p]Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
[p]When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
[p]Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
[p]Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
[p]But that our soft conditions and our hearts
[p]Should well agree with our external parts?
[p]Come, come, you forward and unable worms!
[p]My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
[p]My heart as great, my reason haply more,
[p]To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
[p]But now I see our lances are but straws,
[p]Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
[p]That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
[p]Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
[p]And place your hands below your husband's foot;
[p]In token of which duty, if he please,
[p]My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
"
"Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
"
"Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
"
"'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
"
"But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
"
"Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
[p]We three are married, but you two are sped.
[p][To LUCENTIO]  'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
[p]And being a winner, God give you good night!
"
"Now go thy ways; thou hast tam'd a curst shrow.
"
"'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam'd so.
"
"Boatswain!
"
"Here, master: what cheer?
"
"Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
[p]or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
"
"Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
[p]yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
[p]master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
[p]if room enough!
[p][Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND,]
[p]GONZALO, and others]
"
"Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
[p]Play the men.
"
"I pray now, keep below.
"
"Where is the master, boatswain?
"
"Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
[p]cabins: you do assist the storm.
"
"Nay, good, be patient.
"
"When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
[p]for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
"
"Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
"
"None that I more love than myself. You are a
[p]counsellor; if you can command these elements to
[p]silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
[p]not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
[p]cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
[p]yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
[p]the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
[p]of our way, I say.
"
"I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
[p]hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
[p]perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
[p]hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
[p]for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
[p]born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
"
"Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
[p]her to try with main-course.
[p][A cry within]
[p]A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
[p]the weather or our office.
[p][Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO]
[p]Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
[p]and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
"
"A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
[p]incharitable dog!
"
"Work you then.
"
"Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
[p]We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
"
"I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
[p]no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
[p]unstanched wench.
"
"Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
[p]sea again; lay her off.
"
"All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
"
"What, must our mouths be cold?
"
"The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
[p]For our case is as theirs.
"
"I'm out of patience.
"
"We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
[p]This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
[p]The washing of ten tides!
"
"He'll be hang'd yet,
[p]Though every drop of water swear against it
[p]And gape at widest to glut him.
[p][A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'--]
[p]'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and
[p]children!'--
[p]'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!']
"
"Let's all sink with the king.
"
"Let's take leave of him.
"
"Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
[p]acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
[p]thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
[p]die a dry death.
"
"If by your art, my dearest father, you have
[p]Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
[p]The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
[p]But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
[p]Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
[p]With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
[p]Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
[p]Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
[p]Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
[p]Had I been any god of power, I would
[p]Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
[p]It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
[p]The fraughting souls within her.
"
"Be collected:
[p]No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
[p]There's no harm done.
"
"O, woe the day!
"
"No harm.
[p]I have done nothing but in care of thee,
[p]Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
[p]Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
[p]Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
[p]Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
[p]And thy no greater father.
"
"More to know
[p]Did never meddle with my thoughts.
"
"'Tis time
[p]I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
[p]And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
[p][Lays down his mantle]
[p]Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
[p]The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
[p]The very virtue of compassion in thee,
[p]I have with such provision in mine art
[p]So safely ordered that there is no soul--
[p]No, not so much perdition as an hair
[p]Betid to any creature in the vessel
[p]Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
[p]For thou must now know farther.
"
"You have often
[p]Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
[p]And left me to a bootless inquisition,
[p]Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
"
"The hour's now come;
[p]The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
[p]Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
[p]A time before we came unto this cell?
[p]I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
[p]Out three years old.
"
"Certainly, sir, I can.
"
"By what? by any other house or person?
[p]Of any thing the image tell me that
[p]Hath kept with thy remembrance.
"
"'Tis far off
[p]And rather like a dream than an assurance
[p]That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
[p]Four or five women once that tended me?
"
"Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
[p]That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
[p]In the dark backward and abysm of time?
[p]If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
[p]How thou camest here thou mayst.
"
"But that I do not.
"
"Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
[p]Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
[p]A prince of power.
"
"Sir, are not you my father?
"
"Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
[p]She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
[p]Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
[p]And princess no worse issued.
"
"O the heavens!
[p]What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
[p]Or blessed was't we did?
"
"Both, both, my girl:
[p]By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
[p]But blessedly holp hither.
"
"O, my heart bleeds
[p]To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
[p]Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
"
"My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
[p]I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
[p]Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
[p]Of all the world I loved and to him put
[p]The manage of my state; as at that time
[p]Through all the signories it was the first
[p]And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
[p]In dignity, and for the liberal arts
[p]Without a parallel; those being all my study,
[p]The government I cast upon my brother
[p]And to my state grew stranger, being transported
[p]And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
[p]Dost thou attend me?
"
"Sir, most heedfully.
"
"Being once perfected how to grant suits,
[p]How to deny them, who to advance and who
[p]To trash for over-topping, new created
[p]The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
[p]Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
[p]Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
[p]To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
[p]The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
[p]And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
"
"O, good sir, I do.
"
"I pray thee, mark me.
[p]I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
[p]To closeness and the bettering of my mind
[p]With that which, but by being so retired,
[p]O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
[p]Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
[p]Like a good parent, did beget of him
[p]A falsehood in its contrary as great
[p]As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
[p]A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
[p]Not only with what my revenue yielded,
[p]But what my power might else exact, like one
[p]Who having into truth, by telling of it,
[p]Made such a sinner of his memory,
[p]To credit his own lie, he did believe
[p]He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
[p]And executing the outward face of royalty,
[p]With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
[p]Dost thou hear?
"
"Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
"
"To have no screen between this part he play'd
[p]And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
[p]Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
[p]Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
[p]He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
[p]So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
[p]To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
[p]Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
[p]The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
[p]To most ignoble stooping.
"
"O the heavens!
"
"Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
[p]If this might be a brother.
"
"I should sin
[p]To think but nobly of my grandmother:
[p]Good wombs have borne bad sons.
"
"Now the condition.
[p]The King of Naples, being an enemy
[p]To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
[p]Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
[p]Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
[p]Should presently extirpate me and mine
[p]Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
[p]With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
[p]A treacherous army levied, one midnight
[p]Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
[p]The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
[p]The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
[p]Me and thy crying self.
"
"Alack, for pity!
[p]I, not remembering how I cried out then,
[p]Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
[p]That wrings mine eyes to't.
"
"Hear a little further
[p]And then I'll bring thee to the present business
[p]Which now's upon's; without the which this story
[p]Were most impertinent.
"
"Wherefore did they not
[p]That hour destroy us?
"
"Well demanded, wench:
[p]My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
[p]So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
[p]A mark so bloody on the business, but
[p]With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
[p]In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
[p]Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
[p]A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
[p]Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
[p]Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
[p]To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
[p]To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
[p]Did us but loving wrong.
"
"Alack, what trouble
[p]Was I then to you!
"
"O, a cherubim
[p]Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
[p]Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
[p]When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
[p]Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
[p]An undergoing stomach, to bear up
[p]Against what should ensue.
"
"How came we ashore?
"
"By Providence divine.
[p]Some food we had and some fresh water that
[p]A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
[p]Out of his charity, being then appointed
[p]Master of this design, did give us, with
[p]Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
[p]Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
[p]Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
[p]From mine own library with volumes that
[p]I prize above my dukedom.
"
"Would I might
[p]But ever see that man!
"
"Now I arise:
[p][Resumes his mantle]
[p]Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
[p]Here in this island we arrived; and here
[p]Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
[p]Than other princesses can that have more time
[p]For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
"
"Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
[p]For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
[p]For raising this sea-storm?
"
"Know thus far forth.
[p]By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
[p]Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
[p]Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
[p]I find my zenith doth depend upon
[p]A most auspicious star, whose influence
[p]If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
[p]Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
[p]Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
[p]And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
[p][MIRANDA sleeps]
[p]Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
[p]Approach, my Ariel, come.
"
"All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
[p]To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
[p]To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
[p]On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
[p]Ariel and all his quality.
"
"Hast thou, spirit,
[p]Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
"
"To every article.
[p]I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
[p]Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
[p]I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
[p]And burn in many places; on the topmast,
[p]The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
[p]Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
[p]O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
[p]And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
[p]Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
[p]Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
[p]Yea, his dread trident shake.
"
"My brave spirit!
[p]Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
[p]Would not infect his reason?
"
"Not a soul
[p]But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
[p]Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
[p]Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
[p]Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
[p]With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
[p]Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
[p]And all the devils are here.'
"
"Why that's my spirit!
[p]But was not this nigh shore?
"
"Close by, my master.
"
"But are they, Ariel, safe?
"
"Not a hair perish'd;
[p]On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
[p]But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
[p]In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
[p]The king's son have I landed by himself;
[p]Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
[p]In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
[p]His arms in this sad knot.
"
"Of the king's ship
[p]The mariners say how thou hast disposed
[p]And all the rest o' the fleet.
"
"Safely in harbour
[p]Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
[p]Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
[p]From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
[p]The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
[p]Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
[p]I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
[p]Which I dispersed, they all have met again
[p]And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
[p]Bound sadly home for Naples,
[p]Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
[p]And his great person perish.
"
"Ariel, thy charge
[p]Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
[p]What is the time o' the day?
"
"Past the mid season.
"
"At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
[p]Must by us both be spent most preciously.
"
"Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
[p]Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
[p]Which is not yet perform'd me.
"
"How now? moody?
[p]What is't thou canst demand?
"
"My liberty.
"
"Before the time be out? no more!
"
"I prithee,
[p]Remember I have done thee worthy service;
[p]Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
[p]Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
[p]To bate me a full year.
"
"Dost thou forget
[p]From what a torment I did free thee?
"
"No.
"
"Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
[p]Of the salt deep,
[p]To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
[p]To do me business in the veins o' the earth
[p]When it is baked with frost.
"
"I do not, sir.
"
"Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
[p]The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
[p]Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
"
"No, sir.
"
"Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
"
"Sir, in Argier.
"
"O, was she so? I must
[p]Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
[p]Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
[p]For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
[p]To enter human hearing, from Argier,
[p]Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
[p]They would not take her life. Is not this true?
"
"Ay, sir.
"
"This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
[p]And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
[p]As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
[p]And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
[p]To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
[p]Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
[p]By help of her more potent ministers
[p]And in her most unmitigable rage,
[p]Into a cloven pine; within which rift
[p]Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
[p]A dozen years; within which space she died
[p]And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
[p]As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
[p]Save for the son that she did litter here,
[p]A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
[p]A human shape.
"
"Yes, Caliban her son.
"
"Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
[p]Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
[p]What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
[p]Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
[p]Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
[p]To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
[p]Could not again undo: it was mine art,
[p]When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
[p]The pine and let thee out.
"
"I thank thee, master.
"
"If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
[p]And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
[p]Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
"
"Pardon, master;
[p]I will be correspondent to command
[p]And do my spiriting gently.
"
"Do so, and after two days
[p]I will discharge thee.
"
"That's my noble master!
[p]What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?
"
"Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
[p]To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
[p]To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
[p]And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
[p][Exit ARIEL]
[p]Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!
"
"The strangeness of your story put
[p]Heaviness in me.
"
"Shake it off. Come on;
[p]We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
[p]Yields us kind answer.
"
"'Tis a villain, sir,
[p]I do not love to look on.
"
"But, as 'tis,
[p]We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
[p]Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
[p]That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
[p]Thou earth, thou! speak.
"
"[Within] There's wood enough within.
"
"Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
[p]Come, thou tortoise! when?
[p][Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph]
[p]Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
[p]Hark in thine ear.
"
"My lord it shall be done.
"
"Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
[p]Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
"
"As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
[p]With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
[p]Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
[p]And blister you all o'er!
"
"For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
[p]Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
[p]Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
[p]All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
[p]As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
[p]Than bees that made 'em.
"
"I must eat my dinner.
[p]This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
[p]Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
[p]Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
[p]Water with berries in't, and teach me how
[p]To name the bigger light, and how the less,
[p]That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
[p]And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
[p]The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
[p]Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
[p]Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
[p]For I am all the subjects that you have,
[p]Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
[p]In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
[p]The rest o' the island.
"
"Thou most lying slave,
[p]Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
[p]Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
[p]In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
[p]The honour of my child.
"
"O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
[p]Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
[p]This isle with Calibans.
"
"Abhorred slave,
[p]Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
[p]Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
[p]Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
[p]One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
[p]Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
[p]A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
[p]With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
[p]Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
[p]good natures
[p]Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
[p]Deservedly confined into this rock,
[p]Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
"
"You taught me language; and my profit on't
[p]Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
[p]For learning me your language!
"
"Hag-seed, hence!
[p]Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
[p]To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
[p]If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
[p]What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
[p]Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
[p]That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
"
"No, pray thee.
[p][Aside]
[p]I must obey: his art is of such power,
[p]It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
[p]and make a vassal of him.
"
"So, slave; hence!
[p][Exit CALIBAN]
[p][Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing;]
[p]FERDINAND following]
[p]ARIEL'S song.
[p]Come unto these yellow sands,
[p]And then take hands:
[p]Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
[p]The wild waves whist,
[p]Foot it featly here and there;
[p]And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
[p]Hark, hark!
[p][Burthen [dispersedly, within] Bow-wow]
[p]The watch-dogs bark!
[p][Burthen Bow-wow]
[p]Hark, hark! I hear
[p]The strain of strutting chanticleer
[p]Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
"
"Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
[p]It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
[p]Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
[p]Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
[p]This music crept by me upon the waters,
[p]Allaying both their fury and my passion
[p]With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
[p]Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
[p]No, it begins again.
[p][ARIEL sings]
[p]Full fathom five thy father lies;
[p]Of his bones are coral made;
[p]Those are pearls that were his eyes:
[p]Nothing of him that doth fade
[p]But doth suffer a sea-change
[p]Into something rich and strange.
[p]Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
[p][Burthen Ding-dong]
[p]Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.
"
"The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
[p]This is no mortal business, nor no sound
[p]That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
"
"The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
[p]And say what thou seest yond.
"
"What is't? a spirit?
[p]Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
[p]It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
"
"No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
[p]As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
[p]Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
[p]With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
[p]A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
[p]And strays about to find 'em.
"
"I might call him
[p]A thing divine, for nothing natural
[p]I ever saw so noble.
"
"[Aside] It goes on, I see,
[p]As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
[p]Within two days for this.
"
"Most sure, the goddess
[p]On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
[p]May know if you remain upon this island;
[p]And that you will some good instruction give
[p]How I may bear me here: my prime request,
[p]Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
[p]If you be maid or no?
"
"No wonder, sir;
[p]But certainly a maid.
"
"My language! heavens!
[p]I am the best of them that speak this speech,
[p]Were I but where 'tis spoken.
"
"How? the best?
[p]What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
"
"A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
[p]To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
[p]And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
[p]Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
[p]The king my father wreck'd.
"
"Alack, for mercy!
"
"Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
[p]And his brave son being twain.
"
"[Aside]. The Duke of Milan
[p]And his more braver daughter could control thee,
[p]If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
[p]They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
[p]I'll set thee free for this.
[p][To FERDINAND]
[p]A word, good sir;
[p]I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
"
"Why speaks my father so ungently? This
[p]Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
[p]That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
[p]To be inclined my way!
"
"O, if a virgin,
[p]And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
[p]The queen of Naples.
"
"Soft, sir! one word more.
[p][Aside]
[p]They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
[p]I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
[p]Make the prize light.
[p][To FERDINAND]
[p]One word more; I charge thee
[p]That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
[p]The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
[p]Upon this island as a spy, to win it
[p]From me, the lord on't.
"
"No, as I am a man.
"
"There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
[p]If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
[p]Good things will strive to dwell with't.
"
"Follow me.
[p]Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
[p]I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
[p]Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
[p]The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
[p]Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
"
"No;
[p]I will resist such entertainment till
[p]Mine enemy has more power.
"
"O dear father,
[p]Make not too rash a trial of him, for
[p]He's gentle and not fearful.
"
"What? I say,
[p]My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
[p]Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
[p]Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
[p]For I can here disarm thee with this stick
[p]And make thy weapon drop.
"
"Beseech you, father.
"
"Hence! hang not on my garments.
"
"Sir, have pity;
[p]I'll be his surety.
"
"Silence! one word more
[p]Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
[p]An advocate for an imposter! hush!
[p]Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
[p]Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
[p]To the most of men this is a Caliban
[p]And they to him are angels.
"
"My affections
[p]Are then most humble; I have no ambition
[p]To see a goodlier man.
"
"Come on; obey:
[p]Thy nerves are in their infancy again
[p]And have no vigour in them.
"
"So they are;
[p]My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
[p]My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
[p]The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
[p]To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
[p]Might I but through my prison once a day
[p]Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
[p]Let liberty make use of; space enough
[p]Have I in such a prison.
"
"[Aside] It works.
[p][To FERDINAND]
[p]Come on.
[p]Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
[p][To FERDINAND]
[p]Follow me.
[p][To ARIEL]
[p]Hark what thou else shalt do me.
"
"Be of comfort;
[p]My father's of a better nature, sir,
[p]Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
[p]Which now came from him.
"
"Thou shalt be free
[p]As mountain winds: but then exactly do
[p]All points of my command.
"
"To the syllable.
"
"Come, follow. Speak not for him.
"
"Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
[p]So have we all, of joy; for our escape
[p]Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
[p]Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
[p]The masters of some merchant and the merchant
[p]Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
[p]I mean our preservation, few in millions
[p]Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
[p]Our sorrow with our comfort.
"
"Prithee, peace.
"
"He receives comfort like cold porridge.
"
"The visitor will not give him o'er so.
"
"Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
[p]by and by it will strike.
"
"Sir,--
"
"One: tell.
"
"When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
[p]Comes to the entertainer--
"
"A dollar.
"
"Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
[p]have spoken truer than you purposed.
"
"You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
"
"Therefore, my lord,--
"
"Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
"
"I prithee, spare.
"
"Well, I have done: but yet,--
"
"He will be talking.
"
"Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
[p]wager, first begins to crow?
"
"The old cock.
"
"The cockerel.
"
"Done. The wager?
"
"A laughter.
"
"A match!
"
"Though this island seem to be desert,--
"
"Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.
"
"Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
"
"Yet,--
"
"Yet,--
"
"He could not miss't.
"
"It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
[p]temperance.
"
"Temperance was a delicate wench.
"
"Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
"
"The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
"
"As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
"
"Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
"
"Here is everything advantageous to life.
"
"True; save means to live.
"
"Of that there's none, or little.
"
"How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
"
"The ground indeed is tawny.
"
"With an eye of green in't.
"
"He misses not much.
"
"No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
"
"But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
[p]beyond credit,--
"
"As many vouched rarities are.
"
"That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
[p]the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
[p]glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
[p]salt water.
"
"If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
[p]say he lies?
"
"Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report
"
"Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
[p]put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
[p]the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
"
"'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
"
"Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
[p]their queen.
"
"Not since widow Dido's time.
"
"Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
[p]widow Dido!
"
"What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
[p]how you take it!
"
"'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
[p]she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
"
"This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
"
"Carthage?
"
"I assure you, Carthage.
"
"His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
[p]raised the wall and houses too.
"
"What impossible matter will he make easy next?
"
"I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
[p]and give it his son for an apple.
"
"And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
[p]forth more islands.
"
"Ay.
"
"Why, in good time.
"
"Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
[p]as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
[p]of your daughter, who is now queen.
"
"And the rarest that e'er came there.
"
"Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
"
"O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
"
"Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
[p]wore it? I mean, in a sort.
"
"That sort was well fished for.
"
"When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
"
"You cram these words into mine ears against
[p]The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
[p]Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
[p]My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
[p]Who is so far from Italy removed
[p]I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
[p]Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
[p]Hath made his meal on thee?
"
"Sir, he may live:
[p]I saw him beat the surges under him,
[p]And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
[p]Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
[p]The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
[p]'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
[p]Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
[p]To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
[p]As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
[p]He came alive to land.
"
"No, no, he's gone.
"
"Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
[p]That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
[p]But rather lose her to an African;
[p]Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
[p]Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
"
"Prithee, peace.
"
"You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
[p]By all of us, and the fair soul herself
[p]Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
[p]Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
[p]son,
[p]I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
[p]More widows in them of this business' making
[p]Than we bring men to comfort them:
[p]The fault's your own.
"
"So is the dear'st o' the loss.
"
"My lord Sebastian,
[p]The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
[p]And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
[p]When you should bring the plaster.
"
"Very well.
"
"And most chirurgeonly.
"
"It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
[p]When you are cloudy.
"
"Foul weather?
"
"Very foul.
"
"Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
"
"He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
"
"Or docks, or mallows.
"
"And were the king on't, what would I do?
"
"'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
"
"I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
[p]Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
[p]Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
[p]Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
[p]And use of service, none; contract, succession,
[p]Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
[p]No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
[p]No occupation; all men idle, all;
[p]And women too, but innocent and pure;
[p]No sovereignty;--
"
"Yet he would be king on't.
"
"The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
[p]beginning.
"
"All things in common nature should produce
[p]Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
[p]Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
[p]Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
[p]Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
[p]To feed my innocent people.
"
"No marrying 'mong his subjects?
"
"None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
"
"I would with such perfection govern, sir,
[p]To excel the golden age.
"
"God save his majesty!
"
"Long live Gonzalo!
"
"And,--do you mark me, sir?
"
"Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
"
"I do well believe your highness; and
[p]did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
[p]who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
[p]they always use to laugh at nothing.
"
"'Twas you we laughed at.
"
"Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
[p]to you: so you may continue and laugh at
[p]nothing still.
"
"What a blow was there given!
"
"An it had not fallen flat-long.
"
"You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
[p]the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
[p]in it five weeks without changing.
"
"We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
"
"Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
"
"No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
[p]my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
[p]me asleep, for I am very heavy?
"
"Go sleep, and hear us.
"
"What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
[p]Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
[p]They are inclined to do so.
"
"Please you, sir,
[p]Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
[p]It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
[p]It is a comforter.
"
"We two, my lord,
[p]Will guard your person while you take your rest,
[p]And watch your safety.
"
"Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
"
"What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
"
"It is the quality o' the climate.
"
"Why
[p]Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
[p]Myself disposed to sleep.
"
"Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
[p]They fell together all, as by consent;
[p]They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
[p]Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
[p]And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
[p]What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
[p]My strong imagination sees a crown
[p]Dropping upon thy head.
"
"What, art thou waking?
"
"Do you not hear me speak?
"
"I do; and surely
[p]It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
[p]Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
[p]This is a strange repose, to be asleep
[p]With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
[p]And yet so fast asleep.
"
"Noble Sebastian,
[p]Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
[p]Whiles thou art waking.
"
"Thou dost snore distinctly;
[p]There's meaning in thy snores.
"
"I am more serious than my custom: you
[p]Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
[p]Trebles thee o'er.
"
"Well, I am standing water.
"
"I'll teach you how to flow.
"
"Do so: to ebb
[p]Hereditary sloth instructs me.
"
"O,
[p]If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
[p]Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
[p]You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
[p]Most often do so near the bottom run
[p]By their own fear or sloth.
"
"Prithee, say on:
[p]The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
[p]A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
[p]Which throes thee much to yield.
"
"Thus, sir:
[p]Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
[p]Who shall be of as little memory
[p]When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
[p]For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
[p]Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
[p]'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
[p]And he that sleeps here swims.
"
"I have no hope
[p]That he's undrown'd.
"
"O, out of that 'no hope'
[p]What great hope have you! no hope that way is
[p]Another way so high a hope that even
[p]Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
[p]But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
[p]That Ferdinand is drown'd?
"
"He's gone.
"
"Then, tell me,
[p]Who's the next heir of Naples?
"
"Claribel.
"
"She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
[p]Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
[p]Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
[p]The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
[p]Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
[p]We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
[p]And by that destiny to perform an act
[p]Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
[p]In yours and my discharge.
"
"What stuff is this! how say you?
[p]'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
[p]So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
[p]There is some space.
"
"A space whose every cubit
[p]Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
[p]Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
[p]And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
[p]That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
[p]Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
[p]As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
[p]As amply and unnecessarily
[p]As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
[p]A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
[p]The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
[p]For your advancement! Do you understand me?
"
"Methinks I do.
"
"And how does your content
[p]Tender your own good fortune?
"
"I remember
[p]You did supplant your brother Prospero.
"
"True:
[p]And look how well my garments sit upon me;
[p]Much feater than before: my brother's servants
[p]Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
"
"But, for your conscience?
"
"Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
[p]'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
[p]This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
[p]That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
[p]And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
[p]No better than the earth he lies upon,
[p]If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
[p]Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
[p]Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
[p]To the perpetual wink for aye might put
[p]This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
[p]Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
[p]They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
[p]They'll tell the clock to any business that
[p]We say befits the hour.
"
"Thy case, dear friend,
[p]Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
[p]I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
[p]Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
[p]And I the king shall love thee.
"
"Draw together;
[p]And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
[p]To fall it on Gonzalo.
"
"O, but one word.
"
"My master through his art foresees the danger
[p]That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
[p]For else his project dies--to keep them living.
[p][Sings in GONZALO's ear]
[p]While you here do snoring lie,
[p]Open-eyed conspiracy
[p]His time doth take.
[p]If of life you keep a care,
[p]Shake off slumber, and beware:
[p]Awake, awake!
"
"Then let us both be sudden.
"
"Now, good angels
[p]Preserve the king.
"
"Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
[p]Wherefore this ghastly looking?
"
"What's the matter?
"
"Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
[p]Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
[p]Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
[p]It struck mine ear most terribly.
"
"I heard nothing.
"
"O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
[p]To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
[p]Of a whole herd of lions.
"
"Heard you this, Gonzalo?
"
"Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
[p]And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
[p]I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
[p]I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
[p]That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
[p]Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.
"
"Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
[p]For my poor son.
"
"Heavens keep him from these beasts!
[p]For he is, sure, i' the island.
"
"Lead away.
"
"Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
[p]So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.
"
"All the infections that the sun sucks up
[p]From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
[p]By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
[p]And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
[p]Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,
[p]Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
[p]Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
[p]For every trifle are they set upon me;
[p]Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
[p]And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
[p]Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
[p]Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
[p]All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
[p]Do hiss me into madness.
[p][Enter TRINCULO]
[p]Lo, now, lo!
[p]Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
[p]For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
[p]Perchance he will not mind me.
"
"Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off
[p]any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
[p]I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
[p]cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
[p]bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
[p]should thunder as it did before, I know not
[p]where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
[p]choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
[p]here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
[p]he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
[p]like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
[p]John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
[p]as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
[p]not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
[p]of silver: there would this monster make a
[p]man; any strange beast there makes a man:
[p]when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
[p]beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
[p]Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
[p]arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
[p]my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
[p]but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
[p]thunderbolt.
[p][Thunder]
[p]Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to
[p]creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
[p]shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
[p]strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
[p]dregs of the storm be past.
"
"I shall no more to sea, to sea,
[p]Here shall I die ashore--
[p]This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
[p]funeral: well, here's my comfort. [Drinks]
[p][Sings]
[p]The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
[p]The gunner and his mate
[p]Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
[p]But none of us cared for Kate;
[p]For she had a tongue with a tang,
[p]Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
[p]She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
[p]Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:
[p]Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
[p]This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
"
"Do not torment me: Oh!
"
"What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
[p]tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
[p]have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
[p]four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as
[p]ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
[p]and it shall be said so again while Stephano
[p]breathes at's nostrils.
"
"The spirit torments me; Oh!
"
"This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
[p]hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
[p]should he learn our language? I will give him some
[p]relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
[p]and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a
[p]present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
"
"Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.
"
"He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
[p]wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
[p]never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
[p]fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
[p]not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
[p]hath him, and that soundly.
"
"Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I
[p]know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.
"
"Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
[p]which will give language to you, cat: open your
[p]mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
[p]and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:
[p]open your chaps again.
"
"I should know that voice: it should be--but he is
[p]drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!
"
"Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
[p]His forward voice now is to speak well of his
[p]friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
[p]and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
[p]recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
[p]will pour some in thy other mouth.
"
"Stephano!
"
"Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is
[p]a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no
[p]long spoon.
"
"Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and
[p]speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy
[p]good friend Trinculo.
"
"If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee
[p]by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,
[p]these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
[p]camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
[p]he vent Trinculos?
"
"I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
[p]art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
[p]not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
[p]under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
[p]the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O
[p]Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!
"
"Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
"
"[Aside] These be fine things, an if they be
[p]not sprites.
[p]That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
[p]I will kneel to him.
"
"How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
[p]swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
[p]escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
[p]heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
[p]the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
[p]cast ashore.
"
"I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
[p]for the liquor is not earthly.
"
"Here; swear then how thou escapedst.
"
"Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a
[p]duck, I'll be sworn.
"
"Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
[p]duck, thou art made like a goose.
"
"O Stephano. hast any more of this?
"
"The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the
[p]sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
[p]how does thine ague?
"
"Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
"
"Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'
[p]the moon when time was.
"
"I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
[p]My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
"
"Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
[p]it anon with new contents swear.
"
"By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
[p]I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
[p]the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
[p]drawn, monster, in good sooth!
"
"I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
[p]And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.
"
"By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
[p]monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.
"
"I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.
"
"Come on then; down, and swear.
"
"I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
[p]monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
[p]heart to beat him,--
"
"Come, kiss.
"
"But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!
"
"I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
[p]I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
[p]A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
[p]I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
[p]Thou wondrous man.
"
"A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a
[p]Poor drunkard!
"
"I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
[p]And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
[p]Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
[p]To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
[p]To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
[p]Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
"
"I prithee now, lead the way without any more
[p]talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company
[p]else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;
[p]bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by
[p]and by again.
"
"[Sings drunkenly]
[p]Farewell master; farewell, farewell!
"
"A howling monster: a drunken monster!
"
"No more dams I'll make for fish
[p]Nor fetch in firing
[p]At requiring;
[p]Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish
[p]'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
[p]Has a new master: get a new man.
[p]Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
[p]hey-day, freedom!
"
"O brave monster! Lead the way.
"
"There be some sports are painful, and their labour
[p]Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
[p]Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
[p]Point to rich ends. This my mean task
[p]Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
[p]The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
[p]And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
[p]Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
[p]And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
[p]Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
[p]Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
[p]Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
[p]Had never like executor. I forget:
[p]But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
[p]Most busy lest, when I do it.
"
"Alas, now, pray you,
[p]Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
[p]Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
[p]Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
[p]'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
[p]Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
[p]He's safe for these three hours.
"
"O most dear mistress,
[p]The sun will set before I shall discharge
[p]What I must strive to do.
"
"If you'll sit down,
[p]I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
[p]I'll carry it to the pile.
"
"No, precious creature;
[p]I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
[p]Than you should such dishonour undergo,
[p]While I sit lazy by.
"
"It would become me
[p]As well as it does you: and I should do it
[p]With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
[p]And yours it is against.
"
"Poor worm, thou art infected!
[p]This visitation shows it.
"
"You look wearily.
"
"No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me
[p]When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
[p]Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
[p]What is your name?
"
"Miranda.--O my father,
[p]I have broke your hest to say so!
"
"Admired Miranda!
[p]Indeed the top of admiration! worth
[p]What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
[p]I have eyed with best regard and many a time
[p]The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
[p]Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
[p]Have I liked several women; never any
[p]With so fun soul, but some defect in her
[p]Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
[p]And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
[p]So perfect and so peerless, are created
[p]Of every creature's best!
"
"I do not know
[p]One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
[p]Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
[p]More that I may call men than you, good friend,
[p]And my dear father: how features are abroad,
[p]I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
[p]The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
[p]Any companion in the world but you,
[p]Nor can imagination form a shape,
[p]Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
[p]Something too wildly and my father's precepts
[p]I therein do forget.
"
"I am in my condition
[p]A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
[p]I would, not so!--and would no more endure
[p]This wooden slavery than to suffer
[p]The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
[p]The very instant that I saw you, did
[p]My heart fly to your service; there resides,
[p]To make me slave to it; and for your sake
[p]Am I this patient log--man.
"
"Do you love me?
"
"O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
[p]And crown what I profess with kind event
[p]If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
[p]What best is boded me to mischief! I
[p]Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
[p]Do love, prize, honour you.
"
"I am a fool
[p]To weep at what I am glad of.
"
"Fair encounter
[p]Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
[p]On that which breeds between 'em!
"
"Wherefore weep you?
"
"At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
[p]What I desire to give, and much less take
[p]What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
[p]And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
[p]The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
[p]And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
[p]I am your wife, it you will marry me;
[p]If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
[p]You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
[p]Whether you will or no.
"
"My mistress, dearest;
[p]And I thus humble ever.
"
"My husband, then?
"
"Ay, with a heart as willing
[p]As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
"
"And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell
[p]Till half an hour hence.
"
"A thousand thousand!
"
"So glad of this as they I cannot be,
[p]Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
[p]At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
[p]For yet ere supper-time must I perform
[p]Much business appertaining.
"
"Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink
[p]water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and
[p]board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.
"
"Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
[p]say there's but five upon this isle: we are three
[p]of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the
[p]state totters.
"
"Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
[p]are almost set in thy head.
"
"Where should they be set else? he were a brave
[p]monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
"
"My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
[p]for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I
[p]could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
[p]and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
[p]monster, or my standard.
"
"Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
"
"We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
"
"Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
[p]nothing neither.
"
"Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
[p]good moon-calf.
"
"How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
[p]I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
"
"Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to
[p]justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
[p]was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
[p]sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
[p]being but half a fish and half a monster?
"
"Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?
"
"'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!
"
"Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.
"
"Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
[p]prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's
[p]my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
"
"I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
[p]hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
"
"Marry, will I. kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
[p]and so shall Trinculo.
"
"As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a
[p]sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
"
"Thou liest.
"
"Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my
[p]valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.
"
"Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by
[p]this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
"
"Why, I said nothing.
"
"Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
"
"I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
[p]From me he got it. if thy greatness will
[p]Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
[p]But this thing dare not,--
"
"That's most certain.
"
"Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
"
"How now shall this be compassed?
[p]Canst thou bring me to the party?
"
"Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
[p]Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.
"
"Thou liest; thou canst not.
"
"What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
[p]I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
[p]And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
[p]He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
[p]Where the quick freshes are.
"
"Trinculo, run into no further danger:
[p]interrupt the monster one word further, and,
[p]by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors
[p]and make a stock-fish of thee.
"
"Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
[p]off.
"
"Didst thou not say he lied?
"
"Thou liest.
"
"Do I so? take thou that.
[p][Beats TRINCULO]
[p]As you like this, give me the lie another time.
"
"I did not give the lie. Out o' your
[p]wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
[p]this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
[p]your monster, and the devil take your fingers!
"
"Ha, ha, ha!
"
"Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
[p]off.
"
"Beat him enough: after a little time
[p]I'll beat him too.
"
"Stand farther. Come, proceed.
"
"Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
[p]I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
[p]Having first seized his books, or with a log
[p]Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
[p]Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
[p]First to possess his books; for without them
[p]He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
[p]One spirit to command: they all do hate him
[p]As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
[p]He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
[p]Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
[p]And that most deeply to consider is
[p]The beauty of his daughter; he himself
[p]Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
[p]But only Sycorax my dam and she;
[p]But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
[p]As great'st does least.
"
"Is it so brave a lass?
"
"Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
[p]And bring thee forth brave brood.
"
"Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
[p]will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
[p]Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
[p]like the plot, Trinculo?
"
"Excellent.
"
"Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
[p]while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
"
"Within this half hour will he be asleep:
[p]Wilt thou destroy him then?
"
"Ay, on mine honour.
"
"This will I tell my master.
"
"Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
[p]Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
[p]You taught me but while-ere?
"
"At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
[p]reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
[p][Sings]
[p]Flout 'em and scout 'em
[p]And scout 'em and flout 'em
[p]Thought is free.
"
"That's not the tune.
"
"What is this same?
"
"This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
[p]of Nobody.
"
"If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
[p]if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
"
"O, forgive me my sins!
"
"He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
"
"Art thou afeard?
"
"No, monster, not I.
"
"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
[p]Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
[p]Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
[p]Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
[p]That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
[p]Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
[p]The clouds methought would open and show riches
[p]Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
[p]I cried to dream again.
"
"This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
[p]have my music for nothing.
"
"When Prospero is destroyed.
"
"That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
"
"The sound is going away; let's follow it, and
[p]after do our work.
"
"Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see
[p]this tabourer; he lays it on.
"
"Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.
"
"By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
[p]My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
[p]Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
[p]I needs must rest me.
"
"Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
[p]Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
[p]To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
[p]Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
[p]No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
[p]Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
[p]Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
"
"[Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so
[p]out of hope.
[p]Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
[p]That you resolved to effect.
"
"[Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage
[p]Will we take throughly.
"
"[Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night;
[p]For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
[p]Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
[p]As when they are fresh.
"
"[Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more.
"
"What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
"
"Marvellous sweet music!
[p][Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several]
[p]strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;
[p]they dance about it with gentle actions of
[p]salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to
[p]eat, they depart]
"
"Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
"
"A living drollery. Now I will believe
[p]That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
[p]There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
[p]At this hour reigning there.
"
"I'll believe both;
[p]And what does else want credit, come to me,
[p]And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
[p]lie,
[p]Though fools at home condemn 'em.
"
"If in Naples
[p]I should report this now, would they believe me?
[p]If I should say, I saw such islanders--
[p]For, certes, these are people of the island--
[p]Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
[p]Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
[p]Our human generation you shall find
[p]Many, nay, almost any.
"
"[Aside] Honest lord,
[p]Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
[p]Are worse than devils.
"
"I cannot too much muse
[p]Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
[p]Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
[p]Of excellent dumb discourse.
"
"[Aside]. Praise in departing.
"
"They vanish'd strangely.
"
"No matter, since
[p]They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
[p]Will't please you taste of what is here?
"
"Not I.
"
"Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
[p]Who would believe that there were mountaineers
[p]Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
[p]Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
[p]Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
[p]Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
[p]Good warrant of.
"
"I will stand to and feed,
[p]Although my last: no matter, since I feel
[p]The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
[p]Stand to and do as we.
[p][Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a]
[p]harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and,
[p]with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes]
"
"You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
[p]That hath to instrument this lower world
[p]And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
[p]Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
[p]Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
[p]Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
[p]And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
[p]Their proper selves.
[p][ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &c. draw their swords]
[p]You fools! I and my fellows
[p]Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
[p]Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
[p]Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
[p]Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
[p]One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
[p]Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
[p]Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
[p]And will not be uplifted. But remember--
[p]For that's my business to you--that you three
[p]From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
[p]Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
[p]Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
[p]The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
[p]Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
[p]Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
[p]They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
[p]Lingering perdition, worse than any death
[p]Can be at once, shall step by step attend
[p]You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
[p]Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
[p]Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
[p]And a clear life ensuing.
[p][He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music]
[p]enter the Shapes again, and dance, with
[p]mocks and mows, and carrying out the table]
"
"Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
[p]Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
[p]Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
[p]In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
[p]And observation strange, my meaner ministers
[p]Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
[p]And these mine enemies are all knit up
[p]In their distractions; they now are in my power;
[p]And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
[p]Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
[p]And his and mine loved darling.
"
"I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
[p]In this strange stare?
"
"O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
[p]Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
[p]The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
[p]That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
[p]The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
[p]Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
[p]I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
[p]And with him there lie mudded.
"
"But one fiend at a time,
[p]I'll fight their legions o'er.
"
"I'll be thy second.
"
"All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
[p]Like poison given to work a great time after,
[p]Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
[p]That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
[p]And hinder them from what this ecstasy
[p]May now provoke them to.
"
"Follow, I pray you.
"
"If I have too austerely punish'd you,
[p]Your compensation makes amends, for I
[p]Have given you here a third of mine own life,
[p]Or that for which I live; who once again
[p]I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
[p]Were but my trials of thy love and thou
[p]Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,
[p]I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
[p]Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
[p]For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
[p]And make it halt behind her.
"
"I do believe it
[p]Against an oracle.
"
"Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
[p]Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
[p]If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
[p]All sanctimonious ceremonies may
[p]With full and holy rite be minister'd,
[p]No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
[p]To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
[p]Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
[p]The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
[p]That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
[p]As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
"
"As I hope
[p]For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
[p]With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
[p]The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.
[p]Our worser genius can, shall never melt
[p]Mine honour into lust, to take away
[p]The edge of that day's celebration
[p]When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
[p]Or Night kept chain'd below.
"
"Fairly spoke.
[p]Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
[p]What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!
"
"What would my potent master? here I am.
"
"Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
[p]Did worthily perform; and I must use you
[p]In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
[p]O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
[p]Incite them to quick motion; for I must
[p]Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
[p]Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
[p]And they expect it from me.
"
"Presently?
"
"Ay, with a twink.
"
"Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
[p]And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
[p]Each one, tripping on his toe,
[p]Will be here with mop and mow.
[p]Do you love me, master? no?
"
"Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
[p]Till thou dost hear me call.
"
"Well, I conceive.
"
"Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
[p]Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
[p]To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
[p]Or else, good night your vow!
"
"I warrant you sir;
[p]The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
[p]Abates the ardour of my liver.
"
"Well.
[p]Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
[p]Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!
[p]No tongue! all eyes! be silent.
"
"Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
[p]Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
[p]Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
[p]And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
[p]Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
[p]Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
[p]To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,
[p]Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
[p]Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;
[p]And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
[p]Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
[p]Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
[p]Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
[p]Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
[p]To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
[p]Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
"
"Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
[p]Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
[p]Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
[p]Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
[p]And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
[p]My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
[p]Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
[p]Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?
"
"A contract of true love to celebrate;
[p]And some donation freely to estate
[p]On the blest lovers.
"
"Tell me, heavenly bow,
[p]If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
[p]Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
[p]The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
[p]Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
[p]I have forsworn.
"
"Of her society
[p]Be not afraid: I met her deity
[p]Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
[p]Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
[p]Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
[p]Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
[p]Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;
[p]Mars's hot minion is returned again;
[p]Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
[p]Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
[p]And be a boy right out.
"
"High'st queen of state,
[p]Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
"
"How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
[p]To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be
[p]And honour'd in their issue.
"
"Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
[p]Long continuance, and increasing,
[p]Hourly joys be still upon you!
[p]Juno sings her blessings upon you.
"
"Earth's increase, foison plenty,
[p]Barns and garners never empty,
[p]Vines and clustering bunches growing,
[p]Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
[p]Spring come to you at the farthest
[p]In the very end of harvest!
[p]Scarcity and want shall shun you;
[p]Ceres' blessing so is on you.
"
"This is a most majestic vision, and
[p]Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold
[p]To think these spirits?
"
"Spirits, which by mine art
[p]I have from their confines call'd to enact
[p]My present fancies.
"
"Let me live here ever;
[p]So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
[p]Makes this place Paradise.
[p][Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on]
[p]employment]
"
"Sweet, now, silence!
[p]Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
[p]There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
[p]Or else our spell is marr'd.
"
"You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
[p]With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
[p]Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
[p]Answer your summons; Juno does command:
[p]Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
[p]A contract of true love; be not too late.
[p][Enter certain Nymphs]
[p]You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
[p]Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
[p]Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
[p]And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
[p]In country footing.
[p][Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they]
[p]join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;
[p]towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts
[p]suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a
[p]strange, hollow, and confused noise, they
[p]heavily vanish]
"
"[Aside] I had forgot that foul conspiracy
[p]Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
[p]Against my life: the minute of their plot
[p]Is almost come.
[p][To the Spirits]
[p]Well done! avoid; no more!
"
"This is strange: your father's in some passion
[p]That works him strongly.
"
"Never till this day
[p]Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
"
"You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
[p]As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
[p]Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
[p]As I foretold you, were all spirits and
[p]Are melted into air, into thin air:
[p]And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
[p]The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
[p]The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
[p]Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
[p]And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
[p]Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
[p]As dreams are made on, and our little life
[p]Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
[p]Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:
[p]Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
[p]If you be pleased, retire into my cell
[p]And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
[p]To still my beating mind.
"
"[with Miranda] We wish your peace.
"
"Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.
"
"Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
"
"Spirit,
[p]We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
"
"Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
[p]I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
[p]Lest I might anger thee.
"
"Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
"
"I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
[p]So fun of valour that they smote the air
[p]For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
[p]For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
[p]Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
[p]At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
[p]their ears,
[p]Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
[p]As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
[p]That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
[p]Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
[p]Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
[p]I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
[p]There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
[p]O'erstunk their feet.
"
"This was well done, my bird.
[p]Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
[p]The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
[p]For stale to catch these thieves.
"
"I go, I go.
"
"A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
[p]Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
[p]Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
[p]And as with age his body uglier grows,
[p]So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
[p]Even to roaring.

"
"Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
[p]Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
"
"Monster, your fairy, which you say is
[p]a harmless fairy, has done little better than
[p]played the Jack with us.
"
"Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at
[p]which my nose is in great indignation.
"
"So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take
[p]a displeasure against you, look you,--
"
"Thou wert but a lost monster.
"
"Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
[p]Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
[p]Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
[p]All's hush'd as midnight yet.
"
"Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--
"
"There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
[p]monster, but an infinite loss.
"
"That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
[p]harmless fairy, monster.
"
"I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
[p]for my labour.
"
"Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
[p]This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
[p]Do that good mischief which may make this island
[p]Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
[p]For aye thy foot-licker.
"
"Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
"
"O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
[p]what a wardrobe here is for thee!
"
"Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
"
"O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
[p]O king Stephano!
"
"Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have
[p]that gown.
"
"Thy grace shall have it.
"
"The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
[p]To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
[p]And do the murder first: if he awake,
[p]From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
[p]Make us strange stuff.
"
"Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
[p]is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
[p]the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
[p]hair and prove a bald jerkin.
"
"Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.
"
"I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
[p]wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
[p]country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
[p]pass of pate; there's another garment for't.
"
"Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and
[p]away with the rest.
"
"I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
[p]And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
[p]With foreheads villanous low.
"
"Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
[p]away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you
[p]out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.
"
"And this.
"
"Ay, and this.
[p][A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,]
[p]in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about,
[p]PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on]
"
"Hey, Mountain, hey!
"
"Silver I there it goes, Silver!
"
"Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
[p][CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are]
[p]driven out]
[p]Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
[p]With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
[p]With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
[p]Than pard or cat o' mountain.
"
"Hark, they roar!
"
"Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
[p]Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
[p]Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
[p]Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
[p]Follow, and do me service.
"
"Now does my project gather to a head:
[p]My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
[p]Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
"
"On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
[p]You said our work should cease.
"
"I did say so,
[p]When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
[p]How fares the king and's followers?
"
"Confined together
[p]In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
[p]Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
[p]In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
[p]They cannot budge till your release. The king,
[p]His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
[p]And the remainder mourning over them,
[p]Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
[p]Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'
[p]His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
[p]From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
[p]That if you now beheld them, your affections
[p]Would become tender.
"
"Dost thou think so, spirit?
"
"Mine would, sir, were I human.
"
"And mine shall.
[p]Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
[p]Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
[p]One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
[p]Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
[p]Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
[p]Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
[p]Do I take part: the rarer action is
[p]In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
[p]The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
[p]Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
[p]My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
[p]And they shall be themselves.
"
"I'll fetch them, sir.
"
"Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
[p]And ye that on the sands with printless foot
[p]Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
[p]When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
[p]By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
[p]Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
[p]Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
[p]To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
[p]Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
[p]The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
[p]And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
[p]Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
[p]Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
[p]With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
[p]Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
[p]The pine and cedar: graves at my command
[p]Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
[p]By my so potent art. But this rough magic
[p]I here abjure, and, when I have required
[p]Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
[p]To work mine end upon their senses that
[p]This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
[p]Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
[p]And deeper than did ever plummet sound
[p]I'll drown my book.
[p][Solemn music]
[p][Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a]
[p]frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;
[p]SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,
[p]attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all
[p]enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,
[p]and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO
[p]observing, speaks:]
[p]A solemn air and the best comforter
[p]To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
[p]Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
[p]For you are spell-stopp'd.
[p]Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
[p]Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
[p]Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
[p]And as the morning steals upon the night,
[p]Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
[p]Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
[p]Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
[p]My true preserver, and a loyal sir
[p]To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
[p]Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
[p]Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
[p]Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
[p]Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
[p]You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
[p]Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
[p]Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
[p]Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
[p]Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
[p]Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
[p]Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
[p]That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
[p]That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
[p]Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
[p]I will discase me, and myself present
[p]As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
[p]Thou shalt ere long be free.
[p][ARIEL sings and helps to attire him]
[p]Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
[p]In a cowslip's bell I lie;
[p]There I couch when owls do cry.
[p]On the bat's back I do fly
[p]After summer merrily.
[p]Merrily, merrily shall I live now
[p]Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
"
"Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:
[p]But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
[p]To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
[p]There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
[p]Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
[p]Being awake, enforce them to this place,
[p]And presently, I prithee.
"
"I drink the air before me, and return
[p]Or ere your pulse twice beat.
"
"All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
[p]Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
[p]Out of this fearful country!
"
"Behold, sir king,
[p]The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
[p]For more assurance that a living prince
[p]Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
[p]And to thee and thy company I bid
[p]A hearty welcome.
"
"Whether thou best he or no,
[p]Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
[p]As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
[p]Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
[p]The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
[p]I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
[p]An if this be at all, a most strange story.
[p]Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
[p]Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
[p]Be living and be here?
"
"First, noble friend,
[p]Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
[p]Be measured or confined.
"
"Whether this be
[p]Or be not, I'll not swear.
"
"You do yet taste
[p]Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
[p]Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
[p][Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]
[p]But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
[p]I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
[p]And justify you traitors: at this time
[p]I will tell no tales.
"
"[Aside] The devil speaks in him.
"
"No.
[p]For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
[p]Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
[p]Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
[p]My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
[p]Thou must restore.
"
"If thou be'st Prospero,
[p]Give us particulars of thy preservation;
[p]How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
[p]Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
[p]How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
[p]My dear son Ferdinand.
"
"I am woe for't, sir.
"
"Irreparable is the loss, and patience
[p]Says it is past her cure.
"
"I rather think
[p]You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
[p]For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
[p]And rest myself content.
"
"You the like loss!
"
"As great to me as late; and, supportable
[p]To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
[p]Than you may call to comfort you, for I
[p]Have lost my daughter.
"
"A daughter?
[p]O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
[p]The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
[p]Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
[p]Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
"
"In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
[p]At this encounter do so much admire
[p]That they devour their reason and scarce think
[p]Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
[p]Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
[p]Been justled from your senses, know for certain
[p]That I am Prospero and that very duke
[p]Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
[p]Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
[p]To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
[p]For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
[p]Not a relation for a breakfast nor
[p]Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
[p]This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
[p]And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
[p]My dukedom since you have given me again,
[p]I will requite you with as good a thing;
[p]At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
[p]As much as me my dukedom.
[p][Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA]
[p]playing at chess]
"
"Sweet lord, you play me false.
"
"No, my dear'st love,
[p]I would not for the world.
"
"Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
[p]And I would call it, fair play.
"
"If this prove
[p]A vision of the Island, one dear son
[p]Shall I twice lose.
"
"A most high miracle!
"
"Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
[p]I have cursed them without cause.
"
"Now all the blessings
[p]Of a glad father compass thee about!
[p]Arise, and say how thou camest here.
"
"O, wonder!
[p]How many goodly creatures are there here!
[p]How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
[p]That has such people in't!
"
"'Tis new to thee.
"
"What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
[p]Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
[p]Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
[p]And brought us thus together?
"
"Sir, she is mortal;
[p]But by immortal Providence she's mine:
[p]I chose her when I could not ask my father
[p]For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
[p]Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
[p]Of whom so often I have heard renown,
[p]But never saw before; of whom I have
[p]Received a second life; and second father
[p]This lady makes him to me.
"
"I am hers:
[p]But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
[p]Must ask my child forgiveness!
"
"There, sir, stop:
[p]Let us not burthen our remembrance with
[p]A heaviness that's gone.
"
"I have inly wept,
[p]Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
[p]And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
[p]For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
[p]Which brought us hither.
"
"I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
"
"Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
[p]Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
[p]Beyond a common joy, and set it down
[p]With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
[p]Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
[p]And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
[p]Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
[p]In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
[p]When no man was his own.
"
"[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands:
[p]Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
[p]That doth not wish you joy!
"
"Be it so! Amen!
[p][Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain]
[p]amazedly following]
[p]O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
[p]I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
[p]This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
[p]That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
[p]Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
"
"The best news is, that we have safely found
[p]Our king and company; the next, our ship--
[p]Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
[p]Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
[p]We first put out to sea.
"
"[Aside to PROSPERO] Sir, all this service
[p]Have I done since I went.
"
"[Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit!
"
"These are not natural events; they strengthen
[p]From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
"
"If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
[p]I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
[p]And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
[p]Where but even now with strange and several noises
[p]Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
[p]And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
[p]We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
[p]Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
[p]Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
[p]Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
[p]Even in a dream, were we divided from them
[p]And were brought moping hither.
"
"[Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done?
"
"[Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
"
"This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
[p]And there is in this business more than nature
[p]Was ever conduct of: some oracle
[p]Must rectify our knowledge.
"
"Sir, my liege,
[p]Do not infest your mind with beating on
[p]The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
[p]Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
[p]Which to you shall seem probable, of every
[p]These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
[p]And think of each thing well.

[p]Some few odd lads that you remember not.

"Every man shift for all the rest, and
[p]let no man take care for himself; for all is
[p]but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!
"
"If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
[p]here's a goodly sight.
"
"O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
[p]How fine my master is! I am afraid
[p]He will chastise me.
"
"Ha, ha!
[p]What things are these, my lord Antonio?
[p]Will money buy 'em?
"
"Very like; one of them
[p]Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.
"
"Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
[p]Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
[p]His mother was a witch, and one so strong
[p]That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
[p]And deal in her command without her power.
[p]These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--
[p]For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
[p]To take my life. Two of these fellows you
[p]Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
[p]Acknowledge mine.
"
"I shall be pinch'd to death.
"
"Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
"
"He is drunk now: where had he wine?
"
"And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
[p]Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
[p]How camest thou in this pickle?
"
"I have been in such a pickle since I
[p]saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
[p]my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.
"
"Why, how now, Stephano!
"
"O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
"
"You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?
"
"I should have been a sore one then.
"
"This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
"
"He is as disproportion'd in his manners
[p]As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
[p]Take with you your companions; as you look
[p]To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
"
"Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
[p]And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
[p]Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
[p]And worship this dull fool!
"
"Go to; away!
"
"Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
"
"Or stole it, rather.
"
"Sir, I invite your highness and your train
[p]To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
[p]For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
[p]With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
[p]Go quick away; the story of my life
[p]And the particular accidents gone by
[p]Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
[p]I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
[p]Where I have hope to see the nuptial
[p]Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
[p]And thence retire me to my Milan, where
[p]Every third thought shall be my grave.
"
"I long
[p]To hear the story of your life, which must
[p]Take the ear strangely.
"
"I'll deliver all;
[p]And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
[p]And sail so expeditious that shall catch
[p]Your royal fleet far off.

[p]EPILOGUE
"
"Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
[p]And what strength I have's mine own,
[p]Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
[p]I must be here confined by you,
[p]Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
[p]Since I have my dukedom got
[p]And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
[p]In this bare island by your spell;
[p]But release me from my bands
[p]With the help of your good hands:
[p]Gentle breath of yours my sails
[p]Must fill, or else my project fails,
[p]Which was to please. Now I want
[p]Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
[p]And my ending is despair,
[p]Unless I be relieved by prayer,
[p]Which pierces so that it assaults
[p]Mercy itself and frees all faults.
[p]As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
[p]Let your indulgence set me free."
"If music be the food of love, play on;
[p]Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
[p]The appetite may sicken, and so die.
[p]That strain again! it had a dying fall:
[p]O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
[p]That breathes upon a bank of violets,
[p]Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
[p]'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
[p]O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
[p]That, notwithstanding thy capacity
[p]Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
[p]Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
[p]But falls into abatement and low price,
[p]Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
[p]That it alone is high fantastical.
"
"Will you go hunt, my lord?
"
"What, Curio?
"
"The hart.
"
"Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
[p]O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
[p]Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
[p]That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
[p]And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
[p]E'er since pursue me.
[p][Enter VALENTINE]
[p]How now! what news from her?
"
"So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
[p]But from her handmaid do return this answer:
[p]The element itself, till seven years' heat,
[p]Shall not behold her face at ample view;
[p]But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
[p]And water once a day her chamber round
[p]With eye-offending brine: all this to season
[p]A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
[p]And lasting in her sad remembrance.
"
"O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
[p]To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
[p]How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
[p]Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
[p]That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
[p]These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
[p]Her sweet perfections with one self king!
[p]Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
[p]Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.

"This is Illyria, lady.

"And what should I do in Illyria?
[p]My brother he is in Elysium.
[p]Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?
"
"It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
"
"O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
"
"True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
[p]Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
[p]When you and those poor number saved with you
[p]Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
[p]Most provident in peril, bind himself,
[p]Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
[p]To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
[p]Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
[p]I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
[p]So long as I could see.
"
"For saying so, there's gold:
[p]Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
[p]Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
[p]The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
"
"Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
[p]Not three hours' travel from this very place.
"
"Who governs here?
"
"A noble duke, in nature as in name.
"
"What is the name?
"
"Orsino.
"
"Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
[p]He was a bachelor then.
"
"And so is now, or was so very late;
[p]For but a month ago I went from hence,
[p]And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
[p]What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
[p]That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
"
"What's she?
"
"A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
[p]That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
[p]In the protection of his son, her brother,
[p]Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
[p]They say, she hath abjured the company
[p]And sight of men.
"
"O that I served that lady
[p]And might not be delivered to the world,
[p]Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
[p]What my estate is!
"
"That were hard to compass;
[p]Because she will admit no kind of suit,
[p]No, not the duke's.
"
"There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
[p]And though that nature with a beauteous wall
[p]Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
[p]I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
[p]With this thy fair and outward character.
[p]I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
[p]Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
[p]For such disguise as haply shall become
[p]The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
[p]Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
[p]It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
[p]And speak to him in many sorts of music
[p]That will allow me very worth his service.
[p]What else may hap to time I will commit;
[p]Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
"
"Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
[p]When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
"
"I thank thee: lead me on.
"
"What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
[p]her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
"
"By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
[p]nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
[p]exceptions to your ill hours.
"
"Why, let her except, before excepted.
"
"Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
[p]limits of order.
"
"Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
[p]these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
[p]these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
[p]themselves in their own straps.
"
"That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
[p]my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
[p]knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
"
"Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
"
"Ay, he.
"
"He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
"
"What's that to the purpose?
"
"Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
"
"Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
[p]he's a very fool and a prodigal.
"
"Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
[p]viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
[p]word for word without book, and hath all the good
[p]gifts of nature.
"
"He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
[p]he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
[p]he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
[p]hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
[p]he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
"
"By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
[p]that say so of him. Who are they?
"
"They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
"
"With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
[p]her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
[p]drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
[p]that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
[p]o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
[p]Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
"
"Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
"
"Sweet Sir Andrew!
"
"Bless you, fair shrew.
"
"And you too, sir.
"
"Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
"
"What's that?
"
"My niece's chambermaid.
"
"Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
"
"My name is Mary, sir.
"
"Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
"
"You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
[p]her, woo her, assail her.
"
"By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
[p]company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
"
"Fare you well, gentlemen.
"
"An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
[p]never draw sword again.
"
"An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
[p]draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
[p]fools in hand?
"
"Sir, I have not you by the hand.
"
"Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
"
"Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
[p]your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
"
"Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?
"
"It's dry, sir.
"
"Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
[p]keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
"
"A dry jest, sir.
"
"Are you full of them?
"
"Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
[p]now I let go your hand, I am barren.
"
"O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
[p]see thee so put down?
"
"Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
[p]put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
[p]than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
[p]great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
"
"No question.
"
"An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
[p]to-morrow, Sir Toby.
"
"Pourquoi, my dear knight?
"
"What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
[p]bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
[p]fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
[p]followed the arts!
"
"Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
"
"Why, would that have mended my hair?
"
"Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
"
"But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
"
"Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
[p]hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
[p]and spin it off.
"
"Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
[p]will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
[p]she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
"
"She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
[p]her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
[p]have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
[p]man.
"
"I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
[p]strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
[p]and revels sometimes altogether.
"
"Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
"
"As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
[p]degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
[p]with an old man.
"
"What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
"
"Faith, I can cut a caper.
"
"And I can cut the mutton to't.
"
"And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
[p]as any man in Illyria.
"
"Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
[p]these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
[p]take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
[p]thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
[p]a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
[p]so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
[p]dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
[p]I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
[p]leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
"
"Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
[p]flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
"
"What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
"
"Taurus! That's sides and heart.
"
"No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the
[p]caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!
"
"If the duke continue these favours towards you,
[p]Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
[p]known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
"
"You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
[p]you call in question the continuance of his love:
[p]is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
"
"No, believe me.
"
"I thank you. Here comes the count.
"
"Who saw Cesario, ho?
"
"On your attendance, my lord; here.
"
"Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,
[p]Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
[p]To thee the book even of my secret soul:
[p]Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
[p]Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
[p]And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
[p]Till thou have audience.
"
"Sure, my noble lord,
[p]If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
[p]As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
"
"Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
[p]Rather than make unprofited return.
"
"Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
"
"O, then unfold the passion of my love,
[p]Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
[p]It shall become thee well to act my woes;
[p]She will attend it better in thy youth
[p]Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
"
"I think not so, my lord.
"
"Dear lad, believe it;
[p]For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
[p]That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
[p]Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
[p]Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
[p]And all is semblative a woman's part.
[p]I know thy constellation is right apt
[p]For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
[p]All, if you will; for I myself am best
[p]When least in company. Prosper well in this,
[p]And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
[p]To call his fortunes thine.
"
"I'll do my best
[p]To woo your lady:
[p][Aside]
[p]yet, a barful strife!
[p]Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
"
"Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
[p]not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
[p]way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
"
"Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
[p]world needs to fear no colours.
"
"Make that good.
"
"He shall see none to fear.
"
"A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
[p]saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'
"
"Where, good Mistress Mary?
"
"In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
"
"Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
[p]that are fools, let them use their talents.
"
"Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
[p]to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
"
"Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,
[p]for turning away, let summer bear it out.
"
"You are resolute, then?
"
"Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.
"
"That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both
[p]break, your gaskins fall.
"
"Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if
[p]Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
[p]piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
"
"Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my
[p]lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.
"
"Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
[p]Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
[p]prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
[p]pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
[p]'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
[p][Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO]
[p]God bless thee, lady!
"
"Take the fool away.
"
"Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
"
"Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
[p]besides, you grow dishonest.
"
"Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
[p]will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
[p]the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
[p]himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
[p]he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
[p]that's mended is but patched: virtue that
[p]transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
[p]amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
[p]simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
[p]what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
[p]calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
[p]away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.
"
"Sir, I bade them take away you.
"
"Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
[p]facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
[p]motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
[p]prove you a fool.
"
"Can you do it?
"
"Dexterously, good madonna.
"
"Make your proof.
"
"I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
[p]of virtue, answer me.
"
"Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.
"
"Good madonna, why mournest thou?
"
"Good fool, for my brother's death.
"
"I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
"
"I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
"
"The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
[p]soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
"
"What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
"
"Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:
[p]infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
[p]better fool.
"
"God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
[p]better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
[p]sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
[p]word for two pence that you are no fool.
"
"How say you to that, Malvolio?
"
"I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
[p]barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
[p]with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
[p]than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
[p]already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
[p]him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
[p]that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
[p]than the fools' zanies.
"
"Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
[p]with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
[p]guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
[p]things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
[p]there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
[p]nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
[p]man, though he do nothing but reprove.
"
"Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
[p]speakest well of fools!
"
"Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much
[p]desires to speak with you.
"
"From the Count Orsino, is it?
"
"I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
"
"Who of my people hold him in delay?
"
"Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
"
"Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but
[p]madman: fie on him!
[p][Exit MARIA]
[p]Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I
[p]am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
[p][Exit MALVOLIO]
[p]Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
[p]people dislike it.
"
"Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
[p]son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
[p]brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a
[p]most weak pia mater.
"
"By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?
"
"A gentleman.
"
"A gentleman! what gentleman?
"
"'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
[p]pickle-herring! How now, sot!
"
"Good Sir Toby!
"
"Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
"
"Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
"
"Ay, marry, what is he?
"
"Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give
[p]me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
"
"What's a drunken man like, fool?
"
"Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
[p]draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
[p]him; and a third drowns him.
"
"Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my
[p]coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's
[p]drowned: go, look after him.
"
"He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look
[p]to the madman.
"
"Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with
[p]you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
[p]understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
[p]with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
[p]have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
[p]comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
[p]lady? he's fortified against any denial.
"
"Tell him he shall not speak with me.
"
"Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your
[p]door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to
[p]a bench, but he'll speak with you.
"
"What kind o' man is he?
"
"Why, of mankind.
"
"What manner of man?
"
"Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
"
"Of what personage and years is he?
"
"Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
[p]a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a
[p]cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
[p]in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
[p]well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
[p]would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
"
"Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.
"
"Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
"
"Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
[p]We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
"
"The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
"
"Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
[p]Your will?
"
"Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
[p]pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
[p]for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
[p]my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
[p]penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
[p]beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
[p]comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
"
"Whence came you, sir?
"
"I can say little more than I have studied, and that
[p]question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
[p]modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
[p]that I may proceed in my speech.
"
"Are you a comedian?
"
"No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
[p]of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
[p]the lady of the house?
"
"If I do not usurp myself, I am.
"
"Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
[p]yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
[p]to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
[p]on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
[p]the heart of my message.
"
"Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
"
"Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
"
"It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
[p]keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
[p]and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
[p]than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
[p]you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of
[p]moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
"
"Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.
"
"No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
[p]longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
[p]lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
"
"Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
[p]the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
"
"It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
[p]war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
[p]hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.
"
"Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
"
"The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
[p]learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
[p]would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
[p]divinity, to any other's, profanation.
"
"Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
[p][Exeunt MARIA and Attendants]
[p]Now, sir, what is your text?
"
"Most sweet lady,--
"
"A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
[p]Where lies your text?
"
"In Orsino's bosom.
"
"In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
"
"To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
"
"O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
"
"Good madam, let me see your face.
"
"Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
[p]with my face? You are now out of your text: but
[p]we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
[p]Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
[p]not well done?
"
"Excellently done, if God did all.
"
"'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
"
"'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
[p]Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
[p]Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
[p]If you will lead these graces to the grave
[p]And leave the world no copy.
"
"O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
[p]out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
[p]inventoried, and every particle and utensil
[p]labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
[p]indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
[p]them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
[p]you sent hither to praise me?
"
"I see you what you are, you are too proud;
[p]But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
[p]My lord and master loves you: O, such love
[p]Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
[p]The nonpareil of beauty!
"
"How does he love me?
"
"With adorations, fertile tears,
[p]With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
"
"Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
[p]Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
[p]Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
[p]In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
[p]And in dimension and the shape of nature
[p]A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
[p]He might have took his answer long ago.
"
"If I did love you in my master's flame,
[p]With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
[p]In your denial I would find no sense;
[p]I would not understand it.
"
"Why, what would you?
"
"Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
[p]And call upon my soul within the house;
[p]Write loyal cantons of contemned love
[p]And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
[p]Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
[p]And make the babbling gossip of the air
[p]Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
[p]Between the elements of air and earth,
[p]But you should pity me!
"
"You might do much.
[p]What is your parentage?
"
"Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
[p]I am a gentleman.
"
"Get you to your lord;
[p]I cannot love him: let him send no more;
[p]Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
[p]To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
[p]I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
"
"I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
[p]My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
[p]Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
[p]And let your fervor, like my master's, be
[p]Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
"
"'What is your parentage?'
[p]'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
[p]I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;
[p]Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,
[p]Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
[p]soft, soft!
[p]Unless the master were the man. How now!
[p]Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
[p]Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
[p]With an invisible and subtle stealth
[p]To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
[p]What ho, Malvolio!
"
"Here, madam, at your service.
"
"Run after that same peevish messenger,
[p]The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
[p]Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
[p]Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
[p]Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:
[p]If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
[p]I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.
"
"Madam, I will.
"
"I do I know not what, and fear to find
[p]Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
[p]Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;
[p]What is decreed must be, and be this so.
"
"Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
"
"By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
[p]me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
[p]distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
[p]leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
[p]recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
"
"No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
[p]extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
[p]touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
[p]what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
[p]me in manners the rather to express myself. You
[p]must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
[p]which I called Roderigo. My father was that
[p]Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
[p]of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
[p]born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
[p]would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
[p]for some hour before you took me from the breach of
[p]the sea was my sister drowned.
"
"Alas the day!
"
"A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
[p]me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
[p]though I could not with such estimable wonder
[p]overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
[p]publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
[p]call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
[p]water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
"
"Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
"
"O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
"
"If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
[p]your servant.
"
"If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
[p]kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
[p]Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
[p]and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
[p]upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
[p]tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
"
"The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
[p]I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
[p]Else would I very shortly see thee there.
[p]But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
[p]That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
"
"Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
"
"Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since
[p]arrived but hither.
"
"She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
[p]saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
[p]She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
[p]into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
[p]and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
[p]come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
[p]your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
"
"She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
"
"Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
[p]will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
[p]stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be
[p]it his that finds it.
"
"I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
[p]Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
[p]She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
[p]That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
[p]For she did speak in starts distractedly.
[p]She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
[p]Invites me in this churlish messenger.
[p]None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
[p]I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
[p]Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
[p]Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
[p]Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
[p]How easy is it for the proper-false
[p]In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
[p]Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
[p]For such as we are made of, such we be.
[p]How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;
[p]And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
[p]And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
[p]What will become of this? As I am man,
[p]My state is desperate for my master's love;
[p]As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
[p]What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
[p]O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
[p]It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
"
"Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after
[p]midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo
[p]surgere,' thou know'st,--
"
"Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up
[p]late is to be up late.
"
"A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.
[p]To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is
[p]early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
[p]to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the
[p]four elements?
"
"Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists
[p]of eating and drinking.
"
"Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
[p]Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!
"
"Here comes the fool, i' faith.
"
"How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture
[p]of 'we three'?
"
"Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.
"
"By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I
[p]had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,
[p]and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In
[p]sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last
[p]night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the
[p]Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas
[p]very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy
[p]leman: hadst it?
"
"I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose
[p]is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the
[p]Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
"
"Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all
[p]is done. Now, a song.
"
"Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.
"
"There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--
"
"Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
"
"A love-song, a love-song.
"
"Ay, ay: I care not for good life.
"
"[Sings]
[p]O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
[p]O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
[p]That can sing both high and low:
[p]Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
[p]Journeys end in lovers meeting,
[p]Every wise man's son doth know.
"
"Excellent good, i' faith.
"
"Good, good.
"
"[Sings]
[p]What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
[p]Present mirth hath present laughter;
[p]What's to come is still unsure:
[p]In delay there lies no plenty;
[p]Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,
[p]Youth's a stuff will not endure.
"
"A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
"
"A contagious breath.
"
"Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
"
"To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
[p]But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we
[p]rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
[p]souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
"
"An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.
"
"By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
"
"Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'
"
"'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be
[p]constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.
"
"'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to
[p]call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'
"
"I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
"
"Good, i' faith. Come, begin.
"
"What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady
[p]have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him
[p]turn you out of doors, never trust me.
"
"My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's
[p]a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not
[p]I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?
[p]Tillyvally. Lady!
[p][Sings]
[p]'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'
"
"Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
"
"Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do
[p]I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it
[p]more natural.
"
"[Sings] 'O, the twelfth day of December,'--
"
"For the love o' God, peace!
"
"My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye
[p]no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like
[p]tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an
[p]alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your
[p]coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse
[p]of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
[p]time in you?
"
"We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
"
"Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me
[p]tell you, that, though she harbours you as her
[p]kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If
[p]you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you
[p]are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please
[p]you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid
[p]you farewell.
"
"'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'
"
"Nay, good Sir Toby.
"
"'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'
"
"Is't even so?
"
"'But I will never die.'
"
"Sir Toby, there you lie.
"
"This is much credit to you.
"
"'Shall I bid him go?'
"
"'What an if you do?'
"
"'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'
"
"'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'
"
"Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a
[p]steward? Dost thou think, because thou art
[p]virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
"
"Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the
[p]mouth too.
"
"Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with
[p]crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!
"
"Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any
[p]thing more than contempt, you would not give means
[p]for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.
"
"Go shake your ears.
"
"'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's
[p]a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to
[p]break promise with him and make a fool of him.
"
"Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll
[p]deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
"
"Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the
[p]youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is
[p]much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me
[p]alone with him: if I do not gull him into a
[p]nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
[p]think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:
[p]I know I can do it.
"
"Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.
"
"Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
"
"O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!
"
"What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,
[p]dear knight?
"
"I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason
[p]good enough.
"
"The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing
[p]constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,
[p]that cons state without book and utters it by great
[p]swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
[p]crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is
[p]his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
[p]him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find
[p]notable cause to work.
"
"What wilt thou do?
"
"I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
[p]love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
[p]of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
[p]of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
[p]himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
[p]like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
[p]can hardly make distinction of our hands.
"
"Excellent! I smell a device.
"
"I have't in my nose too.
"
"He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,
[p]that they come from my niece, and that she's in
[p]love with him.
"
"My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
"
"And your horse now would make him an ass.
"
"Ass, I doubt not.
"
"O, 'twill be admirable!
"
"Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will
[p]work with him. I will plant you two, and let the
[p]fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:
[p]observe his construction of it. For this night, to
[p]bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
"
"Good night, Penthesilea.
"
"Before me, she's a good wench.
"
"She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:
[p]what o' that?
"
"I was adored once too.
"
"Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for
[p]more money.
"
"If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
"
"Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'
[p]the end, call me cut.
"
"If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
"
"Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late
[p]to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.
"
"Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
[p]Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
[p]That old and antique song we heard last night:
[p]Methought it did relieve my passion much,
[p]More than light airs and recollected terms
[p]Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
[p]Come, but one verse.
"
"He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.
"
"Who was it?
"
"Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady
[p]Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.
"
"Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
[p][Exit CURIO. Music plays]
[p]Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
[p]In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
[p]For such as I am all true lovers are,
[p]Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
[p]Save in the constant image of the creature
[p]That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
"
"It gives a very echo to the seat
[p]Where Love is throned.
"
"Thou dost speak masterly:
[p]My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
[p]Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
[p]Hath it not, boy?
"
"A little, by your favour.
"
"What kind of woman is't?
"
"Of your complexion.
"
"She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
"
"About your years, my lord.
"
"Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
[p]An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
[p]So sways she level in her husband's heart:
[p]For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
[p]Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
[p]More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
[p]Than women's are.
"
"I think it well, my lord.
"
"Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
[p]Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
[p]For women are as roses, whose fair flower
[p]Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.
"
"And so they are: alas, that they are so;
[p]To die, even when they to perfection grow!
"
"O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
[p]Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
[p]The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
[p]And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
[p]Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
[p]And dallies with the innocence of love,
[p]Like the old age.
"
"Are you ready, sir?
"
"Ay; prithee, sing.
[p][Music]
[p]SONG.
"
"Come away, come away, death,
[p]And in sad cypress let me be laid;
[p]Fly away, fly away breath;
[p]I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
[p]My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
[p]O, prepare it!
[p]My part of death, no one so true
[p]Did share it.
[p]Not a flower, not a flower sweet
[p]On my black coffin let there be strown;
[p]Not a friend, not a friend greet
[p]My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
[p]A thousand thousand sighs to save,
[p]Lay me, O, where
[p]Sad true lover never find my grave,
[p]To weep there!
"
"There's for thy pains.
"
"No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.
"
"I'll pay thy pleasure then.
"
"Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
"
"Give me now leave to leave thee.
"
"Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
[p]tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
[p]thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
[p]constancy put to sea, that their business might be
[p]every thing and their intent every where; for that's
[p]it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
"
"Let all the rest give place.
[p][CURIO and Attendants retire]
[p]Once more, Cesario,
[p]Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
[p]Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
[p]Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
[p]The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
[p]Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
[p]But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
[p]That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
"
"But if she cannot love you, sir?
"
"I cannot be so answer'd.
"
"Sooth, but you must.
[p]Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
[p]Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
[p]As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
[p]You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?
"
"There is no woman's sides
[p]Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
[p]As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
[p]So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
[p]Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
[p]No motion of the liver, but the palate,
[p]That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
[p]But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
[p]And can digest as much: make no compare
[p]Between that love a woman can bear me
[p]And that I owe Olivia.
"
"Ay, but I know--
"
"What dost thou know?
"
"Too well what love women to men may owe:
[p]In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
[p]My father had a daughter loved a man,
[p]As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
[p]I should your lordship.
"
"And what's her history?
"
"A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
[p]But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
[p]Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
[p]And with a green and yellow melancholy
[p]She sat like patience on a monument,
[p]Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
[p]We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
[p]Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
[p]Much in our vows, but little in our love.
"
"But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
"
"I am all the daughters of my father's house,
[p]And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
[p]Sir, shall I to this lady?
"
"Ay, that's the theme.
[p]To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
[p]My love can give no place, bide no denay.
"
"Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
"
"Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,
[p]let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
"
"Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
[p]rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
"
"I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'
[p]favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
"
"To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will
[p]fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?
"
"An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
"
"Here comes the little villain.
[p][Enter MARIA]
[p]How now, my metal of India!
"
"Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
[p]coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
[p]sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
[p]hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
[p]know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
[p]him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,
[p][Throws down a letter]
[p]for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
"
"'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told
[p]me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
[p]thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one
[p]of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
[p]exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
[p]What should I think on't?
"
"Here's an overweening rogue!
"
"O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock
[p]of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
"
"'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
"
"Peace, I say.
"
"To be Count Malvolio!
"
"Ah, rogue!
"
"Pistol him, pistol him.
"
"Peace, peace!
"
"There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy
[p]married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
"
"Fie on him, Jezebel!
"
"O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how
[p]imagination blows him.
"
"Having been three months married to her, sitting in
[p]my state,--
"
"O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
"
"Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet
[p]gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left
[p]Olivia sleeping,--
"
"Fire and brimstone!
"
"O, peace, peace!
"
"And then to have the humour of state; and after a
[p]demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
[p]place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
[p]kinsman Toby,--
"
"Bolts and shackles!
"
"O peace, peace, peace! now, now.
"
"Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
[p]out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind
[p]up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
[p]approaches; courtesies there to me,--
"
"Shall this fellow live?
"
"Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
"
"I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar
[p]smile with an austere regard of control,--
"
"And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
"
"Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on
[p]your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--
"
"What, what?
"
"'You must amend your drunkenness.'
"
"Out, scab!
"
"Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
"
"'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with
[p]a foolish knight,'--
"
"That's me, I warrant you.
"
"'One Sir Andrew,'--
"
"I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
"
"What employment have we here?
"
"Now is the woodcock near the gin.
"
"O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading
[p]aloud to him!
"
"By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her
[p]very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her
[p]great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
"
"Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?
"
"[Reads] 'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
[p]wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
[p]Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she
[p]uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?
"
"This wins him, liver and all.
"
"[Reads]
[p]Jove knows I love: But who?
[p]Lips, do not move;
[p]No man must know.
[p]'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
[p]altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
[p]thee, Malvolio?
"
"Marry, hang thee, brock!
"
"[Reads]
[p]I may command where I adore;
[p]But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
[p]With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
[p]M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.
"
"A fustian riddle!
"
"Excellent wench, say I.
"
"'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let
[p]me see, let me see, let me see.
"
"What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
"
"And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!
"
"'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command
[p]me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is
[p]evident to any formal capacity; there is no
[p]obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
[p]that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
[p]that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,
[p]I,--
"
"O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.
"
"Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as
[p]rank as a fox.
"
"M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
"
"Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
[p]excellent at faults.
"
"M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;
[p]that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.
"
"And O shall end, I hope.
"
"Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!
"
"And then I comes behind.
"
"Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see
[p]more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
[p]you.
"
"M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
[p]yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
[p]every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
[p]here follows prose.
[p][Reads]
[p]'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
[p]am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
[p]are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
[p]have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
[p]their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
[p]and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
[p]cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
[p]opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
[p]thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
[p]the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
[p]that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy

[p]Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
[p]open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
[p]I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
[p]acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
[p]I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
[p]me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
[p]loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
[p]late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
[p]and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
[p]with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
[p]of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
[p]be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
[p]cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
[p]on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
[p]postscript.
[p][Reads]
[p]'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
[p]entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
[p]thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
[p]presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
[p]Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
[p]everything that thou wilt have me.
"
"I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
[p]of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
"
"I could marry this wench for this device.
"
"So could I too.
"
"And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
"
"Nor I neither.
"
"Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
"
"Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
"
"Or o' mine either?
"
"Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy
[p]bond-slave?
"
"I' faith, or I either?
"
"Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when
[p]the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
"
"Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
"
"Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
"
"If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark
[p]his first approach before my lady: he will come to
[p]her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she
[p]abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;
[p]and he will smile upon her, which will now be so
[p]unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
[p]melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him
[p]into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow
[p]me.
"
"To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
"
"I'll make one too.
"
"Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
[p]thy tabour?
"
"No, sir, I live by the church.
"
"Art thou a churchman?
"
"No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
[p]I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
[p]the church.
"
"So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a
[p]beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
[p]tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.
"
"You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
[p]but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
[p]wrong side may be turned outward!
"
"Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
[p]words may quickly make them wanton.
"
"I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
"
"Why, man?
"
"Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
[p]word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
[p]are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
"
"Thy reason, man?
"
"Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and
[p]words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
[p]reason with them.
"
"I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
"
"Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my
[p]conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
[p]to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
"
"Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
"
"No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
[p]will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
[p]fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
[p]herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
[p]her fool, but her corrupter of words.
"
"I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
"
"Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
[p]it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
[p]the fool should be as oft with your master as with
[p]my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
"
"Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
[p]Hold, there's expenses for thee.
"
"Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
"
"By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
[p]one;
[p][Aside]
[p]though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
[p]lady within?
"
"Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
"
"Yes, being kept together and put to use.
"
"I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring
[p]a Cressida to this Troilus.
"
"I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.
"
"The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but
[p]a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
[p]within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
[p]come; who you are and what you would are out of my
[p]welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.
"
"This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
[p]And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
[p]He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
[p]The quality of persons, and the time,
[p]And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
[p]That comes before his eye. This is a practise
[p]As full of labour as a wise man's art
[p]For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
[p]But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
"
"Save you, gentleman.
"
"And you, sir.
"
"Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
"
"Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.
"
"I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.
"
"Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
[p]you should enter, if your trade be to her.
"
"I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
[p]list of my voyage.
"
"Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
"
"My legs do better understand me, sir, than I
[p]understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
"
"I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
"
"I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
[p]are prevented.
[p][Enter OLIVIA and MARIA]
[p]Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
[p]odours on you!
"
"That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.
"
"My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant
[p]and vouchsafed ear.
"
"'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em
[p]all three all ready.
"
"Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
[p][Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA]
[p]Give me your hand, sir.
"
"My duty, madam, and most humble service.
"
"What is your name?
"
"Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
"
"My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
[p]Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
[p]You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
"
"And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
[p]Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
"
"For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
[p]Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!
"
"Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
[p]On his behalf.
"
"O, by your leave, I pray you,
[p]I bade you never speak again of him:
[p]But, would you undertake another suit,
[p]I had rather hear you to solicit that
[p]Than music from the spheres.
"
"Dear lady,--
"
"Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
[p]After the last enchantment you did here,
[p]A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
[p]Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:
[p]Under your hard construction must I sit,To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
[p]Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
[p]Have you not set mine honour at the stake
[p]And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
[p]That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
[p]Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
[p]Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
"
"I pity you.
"
"That's a degree to love.
"
"No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,
[p]That very oft we pity enemies.
"
"Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
[p]O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
[p]If one should be a prey, how much the better
[p]To fall before the lion than the wolf!
[p][Clock strikes]
[p]The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
[p]Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
[p]And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
[p]Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
[p]There lies your way, due west.
"
"Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
[p]Attend your ladyship!
[p]You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
"
"Stay:
[p]I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
"
"That you do think you are not what you are.
"
"If I think so, I think the same of you.
"
"Then think you right: I am not what I am.
"
"I would you were as I would have you be!
"
"Would it be better, madam, than I am?
[p]I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
"
"O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
[p]In the contempt and anger of his lip!
[p]A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
[p]Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
[p]Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
[p]By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
[p]I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
[p]Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
[p]Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
[p]For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
[p]But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
[p]Love sought is good, but given unsought better.
"
"By innocence I swear, and by my youth
[p]I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,
[p]And that no woman has; nor never none
[p]Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
[p]And so adieu, good madam: never more
[p]Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
"
"Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
[p]That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
"
"No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
"
"Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
"
"You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
"
"Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the
[p]count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;
[p]I saw't i' the orchard.
"
"Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
"
"As plain as I see you now.
"
"This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
"
"'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
"
"I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
[p]judgment and reason.
"
"And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah
[p]was a sailor.
"
"She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
[p]to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
[p]put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
[p]You should then have accosted her; and with some
[p]excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
[p]have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
[p]looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
[p]double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
[p]off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
[p]lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle
[p]on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by
[p]some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
"
"An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy
[p]I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
[p]politician.
"
"Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
[p]valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
[p]with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
[p]take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no
[p]love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
[p]commendation with woman than report of valour.
"
"There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
"
"Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
"
"Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;
[p]it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
[p]of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
[p]if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be
[p]amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
[p]paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
[p]bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.
[p]Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
[p]write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.
"
"Where shall I find you?
"
"We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.
"
"This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
"
"I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand
[p]strong, or so.
"
"We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
[p]not deliver't?
"
"Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the
[p]youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
[p]cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
[p]opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
[p]will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of
[p]the anatomy.
"
"And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no
[p]great presage of cruelty.
"
"Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.
"
"If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself
[p]into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is
[p]turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no
[p]Christian, that means to be saved by believing
[p]rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages
[p]of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.
"
"And cross-gartered?
"
"Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school
[p]i' the church. I have dogged him, like his
[p]murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
[p]that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
[p]face into more lines than is in the new map with the
[p]augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
[p]a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
[p]at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,
[p]he'll smile and take't for a great favour.
"
"Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
"
"I would not by my will have troubled you;
[p]But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
[p]I will no further chide you.
"
"I could not stay behind you: my desire,
[p]More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
[p]And not all love to see you, though so much
[p]As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
[p]But jealousy what might befall your travel,
[p]Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
[p]Unguided and unfriended, often prove
[p]Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
[p]The rather by these arguments of fear,
[p]Set forth in your pursuit.
"
"My kind Antonio,
[p]I can no other answer make but thanks,
[p]And thanks; and ever thanks; and oft good turns
[p]Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
[p]But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
[p]You should find better dealing. What's to do?
[p]Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
"
"To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.
"
"I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:
[p]I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
[p]With the memorials and the things of fame
[p]That do renown this city.
"
"Would you'ld pardon me;
[p]I do not without danger walk these streets:
[p]Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
[p]I did some service; of such note indeed,
[p]That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
"
"Belike you slew great number of his people.
"
"The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
[p]Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
[p]Might well have given us bloody argument.
[p]It might have since been answer'd in repaying
[p]What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
[p]Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
[p]For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
[p]I shall pay dear.
"
"Do not then walk too open.
"
"It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.
[p]In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
[p]Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
[p]Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
[p]With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
"
"Why I your purse?
"
"Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
[p]You have desire to purchase; and your store,
[p]I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
"
"I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you
[p]For an hour.
"
"To the Elephant.
"
"I do remember.
"
"I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
[p]How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
[p]For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
[p]I speak too loud.
[p]Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,
[p]And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
[p]Where is Malvolio?
"
"He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He
[p]is, sure, possessed, madam.
"
"Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
"
"No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
[p]ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if
[p]he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.
"
"Go call him hither.
[p][Exit MARIA]
[p]I am as mad as he,
[p]If sad and merry madness equal be.
[p][Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO]
[p]How now, Malvolio!
"
"Sweet lady, ho, ho.
"
"Smilest thou?
[p]I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
"
"Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
[p]obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but
[p]what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is
[p]with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and
[p]please all.'
"
"Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
"
"Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It
[p]did come to his hands, and commands shall be
[p]executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
"
"Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
"
"To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.
"
"God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
[p]thy hand so oft?
"
"How do you, Malvolio?
"
"At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.
"
"Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
"
"'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
"
"What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
"
"'Some are born great,'--
"
"Ha!
"
"'Some achieve greatness,'--
"
"What sayest thou?
"
"'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
"
"Heaven restore thee!
"
"'Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,'--
"
"Thy yellow stockings!
"
"'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
"
"Cross-gartered!
"
"'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--
"
"Am I made?
"
"'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'
"
"Why, this is very midsummer madness.
"
"Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is
[p]returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
[p]attends your ladyship's pleasure.
"
"I'll come to him.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p]Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's
[p]my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
[p]care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
[p]half of my dowry.
"
"O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
[p]Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
[p]the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
[p]appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that
[p]in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
[p]'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
[p]let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
[p]thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
[p]consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
[p]face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
[p]habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
[p]limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
[p]thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
[p]fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
[p]after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
[p]adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
[p]scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
[p]or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
[p]that can be can come between me and the full
[p]prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
[p]doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
"
"Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all
[p]the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion
[p]himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.
"
"Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?
[p]how is't with you, man?
"
"Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go
[p]off.
"
"Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not
[p]I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a
[p]care of him.
"
"Ah, ha! does she so?
"
"Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently
[p]with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how
[p]is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
[p]consider, he's an enemy to mankind.
"
"Do you know what you say?
"
"La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes
[p]it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
"
"Carry his water to the wise woman.
"
"Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I
[p]live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
"
"How now, mistress!
"
"O Lord!
"
"Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do
[p]you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
"
"No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is
[p]rough, and will not be roughly used.
"
"Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?
"
"Sir!
"
"Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for
[p]gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
[p]him, foul collier!
"
"Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
"
"My prayers, minx!
"
"No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
"
"Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow
[p]things: I am not of your element: you shall know
[p]more hereafter.
"
"Is't possible?
"
"If this were played upon a stage now, I could
[p]condemn it as an improbable fiction.
"
"His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
"
"Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
"
"Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
"
"The house will be the quieter.
"
"Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My
[p]niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we
[p]may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,
[p]till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt
[p]us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
[p]bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
[p]finder of madmen. But see, but see.
"
"More matter for a May morning.
"
"Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
[p]vinegar and pepper in't.
"
"Is't so saucy?
"
"Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.
"
"Give me.
[p][Reads]
[p]'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'
"
"Good, and valiant.
"
"[Reads] 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,
[p]why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'
"
"A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.
"
"[Reads] 'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my
[p]sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy
[p]throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'
"
"Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.
"
"[Reads] 'I will waylay thee going home; where if it
[p]be thy chance to kill me,'--
"
"Good.
"
"[Reads] 'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'
"
"Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.
"
"[Reads] 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon
[p]one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but
[p]my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy
[p]friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,
[p]ANDREW AGUECHEEK.
[p]If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:
[p]I'll give't him.
"
"You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
[p]some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
"
"Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the
[p]orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
[p]him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for
[p]it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a
[p]swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood
[p]more approbation than ever proof itself would have
[p]earned him. Away!
"
"Nay, let me alone for swearing.
"
"Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior
[p]of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
[p]capacity and breeding; his employment between his
[p]lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
[p]letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no
[p]terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
[p]clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
[p]word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report
[p]of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his
[p]youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous
[p]opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.
[p]This will so fright them both that they will kill
[p]one another by the look, like cockatrices.
"
"Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
[p]he take leave, and presently after him.
"
"I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
[p]for a challenge.
"
"I have said too much unto a heart of stone
[p]And laid mine honour too unchary out:
[p]There's something in me that reproves my fault;
[p]But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
[p]That it but mocks reproof.
"
"With the same 'havior that your passion bears
[p]Goes on my master's grief.
"
"Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
[p]Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
[p]And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
[p]What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
[p]That honour saved may upon asking give?
"
"Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
"
"How with mine honour may I give him that
[p]Which I have given to you?
"
"I will acquit you.
"
"Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
[p]A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
"
"Gentleman, God save thee.
"
"And you, sir.
"
"That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what
[p]nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
[p]not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
[p]the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
[p]dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
[p]thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
"
"You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel
[p]to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
[p]any image of offence done to any man.
"
"You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,
[p]if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
[p]your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
[p]youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.
"
"I pray you, sir, what is he?
"
"He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
[p]carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
[p]brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
[p]his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
[p]that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
[p]and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.
"
"I will return again into the house and desire some
[p]conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
[p]of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
[p]others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
[p]of that quirk.
"
"Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a
[p]very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
[p]give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
[p]house, unless you undertake that with me which with
[p]as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
[p]or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
[p]must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
"
"This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
[p]this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
[p]my offence to him is: it is something of my
[p]negligence, nothing of my purpose.
"
"I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
[p]gentleman till my return.
"
"Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
"
"I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
[p]mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
"
"I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
"
"Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
[p]his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
[p]of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
[p]bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
[p]have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
[p]towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
[p]can.
"
"I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
[p]had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
[p]care not who knows so much of my mettle.
"
"Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
[p]firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
[p]all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
[p]motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
[p]pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
[p]step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
"
"Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
"
"Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
[p]scarce hold him yonder.
"
"Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
[p]cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld
[p]have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
[p]and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
"
"I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
[p]on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
[p][Aside]
[p]Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
[p][Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA]
[p][To FABIAN]
[p]I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
[p]I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
"
"He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
[p]looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
"
"[To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
[p]with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better
[p]bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
[p]scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
[p]the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
"
"[Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would
[p]make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
"
"Give ground, if you see him furious.
"
"Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
[p]will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
[p]he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
[p]promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
[p]will not hurt you. Come on; to't.
"
"Pray God, he keep his oath!
"
"I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
"
"Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
[p]Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
[p]If you offend him, I for him defy you.
"
"You, sir! why, what are you?
"
"One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
[p]Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
"
"Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
"
"O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.
"
"I'll be with you anon.
"
"Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
"
"Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,
[p]I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
[p]and reins well.
"
"This is the man; do thy office.
"
"Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
"
"You do mistake me, sir.
"
"No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
[p]Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
[p]Take him away: he knows I know him well.
"
"I must obey.
[p][To VIOLA]
[p]This comes with seeking you:
[p]But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
[p]What will you do, now my necessity
[p]Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
[p]Much more for what I cannot do for you
[p]Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
[p]But be of comfort.
"
"Come, sir, away.
"
"I must entreat of you some of that money.
"
"What money, sir?
[p]For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
[p]And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
[p]Out of my lean and low ability
[p]I'll lend you something: my having is not much;
[p]I'll make division of my present with you:
[p]Hold, there's half my coffer.
"
"Will you deny me now?
[p]Is't possible that my deserts to you
[p]Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
[p]Lest that it make me so unsound a man
[p]As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
[p]That I have done for you.
"
"I know of none;
[p]Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
[p]I hate ingratitude more in a man
[p]Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
[p]Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
[p]Inhabits our frail blood.
"
"O heavens themselves!
"
"Come, sir, I pray you, go.
"
"Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
[p]I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
[p]Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
[p]And to his image, which methought did promise
[p]Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
"
"What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
"
"But O how vile an idol proves this god
[p]Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
[p]In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
[p]None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
[p]Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
[p]Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
"
"The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.
"
"Lead me on.
"
"Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
[p]That he believes himself: so do not I.
[p]Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
[p]That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
"
"Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll
[p]whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
"
"He named Sebastian: I my brother know
[p]Yet living in my glass; even such and so
[p]In favour was my brother, and he went
[p]Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
[p]For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
[p]Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
"
"A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than
[p]a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his
[p]friend here in necessity and denying him; and for
[p]his cowardship, ask Fabian.
"
"A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
"
"'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
"
"Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
"
"An I do not,--
"
"Come, let's see the event.
"
"I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.
"
"Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
"
"Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:
[p]Let me be clear of thee.
"
"Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor
[p]I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come
[p]speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;
[p]nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
"
"I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou
[p]know'st not me.
"
"Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some
[p]great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my
[p]folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,
[p]will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy
[p]strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
[p]lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
"
"I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's
[p]money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give
[p]worse payment.
"
"By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men
[p]that give fools money get themselves a good
[p]report--after fourteen years' purchase.
"
"Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.
"
"Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all
[p]the people mad?
"
"Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.
"
"This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be
[p]in some of your coats for two pence.
"
"Come on, sir; hold.
"
"Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work
[p]with him; I'll have an action of battery against
[p]him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I
[p]struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.
"
"Let go thy hand.
"
"Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young
[p]soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.
"
"I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If
[p]thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.
"
"What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two
[p]of this malapert blood from you.
"
"Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!
"
"Madam!
"
"Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
[p]Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
[p]Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!
[p]Be not offended, dear Cesario.
[p]Rudesby, be gone!
[p][Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN]
[p]I prithee, gentle friend,
[p]Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
[p]In this uncivil and thou unjust extent
[p]Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
[p]And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
[p]This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby
[p]Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:
[p]Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
[p]He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
"
"What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
[p]Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
[p]Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
[p]If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
"
"Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!
"
"Madam, I will.
"
"O, say so, and so be!
"
"Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;
[p]make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do
[p]it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.
"
"Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself
[p]in't; and I would I were the first that ever
[p]dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to
[p]become the function well, nor lean enough to be
[p]thought a good student; but to be said an honest man
[p]and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a
[p]careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.
"
"Jove bless thee, master Parson.
"
"Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of
[p]Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily
[p]said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is;'
[p]so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for,
[p]what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?
"
"To him, Sir Topas.
"
"What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!
"
"The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.
"
"[Within] Who calls there?
"
"Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio
[p]the lunatic.
"
"Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.
"
"Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!
[p]talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
"
"Well said, Master Parson.
"
"Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir
[p]Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me
[p]here in hideous darkness.
"
"Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most
[p]modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones
[p]that will use the devil himself with courtesy:
[p]sayest thou that house is dark?
"
"As hell, Sir Topas.
"
"Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,
[p]and the clearstores toward the south north are as
[p]lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of
[p]obstruction?
"
"I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.
"
"Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness
[p]but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than
[p]the Egyptians in their fog.
"
"I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though
[p]ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there
[p]was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you
[p]are: make the trial of it in any constant question.
"
"What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?
"
"That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
"
"What thinkest thou of his opinion?
"
"I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
"
"Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:
[p]thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
[p]allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest
[p]thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
"
"Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
"
"My most exquisite Sir Topas!
"
"Nay, I am for all waters.
"
"Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
[p]gown: he sees thee not.
"
"To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how
[p]thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this
[p]knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I
[p]would he were, for I am now so far in offence with
[p]my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this
[p]sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.
"
"[Singing]
[p]'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
[p]Tell me how thy lady does.'
"
"Fool!
"
"'My lady is unkind, perdy.'
"
"Fool!
"
"'Alas, why is she so?'
"
"Fool, I say!
"
"'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?
"
"Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my
[p]hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:
[p]as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to
[p]thee for't.
"
"Master Malvolio?
"
"Ay, good fool.
"
"Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
"
"Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I
[p]am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
"
"But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no
[p]better in your wits than a fool.
"
"They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,
[p]send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to
[p]face me out of my wits.
"
"Advise you what you say; the minister is here.
[p]Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!
[p]endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain
[p]bibble babble.
"
"Sir Topas!
"
"Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,
[p]sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.
[p]Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.
"
"Fool, fool, fool, I say!
"
"Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am
[p]shent for speaking to you.
"
"Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I
[p]tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
"
"Well-a-day that you were, sir
"
"By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and
[p]light; and convey what I will set down to my lady:
[p]it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
[p]of letter did.
"
"I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you
[p]not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?
"
"Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.
"
"Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his
[p]brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.
"
"Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I
[p]prithee, be gone.
"
"[Singing]
[p]I am gone, sir,
[p]And anon, sir,
[p]I'll be with you again,
[p]In a trice,
[p]Like to the old Vice,
[p]Your need to sustain;
[p]Who, with dagger of lath,
[p]In his rage and his wrath,
[p]Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:
[p]Like a mad lad,
[p]Pare thy nails, dad;
[p]Adieu, good man devil.
"
"This is the air; that is the glorious sun;
[p]This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;
[p]And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
[p]Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?
[p]I could not find him at the Elephant:
[p]Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,
[p]That he did range the town to seek me out.
[p]His counsel now might do me golden service;
[p]For though my soul disputes well with my sense,
[p]That this may be some error, but no madness,
[p]Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
[p]So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
[p]That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
[p]And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
[p]To any other trust but that I am mad
[p]Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,
[p]She could not sway her house, command her followers,
[p]Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
[p]With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing
[p]As I perceive she does: there's something in't
[p]That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.
"
"Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
[p]Now go with me and with this holy man
[p]Into the chantry by: there, before him,
[p]And underneath that consecrated roof,
[p]Plight me the full assurance of your faith;
[p]That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
[p]May live at peace. He shall conceal it
[p]Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
[p]What time we will our celebration keep
[p]According to my birth. What do you say?
"
"I'll follow this good man, and go with you;
[p]And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
"
"Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,
[p]That they may fairly note this act of mine!
"
"Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
"
"Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
"
"Any thing.
"
"Do not desire to see this letter.
"
"This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my
[p]dog again.
"
"Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
"
"Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.
"
"I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?
"
"Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
[p]for my friends.
"
"Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.
"
"No, sir, the worse.
"
"How can that be?
"
"Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;
[p]now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
[p]my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,
[p]and by my friends, I am abused: so that,
[p]conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives
[p]make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for
[p]my friends and the better for my foes.
"
"Why, this is excellent.
"
"By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be
[p]one of my friends.
"
"Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
"
"But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would
[p]you could make it another.
"
"O, you give me ill counsel.
"
"Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,
[p]and let your flesh and blood obey it.
"
"Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
[p]double-dealer: there's another.
"
"Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old
[p]saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,
[p]sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of
[p]Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.
"
"You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
[p]if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
[p]with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake
[p]my bounty further.
"
"Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
[p]again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think
[p]that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
[p]but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I
[p]will awake it anon.
"
"Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
"
"That face of his I do remember well;
[p]Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
[p]As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
[p]A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
[p]For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
[p]With which such scathful grapple did he make
[p]With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
[p]That very envy and the tongue of loss
[p]Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
"
"Orsino, this is that Antonio
[p]That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
[p]And this is he that did the Tiger board,
[p]When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
[p]Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
[p]In private brabble did we apprehend him.
"
"He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
[p]But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
[p]I know not what 'twas but distraction.
"
"Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
[p]What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
[p]Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
[p]Hast made thine enemies?
"
"Orsino, noble sir,
[p]Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
[p]Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
[p]Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
[p]Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
[p]That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
[p]From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
[p]Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
[p]His life I gave him and did thereto add
[p]My love, without retention or restraint,
[p]All his in dedication; for his sake
[p]Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
[p]Into the danger of this adverse town;
[p]Drew to defend him when he was beset:
[p]Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
[p]Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
[p]Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
[p]And grew a twenty years removed thing
[p]While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
[p]Which I had recommended to his use
[p]Not half an hour before.
"
"How can this be?
"
"When came he to this town?
"
"To-day, my lord; and for three months before,
[p]No interim, not a minute's vacancy,
[p]Both day and night did we keep company.
"
"Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
[p]But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:
[p]Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
[p]But more of that anon. Take him aside.
"
"What would my lord, but that he may not have,
[p]Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
[p]Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
"
"Madam!
"
"Gracious Olivia,--
"
"What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--
"
"My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
"
"If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
[p]It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
[p]As howling after music.
"
"Still so cruel?
"
"Still so constant, lord.
"
"What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
[p]To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
[p]My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
[p]That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
"
"Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
"
"Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
[p]Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
[p]Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
[p]That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
[p]Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
[p]And that I partly know the instrument
[p]That screws me from my true place in your favour,
[p]Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
[p]But this your minion, whom I know you love,
[p]And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
[p]Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
[p]Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
[p]Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
[p]I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
[p]To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
"
"And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
[p]To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
"
"Where goes Cesario?
"
"After him I love
[p]More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
[p]More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
[p]If I do feign, you witnesses above
[p]Punish my life for tainting of my love!
"
"Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
"
"Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
"
"Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
[p]Call forth the holy father.
"
"Come, away!
"
"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
"
"Husband!
"
"Ay, husband: can he that deny?
"
"Her husband, sirrah!
"
"No, my lord, not I.
"
"Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
[p]That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
[p]Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
[p]Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
[p]As great as that thou fear'st.
[p][Enter Priest]
[p]O, welcome, father!
[p]Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
[p]Here to unfold, though lately we intended
[p]To keep in darkness what occasion now
[p]Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
[p]Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
"
"A contract of eternal bond of love,
[p]Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
[p]Attested by the holy close of lips,
[p]Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
[p]And all the ceremony of this compact
[p]Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
[p]Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
[p]I have travell'd but two hours.
"
"O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
[p]When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
[p]Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
[p]That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
[p]Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
[p]Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
"
"My lord, I do protest--
"
"O, do not swear!
[p]Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
"
"For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
[p]to Sir Toby.
"
"What's the matter?
"
"He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
[p]a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
[p]help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
"
"Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
"
"The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
[p]a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
"
"My gentleman, Cesario?
"
"'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
[p]nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
[p]by Sir Toby.
"
"Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
[p]You drew your sword upon me without cause;
[p]But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.
"
"If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
[p]think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
[p][Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown]
[p]Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
[p]but if he had not been in drink, he would have
[p]tickled you othergates than he did.
"
"How now, gentleman! how is't with you?
"
"That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
[p]on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
"
"O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
[p]were set at eight i' the morning.
"
"Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
[p]hate a drunken rogue.
"
"Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
"
"I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.
"
"Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
[p]knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
"
"Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
"
"I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
[p]But, had it been the brother of my blood,
[p]I must have done no less with wit and safety.
[p]You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
[p]I do perceive it hath offended you:
[p]Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
[p]We made each other but so late ago.
"
"One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
[p]A natural perspective, that is and is not!
"
"Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
[p]How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
[p]Since I have lost thee!
"
"Sebastian are you?
"
"Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
"
"How have you made division of yourself?
[p]An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
[p]Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
"
"Most wonderful!
"
"Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
[p]Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
[p]Of here and every where. I had a sister,
[p]Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
[p]Of charity, what kin are you to me?
[p]What countryman? what name? what parentage?
"
"Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
[p]Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
[p]So went he suited to his watery tomb:
[p]If spirits can assume both form and suit
[p]You come to fright us.
"
"A spirit I am indeed;
[p]But am in that dimension grossly clad
[p]Which from the womb I did participate.
[p]Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
[p]I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
[p]And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'
"
"My father had a mole upon his brow.
"
"And so had mine.
"
"And died that day when Viola from her birth
[p]Had number'd thirteen years.
"
"O, that record is lively in my soul!
[p]He finished indeed his mortal act
[p]That day that made my sister thirteen years.
"
"If nothing lets to make us happy both
[p]But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
[p]Do not embrace me till each circumstance
[p]Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
[p]That I am Viola: which to confirm,
[p]I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
[p]Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
[p]I was preserved to serve this noble count.
[p]All the occurrence of my fortune since
[p]Hath been between this lady and this lord.
"
"[To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
[p]But nature to her bias drew in that.
[p]You would have been contracted to a maid;
[p]Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
[p]You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
"
"Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
[p]If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
[p]I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
[p][To VIOLA]
[p]Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
[p]Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
"
"And all those sayings will I overswear;
[p]And those swearings keep as true in soul
[p]As doth that orbed continent the fire
[p]That severs day from night.
"
"Give me thy hand;
[p]And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
"
"The captain that did bring me first on shore
[p]Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
[p]Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
[p]A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
"
"He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
[p]And yet, alas, now I remember me,
[p]They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
[p][Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN]
[p]A most extracting frenzy of mine own
[p]From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
[p]How does he, sirrah?
"
"Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
[p]well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
[p]letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
[p]morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
[p]so it skills not much when they are delivered.
"
"Open't, and read it.
"
"Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
[p]the madman.
[p][Reads]
[p]'By the Lord, madam,'--
"
"How now! art thou mad?
"
"No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
[p]will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
"
"Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
"
"So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
[p]read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
"
"Read it you, sirrah.
"
"[Reads] 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
[p]world shall know it: though you have put me into
[p]darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
[p]me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
[p]your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
[p]me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
[p]not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
[p]Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
[p]unthought of and speak out of my injury.
[p]THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
"
"Did he write this?
"
"Ay, madam.
"
"This savours not much of distraction.
"
"See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
[p][Exit FABIAN]
[p]My lord so please you, these things further
[p]thought on,
[p]To think me as well a sister as a wife,
[p]One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
[p]Here at my house and at my proper cost.
"
"Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
[p][To VIOLA]
[p]Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
[p]So much against the mettle of your sex,
[p]So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
[p]And since you call'd me master for so long,
[p]Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
[p]Your master's mistress.
"
"A sister! you are she.
"
"Is this the madman?
"
"Ay, my lord, this same.
[p]How now, Malvolio!
"
"Madam, you have done me wrong,
[p]Notorious wrong.
"
"Have I, Malvolio? no.
"
"Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
[p]You must not now deny it is your hand:
[p]Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
[p]Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
[p]You can say none of this: well, grant it then
[p]And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
[p]Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
[p]Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
[p]To put on yellow stockings and to frown
[p]Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
[p]And, acting this in an obedient hope,
[p]Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
[p]Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
[p]And made the most notorious geck and gull
[p]That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
"
"Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
[p]Though, I confess, much like the character
[p]But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
[p]And now I do bethink me, it was she
[p]First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
[p]And in such forms which here were presupposed
[p]Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
[p]This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
[p]But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
[p]Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
[p]Of thine own cause.
"
"Good madam, hear me speak,
[p]And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
[p]Taint the condition of this present hour,
[p]Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
[p]Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
[p]Set this device against Malvolio here,
[p]Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
[p]We had conceived against him: Maria writ
[p]The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
[p]In recompense whereof he hath married her.
[p]How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
[p]May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
[p]If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
[p]That have on both sides pass'd.
"
"Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
"
"Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
[p]and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
[p]one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
[p]that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
[p]But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
[p]a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
[p]and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
"
"I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
"
"He hath been most notoriously abused.
"
"Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
[p]He hath not told us of the captain yet:
[p]When that is known and golden time convents,
[p]A solemn combination shall be made
[p]Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
[p]We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
[p]For so you shall be, while you are a man;
[p]But when in other habits you are seen,
[p]Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
"
"[Sings]
[p]When that I was and a little tiny boy,
[p]With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
[p]A foolish thing was but a toy,
[p]For the rain it raineth every day.
[p]But when I came to man's estate,
[p]With hey, ho, &c.
[p]'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
[p]For the rain, &c.
[p]But when I came, alas! to wive,
[p]With hey, ho, &c.
[p]By swaggering could I never thrive,
[p]For the rain, &c.
[p]But when I came unto my beds,
[p]With hey, ho, &c.
[p]With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
[p]For the rain, &c.
[p]A great while ago the world begun,
[p]With hey, ho, &c.
[p]But that's all one, our play is done,
[p]And we'll strive to please you every day.
"
"Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
[p]Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
[p]Were't not affection chains thy tender days
[p]To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
[p]I rather would entreat thy company
[p]To see the wonders of the world abroad,
[p]Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
[p]Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
[p]But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
[p]Even as I would when I to love begin.
"
"Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
[p]Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
[p]Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
[p]Wish me partaker in thy happiness
[p]When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
[p]If ever danger do environ thee,
[p]Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
[p]For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
"
"And on a love-book pray for my success?
"
"Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
"
"That's on some shallow story of deep love:
[p]How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
"
"That's a deep story of a deeper love:
[p]For he was more than over shoes in love.
"
"'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
[p]And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
"
"Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
"
"No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
"
"What?
"
"To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
[p]Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
[p]With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
[p]If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
[p]If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
[p]However, but a folly bought with wit,
[p]Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
"
"So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
"
"So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
"
"'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
"
"Love is your master, for he masters you:
[p]And he that is so yoked by a fool,
[p]Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
"
"Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
[p]The eating canker dwells, so eating love
[p]Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
"
"And writers say, as the most forward bud
[p]Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
[p]Even so by love the young and tender wit
[p]Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
[p]Losing his verdure even in the prime
[p]And all the fair effects of future hopes.
[p]But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
[p]That art a votary to fond desire?
[p]Once more adieu! my father at the road
[p]Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
"
"And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
"
"Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
[p]To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
[p]Of thy success in love, and what news else
[p]Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
[p]And likewise will visit thee with mine.
"
"All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
"
"As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
"
"He after honour hunts, I after love:
[p]He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
[p]I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
[p]Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
[p]Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
[p]War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
[p]Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
"
"Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
"
"But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.
"
"Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
[p]And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
"
"Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
[p]An if the shepherd be a while away.
"
"You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
[p]and I a sheep?
"
"I do.
"
"Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
"
"A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
"
"This proves me still a sheep.
"
"True; and thy master a shepherd.
"
"Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
"
"It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
"
"The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
[p]shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
[p]not me: therefore I am no sheep.
"
"The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
[p]shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
[p]wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
[p]follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
"
"Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
"
"But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?
"
"Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
[p]a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
[p]lost mutton, nothing for my labour.
"
"Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
"
"If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
"
"Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.
"
"Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
[p]carrying your letter.
"
"You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.
"
"From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
[p]'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
[p]your lover.
"
"But what said she?
"
"[First nodding] Ay.
"
"Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.
"
"You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
[p]me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'
"
"And that set together is noddy.
"
"Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
[p]take it for your pains.
"
"No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
"
"Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
"
"Why sir, how do you bear with me?
"
"Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
[p]but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
"
"Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
"
"And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
"
"Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
"
"Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
[p]be both at once delivered.
"
"Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
"
"Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
"
"Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
"
"Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,
[p]not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
[p]and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
[p]fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
[p]mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
[p]hard as steel.
"
"What said she? nothing?
"
"No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
[p]testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
[p]me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
[p]letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.
"
"Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
[p]Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
[p]Being destined to a drier death on shore.
[p][Exit SPEED]
[p]I must go send some better messenger:
[p]I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
[p]Receiving them from such a worthless post.
"
"But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
[p]Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
"
"Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
"
"Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
[p]That every day with parle encounter me,
[p]In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
"
"Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
[p]According to my shallow simple skill.
"
"What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
"
"As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
[p]But, were I you, he never should be mine.
"
"What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
"
"Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
"
"What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
"
"Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
"
"How now! what means this passion at his name?
"
"Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
[p]That I, unworthy body as I am,
[p]Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
"
"Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
"
"Then thus: of many good I think him best.
"
"Your reason?
"
"I have no other, but a woman's reason;
[p]I think him so because I think him so.
"
"And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
"
"Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
"
"Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.
"
"Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
"
"His little speaking shows his love but small.
"
"Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
"
"They do not love that do not show their love.
"
"O, they love least that let men know their love.
"
"I would I knew his mind.
"
"Peruse this paper, madam.
"
"'To Julia.' Say, from whom?
"
"That the contents will show.
"
"Say, say, who gave it thee?
"
"Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
[p]He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
[p]Did in your name receive it: pardon the
[p]fault I pray.
"
"Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
[p]Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
[p]To whisper and conspire against my youth?
[p]Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
[p]And you an officer fit for the place.
[p]Or else return no more into my sight.
"
"To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
"
"Will ye be gone?
"
"That you may ruminate.
"
"And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
[p]It were a shame to call her back again
[p]And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
[p]What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
[p]And would not force the letter to my view!
[p]Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
[p]Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
[p]Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
[p]That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
[p]And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
[p]How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
[p]When willingly I would have had her here!
[p]How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
[p]When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
[p]My penance is to call Lucetta back
[p]And ask remission for my folly past.
[p]What ho! Lucetta!
"
"What would your ladyship?
"
"Is't near dinner-time?
"
"I would it were,
[p]That you might kill your stomach on your meat
[p]And not upon your maid.
"
"What is't that you took up so gingerly?
"
"Nothing.
"
"Why didst thou stoop, then?
"
"To take a paper up that I let fall.
"
"And is that paper nothing?
"
"Nothing concerning me.
"
"Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
"
"Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
[p]Unless it have a false interpeter.
"
"Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
"
"That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
[p]Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
"
"As little by such toys as may be possible.
[p]Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
"
"It is too heavy for so light a tune.
"
"Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
"
"Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
"
"And why not you?
"
"I cannot reach so high.
"
"Let's see your song. How now, minion!
"
"Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
[p]And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
"
"You do not?
"
"No, madam; it is too sharp.
"
"You, minion, are too saucy.
"
"Nay, now you are too flat
[p]And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
[p]There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
"
"The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
"
"Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
"
"This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
[p]Here is a coil with protestation!
[p][Tears the letter]
[p]Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
[p]You would be fingering them, to anger me.
"
"She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
[p]To be so anger'd with another letter.
"
"Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
[p]O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
[p]Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
[p]And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
[p]I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
[p]Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
[p]As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
[p]I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
[p]Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
[p]And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
[p]Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
[p]Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
[p]And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
[p]But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
[p]Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
[p]Till I have found each letter in the letter,
[p]Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
[p]Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
[p]And throw it thence into the raging sea!
[p]Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
[p]'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
[p]To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
[p]And yet I will not, sith so prettily
[p]He couples it to his complaining names.
[p]Thus will I fold them one on another:
[p]Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
"
"Madam,
[p]Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
"
"Well, let us go.
"
"What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
"
"If you respect them, best to take them up.
"
"Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
[p]Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
"
"I see you have a month's mind to them.
"
"Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
[p]I see things too, although you judge I wink.
"
"Come, come; will't please you go?
"
"Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
[p]Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
"
"'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
"
"Why, what of him?
"
"He wonder'd that your lordship
[p]Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
[p]While other men, of slender reputation,
[p]Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
[p]Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
[p]Some to discover islands far away;
[p]Some to the studious universities.
[p]For any or for all these exercises,
[p]He said that Proteus your son was meet,
[p]And did request me to importune you
[p]To let him spend his time no more at home,
[p]Which would be great impeachment to his age,
[p]In having known no travel in his youth.
"
"Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
[p]Whereon this month I have been hammering.
[p]I have consider'd well his loss of time
[p]And how he cannot be a perfect man,
[p]Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
[p]Experience is by industry achieved
[p]And perfected by the swift course of time.
[p]Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?
"
"I think your lordship is not ignorant
[p]How his companion, youthful Valentine,
[p]Attends the emperor in his royal court.
"
"I know it well.
"
"'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
[p]There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
[p]Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.
[p]And be in eye of every exercise
[p]Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
"
"I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
[p]And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
[p]The execution of it shall make known.
[p]Even with the speediest expedition
[p]I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
"
"To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
[p]With other gentlemen of good esteem,
[p]Are journeying to salute the emperor
[p]And to commend their service to his will.
"
"Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
[p]And, in good time! now will we break with him.
"
"Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
[p]Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
[p]Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
[p]O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
[p]To seal our happiness with their consents!
[p]O heavenly Julia!
"
"How now! what letter are you reading there?
"
"May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
[p]Of commendations sent from Valentine,
[p]Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
"
"Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
"
"There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
[p]How happily he lives, how well beloved
[p]And daily graced by the emperor;
[p]Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
"
"And how stand you affected to his wish?
"
"As one relying on your lordship's will
[p]And not depending on his friendly wish.
"
"My will is something sorted with his wish.
[p]Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
[p]For what I will, I will, and there an end.
[p]I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
[p]With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
[p]What maintenance he from his friends receives,
[p]Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
[p]To-morrow be in readiness to go:
[p]Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
"
"My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
[p]Please you, deliberate a day or two.
"
"Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
[p]No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
[p]Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
[p]To hasten on his expedition.
"
"Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
[p]And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
[p]I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
[p]Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
[p]And with the vantage of mine own excuse
[p]Hath he excepted most against my love.
[p]O, how this spring of love resembleth
[p]The uncertain glory of an April day,
[p]Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
[p]And by and by a cloud takes all away!
"
"Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:
[p]He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.
"
"Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
[p]And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'
"
"Sir, your glove.
"
"Not mine; my gloves are on.
"
"Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
"
"Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
[p]Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
[p]Ah, Silvia, Silvia!
"
"Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
"
"How now, sirrah?
"
"She is not within hearing, sir.
"
"Why, sir, who bade you call her?
"
"Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
"
"Well, you'll still be too forward.
"
"And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
"
"Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
"
"She that your worship loves?
"
"Why, how know you that I am in love?
"
"Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
[p]learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
[p]like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
[p]robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
[p]the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
[p]lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
[p]buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
[p]diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
[p]speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
[p]wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
[p]walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
[p]fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
[p]looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
[p]are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
[p]on you, I can hardly think you my master.
"
"Are all these things perceived in me?
"
"They are all perceived without ye.
"
"Without me? they cannot.
"
"Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
[p]were so simple, none else would: but you are so
[p]without these follies, that these follies are within
[p]you and shine through you like the water in an
[p]urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
[p]physician to comment on your malady.
"
"But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
"
"She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
"
"Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
"
"Why, sir, I know her not.
"
"Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
[p]knowest her not?
"
"Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
"
"Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
"
"Sir, I know that well enough.
"
"What dost thou know?
"
"That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.
"
"I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
"
"That's because the one is painted and the other out
[p]of all count.
"
"How painted? and how out of count?
"
"Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
[p]man counts of her beauty.
"
"How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
"
"You never saw her since she was deformed.
"
"How long hath she been deformed?
"
"Ever since you loved her.
"
"I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
[p]see her beautiful.
"
"If you love her, you cannot see her.
"
"Why?
"
"Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
[p]or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
[p]have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
[p]ungartered!
"
"What should I see then?
"
"Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
[p]for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
[p]hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
"
"Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
[p]morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
"
"True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
[p]you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
[p]bolder to chide you for yours.
"
"In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
"
"I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
"
"Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
[p]one she loves.
"
"And have you?
"
"I have.
"
"Are they not lamely writ?
"
"No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
[p]here she comes.
"
"[Aside] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
[p]Now will he interpret to her.
"
"Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.
"
"[Aside] O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.
"
"Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
"
"[Aside] He should give her interest and she gives it him.
"
"As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
[p]Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
[p]Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
[p]But for my duty to your ladyship.
"
"I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
"
"Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
[p]For being ignorant to whom it goes
[p]I writ at random, very doubtfully.
"
"Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
"
"No, madam; so it stead you, I will write
[p]Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--
"
"A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
[p]And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
[p]And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
[p]Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
"
"[Aside] And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'
"
"What means your ladyship? do you not like it?
"
"Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
[p]But since unwillingly, take them again.
[p]Nay, take them.
"
"Madam, they are for you.
"
"Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;
[p]But I will none of them; they are for you;
[p]I would have had them writ more movingly.
"
"Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
"
"And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
[p]And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
"
"If it please me, madam, what then?
"
"Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:
[p]And so, good morrow, servant.
"
"O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
[p]As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!
[p]My master sues to her, and she hath
[p]taught her suitor,
[p]He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
[p]O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
[p]That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
[p]the letter?
"
"How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?
"
"Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
"
"To do what?
"
"To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
"
"To whom?
"
"To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.
"
"What figure?
"
"By a letter, I should say.
"
"Why, she hath not writ to me?
"
"What need she, when she hath made you write to
[p]yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
"
"No, believe me.
"
"No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
[p]her earnest?
"
"She gave me none, except an angry word.
"
"Why, she hath given you a letter.
"
"That's the letter I writ to her friend.
"
"And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.
"
"I would it were no worse.
"
"I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
[p]For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
[p]Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
[p]Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
[p]Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
[p]All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
[p]Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.
"
"I have dined.
"
"Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can
[p]feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my
[p]victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like
[p]your mistress; be moved, be moved.
"
"Have patience, gentle Julia.
"
"I must, where is no remedy.
"
"When possibly I can, I will return.
"
"If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
[p]Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
"
"Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.
"
"And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
"
"Here is my hand for my true constancy;
[p]And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
[p]Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
[p]The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
[p]Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
[p]My father stays my coming; answer not;
[p]The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
[p]That tide will stay me longer than I should.
[p]Julia, farewell!
[p][Exit JULIA]
[p]What, gone without a word?
[p]Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
[p]For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
"
"Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.
"
"Go; I come, I come.
[p]Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
"
"Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;
[p]all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
[p]have received my proportion, like the prodigious
[p]son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's
[p]court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured
[p]dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
[p]wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
[p]wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
[p]perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
[p]one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
[p]has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
[p]wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,
[p]having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my
[p]parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This
[p]shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:
[p]no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
[p]cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
[p]hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
[p]it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
[p]on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my
[p]sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
[p]as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
[p]am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
[p]dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
[p]so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
[p]now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
[p]now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
[p]come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
[p]like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
[p]'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
[p]come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
[p]the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
[p]word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.
"
"Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped
[p]and thou art to post after with oars. What's the
[p]matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll
[p]lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.
"
"It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the
[p]unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
"
"What's the unkindest tide?
"
"Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.
"
"Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in
[p]losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
[p]thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
[p]master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
[p]service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?
"
"For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
"
"Where should I lose my tongue?
"
"In thy tale.
"
"In thy tail!
"
"Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and
[p]the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river
[p]were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
[p]wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.
"
"Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
"
"Sir, call me what thou darest.
"
"Wilt thou go?
"
"Well, I will go.
"
"Servant!
"
"Mistress?
"
"Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.
"
"Ay, boy, it's for love.
"
"Not of you.
"
"Of my mistress, then.
"
"'Twere good you knocked him.
"
"Servant, you are sad.
"
"Indeed, madam, I seem so.
"
"Seem you that you are not?
"
"Haply I do.
"
"So do counterfeits.
"
"So do you.
"
"What seem I that I am not?
"
"Wise.
"
"What instance of the contrary?
"
"Your folly.
"
"And how quote you my folly?
"
"I quote it in your jerkin.
"
"My jerkin is a doublet.
"
"Well, then, I'll double your folly.
"
"How?
"
"What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?
"
"Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
"
"That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
[p]in your air.
"
"You have said, sir.
"
"Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
"
"I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
"
"A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
"
"'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
"
"Who is that, servant?
"
"Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir
[p]Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,
[p]and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
"
"Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall
[p]make your wit bankrupt.
"
"I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
[p]and, I think, no other treasure to give your
[p]followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,
[p]that they live by your bare words.
"
"No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.
"
"Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
[p]Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
[p]What say you to a letter from your friends
[p]Of much good news?
"
"My lord, I will be thankful.
[p]To any happy messenger from thence.
"
"Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
"
"Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
[p]To be of worth and worthy estimation
[p]And not without desert so well reputed.
"
"Hath he not a son?
"
"Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
[p]The honour and regard of such a father.
"
"You know him well?
"
"I know him as myself; for from our infancy
[p]We have conversed and spent our hours together:
[p]And though myself have been an idle truant,
[p]Omitting the sweet benefit of time
[p]To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
[p]Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
[p]Made use and fair advantage of his days;
[p]His years but young, but his experience old;
[p]His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
[p]And, in a word, for far behind his worth
[p]Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
[p]He is complete in feature and in mind
[p]With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
"
"Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
[p]He is as worthy for an empress' love
[p]As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
[p]Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
[p]With commendation from great potentates;
[p]And here he means to spend his time awhile:
[p]I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
"
"Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
"
"Welcome him then according to his worth.
[p]Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
[p]For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:
[p]I will send him hither to you presently.
"
"This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
[p]Had come along with me, but that his mistress
[p]Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
"
"Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
[p]Upon some other pawn for fealty.
"
"Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
"
"Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
[p]How could he see his way to seek out you?
"
"Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
"
"They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
"
"To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
[p]Upon a homely object Love can wink.
"
"Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
"
"Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,
[p]Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
"
"His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
[p]If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
"
"Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
[p]To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
"
"Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
"
"Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant
[p]To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
"
"Leave off discourse of disability:
[p]Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
"
"My duty will I boast of; nothing else.
"
"And duty never yet did want his meed:
[p]Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
"
"I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
"
"That you are welcome?
"
"That you are worthless.
"
"Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
"
"I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
[p]Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
[p]I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
[p]When you have done, we look to hear from you.
"
"We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
"
"Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
"
"Your friends are well and have them much commended.
"
"And how do yours?
"
"I left them all in health.
"
"How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
"
"My tales of love were wont to weary you;
[p]I know you joy not in a love discourse.
"
"Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
[p]I have done penance for contemning Love,
[p]Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
[p]With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
[p]With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
[p]For in revenge of my contempt of love,
[p]Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
[p]And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
[p]O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
[p]And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
[p]There is no woe to his correction,
[p]Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
[p]Now no discourse, except it be of love;
[p]Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
[p]Upon the very naked name of love.
"
"Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
[p]Was this the idol that you worship so?
"
"Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
"
"No; but she is an earthly paragon.
"
"Call her divine.
"
"I will not flatter her.
"
"O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.
"
"When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
[p]And I must minister the like to you.
"
"Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
[p]Yet let her be a principality,
[p]Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
"
"Except my mistress.
"
"Sweet, except not any;
[p]Except thou wilt except against my love.
"
"Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
"
"And I will help thee to prefer her too:
[p]She shall be dignified with this high honour--
[p]To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
[p]Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
[p]And, of so great a favour growing proud,
[p]Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
[p]And make rough winter everlastingly.
"
"Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
"
"Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
[p]To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
[p]She is alone.
"
"Then let her alone.
"
"Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
[p]And I as rich in having such a jewel
[p]As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
[p]The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
[p]Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
[p]Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
[p]My foolish rival, that her father likes
[p]Only for his possessions are so huge,
[p]Is gone with her along, and I must after,
[p]For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
"
"But she loves you?
"
"Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
[p]marriage-hour,
[p]With all the cunning manner of our flight,
[p]Determined of; how I must climb her window,
[p]The ladder made of cords, and all the means
[p]Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
[p]Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
[p]In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
"
"Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
[p]I must unto the road, to disembark
[p]Some necessaries that I needs must use,
[p]And then I'll presently attend you.
"
"Will you make haste?
"
"I will.
[p][Exit VALENTINE]
[p]Even as one heat another heat expels,
[p]Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
[p]So the remembrance of my former love
[p]Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
[p]Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
[p]Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
[p]That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
[p]She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
[p]That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
[p]Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
[p]Bears no impression of the thing it was.
[p]Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
[p]And that I love him not as I was wont.
[p]O, but I love his lady too too much,
[p]And that's the reason I love him so little.
[p]How shall I dote on her with more advice,
[p]That thus without advice begin to love her!
[p]'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
[p]And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
[p]But when I look on her perfections,
[p]There is no reason but I shall be blind.
[p]If I can cheque my erring love, I will;
[p]If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.
"
"Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!
"
"Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not
[p]welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never
[p]undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a
[p]place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
[p]say 'Welcome!'
"
"Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you
[p]presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou
[p]shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how
[p]did thy master part with Madam Julia?
"
"Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very
[p]fairly in jest.
"
"But shall she marry him?
"
"No.
"
"How then? shall he marry her?
"
"No, neither.
"
"What, are they broken?
"
"No, they are both as whole as a fish.
"
"Why, then, how stands the matter with them?
"
"Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it
[p]stands well with her.
"
"What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
"
"What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My
[p]staff understands me.
"
"What thou sayest?
"
"Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,
[p]and my staff understands me.
"
"It stands under thee, indeed.
"
"Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
"
"But tell me true, will't be a match?
"
"Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,
[p]it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.
"
"The conclusion is then that it will.
"
"Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
"
"'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest
[p]thou, that my master is become a notable lover?
"
"I never knew him otherwise.
"
"Than how?
"
"A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
"
"Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.
"
"Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.
"
"I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
"
"Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself
[p]in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;
[p]if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the
[p]name of a Christian.
"
"Why?
"
"Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
[p]go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
"
"At thy service.
"
"To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
[p]To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
[p]To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
[p]And even that power which gave me first my oath
[p]Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
[p]Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
[p]O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
[p]Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
[p]At first I did adore a twinkling star,
[p]But now I worship a celestial sun.
[p]Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
[p]And he wants wit that wants resolved will
[p]To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
[p]Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
[p]Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
[p]With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
[p]I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
[p]But there I leave to love where I should love.
[p]Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
[p]If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
[p]If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
[p]For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
[p]I to myself am dearer than a friend,
[p]For love is still most precious in itself;
[p]And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
[p]Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
[p]I will forget that Julia is alive,
[p]Remembering that my love to her is dead;
[p]And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
[p]Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
[p]I cannot now prove constant to myself,
[p]Without some treachery used to Valentine.
[p]This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
[p]To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
[p]Myself in counsel, his competitor.
[p]Now presently I'll give her father notice
[p]Of their disguising and pretended flight;
[p]Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
[p]For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
[p]But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
[p]By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
[p]Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
[p]As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
"
"Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
[p]And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
[p]Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
[p]Are visibly character'd and engraved,
[p]To lesson me and tell me some good mean
[p]How, with my honour, I may undertake
[p]A journey to my loving Proteus.
"
"Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
"
"A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
[p]To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
[p]Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
[p]And when the flight is made to one so dear,
[p]Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
"
"Better forbear till Proteus make return.
"
"O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
[p]Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
[p]By longing for that food so long a time.
[p]Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
[p]Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
[p]As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
"
"I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
[p]But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
[p]Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
"
"The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
[p]The current that with gentle murmur glides,
[p]Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
[p]But when his fair course is not hindered,
[p]He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,
[p]Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
[p]He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
[p]And so by many winding nooks he strays
[p]With willing sport to the wild ocean.
[p]Then let me go and hinder not my course
[p]I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
[p]And make a pastime of each weary step,
[p]Till the last step have brought me to my love;
[p]And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
[p]A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
"
"But in what habit will you go along?
"
"Not like a woman; for I would prevent
[p]The loose encounters of lascivious men:
[p]Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
[p]As may beseem some well-reputed page.
"
"Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
"
"No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
[p]With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
[p]To be fantastic may become a youth
[p]Of greater time than I shall show to be.
"
"What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?
"
"That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
[p]What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
[p]Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.
"
"You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
"
"Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.
"
"A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
[p]Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
"
"Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
[p]What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
[p]But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
[p]For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
[p]I fear me, it will make me scandalized.
"
"If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
"
"Nay, that I will not.
"
"Then never dream on infamy, but go.
[p]If Proteus like your journey when you come,
[p]No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
[p]I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.
"
"That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
[p]A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
[p]And instances of infinite of love
[p]Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
"
"All these are servants to deceitful men.
"
"Base men, that use them to so base effect!
[p]But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
[p]His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
[p]His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
[p]His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
[p]His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
"
"Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!
"
"Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
[p]To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
[p]Only deserve my love by loving him;
[p]And presently go with me to my chamber,
[p]To take a note of what I stand in need of,
[p]To furnish me upon my longing journey.
[p]All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
[p]My goods, my lands, my reputation;
[p]Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
[p]Come, answer not, but to it presently!
[p]I am impatient of my tarriance.
"
"Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
[p]We have some secrets to confer about.
[p][Exit THURIO]
[p]Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
"
"My gracious lord, that which I would discover
[p]The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
[p]But when I call to mind your gracious favours
[p]Done to me, undeserving as I am,
[p]My duty pricks me on to utter that
[p]Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
[p]Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
[p]This night intends to steal away your daughter:
[p]Myself am one made privy to the plot.
[p]I know you have determined to bestow her
[p]On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
[p]And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
[p]It would be much vexation to your age.
[p]Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
[p]To cross my friend in his intended drift
[p]Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
[p]A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
[p]Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
"
"Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
[p]Which to requite, command me while I live.
[p]This love of theirs myself have often seen,
[p]Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
[p]And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
[p]Sir Valentine her company and my court:
[p]But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
[p]And so unworthily disgrace the man,
[p]A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
[p]I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
[p]That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
[p]And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
[p]Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
[p]I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
[p]The key whereof myself have ever kept;
[p]And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
"
"Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
[p]How he her chamber-window will ascend
[p]And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
[p]For which the youthful lover now is gone
[p]And this way comes he with it presently;
[p]Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
[p]But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly
[p]That my discovery be not aimed at;
[p]For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
[p]Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
"
"Upon mine honour, he shall never know
[p]That I had any light from thee of this.
"
"Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.
"
"Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
"
"Please it your grace, there is a messenger
[p]That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
[p]And I am going to deliver them.
"
"Be they of much import?
"
"The tenor of them doth but signify
[p]My health and happy being at your court.
"
"Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
[p]I am to break with thee of some affairs
[p]That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
[p]'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
[p]To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
"
"I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
[p]Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
[p]Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
[p]Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
[p]Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
"
"No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
[p]Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
[p]Neither regarding that she is my child
[p]Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
[p]And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
[p]Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
[p]And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
[p]Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
[p]I now am full resolved to take a wife
[p]And turn her out to who will take her in:
[p]Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
[p]For me and my possessions she esteems not.
"
"What would your Grace have me to do in this?
"
"There is a lady in Verona here
[p]Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
[p]And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
[p]Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
[p]For long agone I have forgot to court;
[p]Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
[p]How and which way I may bestow myself
[p]To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
"
"Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
[p]Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
[p]More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
"
"But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
"
"A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
[p]Send her another; never give her o'er;
[p]For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
[p]If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
[p]But rather to beget more love in you:
[p]If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
[p]For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
[p]Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
[p]For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
[p]Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
[p]Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
[p]That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
[p]If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
"
"But she I mean is promised by her friends
[p]Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
[p]And kept severely from resort of men,
[p]That no man hath access by day to her.
"
"Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
"
"Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
[p]That no man hath recourse to her by night.
"
"What lets but one may enter at her window?
"
"Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
[p]And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
[p]Without apparent hazard of his life.
"
"Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
[p]To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
[p]Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
[p]So bold Leander would adventure it.
"
"Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
[p]Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
"
"When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
"
"This very night; for Love is like a child,
[p]That longs for every thing that he can come by.
"
"By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
"
"But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
[p]How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
"
"It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
[p]Under a cloak that is of any length.
"
"A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"Then let me see thy cloak:
[p]I'll get me one of such another length.
"
"Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
"
"How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
[p]I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
[p]What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
[p]And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
[p]I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
[p][Reads]
[p]'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
[p]And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
[p]O, could their master come and go as lightly,
[p]Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
[p]My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
[p]While I, their king, that hither them importune,
[p]Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
[p]Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
[p]I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
[p]That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
[p]What's here?
[p]'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
[p]'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
[p]Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--
[p]Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
[p]And with thy daring folly burn the world?
[p]Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
[p]Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
[p]Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
[p]And think my patience, more than thy desert,
[p]Is privilege for thy departure hence:
[p]Thank me for this more than for all the favours
[p]Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
[p]But if thou linger in my territories
[p]Longer than swiftest expedition
[p]Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
[p]By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
[p]I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
[p]Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
[p]But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
"
"And why not death rather than living torment?
[p]To die is to be banish'd from myself;
[p]And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
[p]Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
[p]What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
[p]What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
[p]Unless it be to think that she is by
[p]And feed upon the shadow of perfection
[p]Except I be by Silvia in the night,
[p]There is no music in the nightingale;
[p]Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
[p]There is no day for me to look upon;
[p]She is my essence, and I leave to be,
[p]If I be not by her fair influence
[p]Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
[p]I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
[p]Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
[p]But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.
"
"Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.
"
"Soho, soho!
"
"What seest thou?
"
"Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head
[p]but 'tis a Valentine.
"
"Valentine?
"
"No.
"
"Who then? his spirit?
"
"Neither.
"
"What then?
"
"Nothing.
"
"Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?
"
"Who wouldst thou strike?
"
"Nothing.
"
"Villain, forbear.
"
"Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--
"
"Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
"
"My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,
[p]So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
"
"Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
[p]For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
"
"Is Silvia dead?
"
"No, Valentine.
"
"No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
[p]Hath she forsworn me?
"
"No, Valentine.
"
"No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
[p]What is your news?
"
"Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
"
"That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--
[p]From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.
"
"O, I have fed upon this woe already,
[p]And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
[p]Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
"
"Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--
[p]Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--
[p]A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:
[p]Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
[p]With them, upon her knees, her humble self;
[p]Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
[p]As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
[p]But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
[p]Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
[p]Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
[p]But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
[p]Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
[p]When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
[p]That to close prison he commanded her,
[p]With many bitter threats of biding there.
"
"No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
[p]Have some malignant power upon my life:
[p]If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,
[p]As ending anthem of my endless dolour.
"
"Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
[p]And study help for that which thou lament'st.
[p]Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
[p]Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
[p]Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
[p]Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
[p]And manage it against despairing thoughts.
[p]Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;
[p]Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
[p]Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
[p]The time now serves not to expostulate:
[p]Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;
[p]And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
[p]Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
[p]As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,
[p]Regard thy danger, and along with me!
"
"I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
[p]Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.
"
"Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.
"
"O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
"
"I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit to
[p]think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's
[p]all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now
[p]that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a
[p]team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who
[p]'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I
[p]will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet
[p]'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis
[p]a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for
[p]wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;
[p]which is much in a bare Christian.
[p][Pulling out a paper]
[p]Here is the cate-log of her condition.
[p]'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse
[p]can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only
[p]carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:
[p]She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid
[p]with clean hands.
"
"How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
[p]mastership?
"
"With my master's ship? why, it is at sea.
"
"Well, your old vice still; mistake the word. What
[p]news, then, in your paper?
"
"The blackest news that ever thou heardest.
"
"Why, man, how black?
"
"Why, as black as ink.
"
"Let me read them.
"
"Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.
"
"Thou liest; I can.
"
"I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?
"
"Marry, the son of my grandfather.
"
"O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy
[p]grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.
"
"Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.
"
"There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!
"
"[Reads] 'Imprimis: She can milk.'
"
"Ay, that she can.
"
"'Item: She brews good ale.'
"
"And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your
[p]heart, you brew good ale.'
"
"'Item: She can sew.'
"
"That's as much as to say, Can she so?
"
"'Item: She can knit.'
"
"What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when
[p]she can knit him a stock?
"
"'Item: She can wash and scour.'
"
"A special virtue: for then she need not be washed
[p]and scoured.
"
"'Item: She can spin.'
"
"Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can
[p]spin for her living.
"
"'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'
"
"That's as much as to say, bastard virtues; that,
[p]indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names.
"
"'Here follow her vices.'
"
"Close at the heels of her virtues.
"
"'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect
[p]of her breath.'
"
"Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.
"
"'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'
"
"That makes amends for her sour breath.
"
"'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
"
"It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.
"
"'Item: She is slow in words.'
"
"O villain, that set this down among her vices! To
[p]be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray
[p]thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue.
"
"'Item: She is proud.'
"
"Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot
[p]be ta'en from her.
"
"'Item: She hath no teeth.'
"
"I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
"
"'Item: She is curst.'
"
"Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
"
"'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
"
"If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I
[p]will; for good things should be praised.
"
"'Item: She is too liberal.'
"
"Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she
[p]is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that
[p]I'll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and
[p]that cannot I help. Well, proceed.
"
"'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults
[p]than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'
"
"Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine, and not
[p]mine, twice or thrice in that last article.
[p]Rehearse that once more.
"
"'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--
"
"More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it. The
[p]cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it
[p]is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit
[p]is more than the wit, for the greater hides the
[p]less. What's next?
"
"'And more faults than hairs,'--
"
"That's monstrous: O, that that were out!
"
"'And more wealth than faults.'
"
"Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,
[p]I'll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is
[p]impossible,--
"
"What then?
"
"Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays
[p]for thee at the North-gate.
"
"For me?
"
"For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a
[p]better man than thee.
"
"And must I go to him?
"
"Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long
[p]that going will scarce serve the turn.
"
"Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!
"
"Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an
[p]unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
[p]secrets! I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.
"
"Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
[p]Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
"
"Since his exile she hath despised me most,
[p]Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
[p]That I am desperate of obtaining her.
"
"This weak impress of love is as a figure
[p]Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
[p]Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
[p]A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
[p]And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
[p][Enter PROTEUS]
[p]How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
[p]According to our proclamation gone?
"
"Gone, my good lord.
"
"My daughter takes his going grievously.
"
"A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
"
"So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
[p]Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
[p]For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
[p]Makes me the better to confer with thee.
"
"Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
[p]Let me not live to look upon your grace.
"
"Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
[p]The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
"
"I do, my lord.
"
"And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
[p]How she opposes her against my will
"
"She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
"
"Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
[p]What might we do to make the girl forget
[p]The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
"
"The best way is to slander Valentine
[p]With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
[p]Three things that women highly hold in hate.
"
"Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
"
"Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
[p]Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
[p]By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
"
"Then you must undertake to slander him.
"
"And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
[p]'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
[p]Especially against his very friend.
"
"Where your good word cannot advantage him,
[p]Your slander never can endamage him;
[p]Therefore the office is indifferent,
[p]Being entreated to it by your friend.
"
"You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it
[p]By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,
[p]She shall not long continue love to him.
[p]But say this weed her love from Valentine,
[p]It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
"
"Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
[p]Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
[p]You must provide to bottom it on me;
[p]Which must be done by praising me as much
[p]As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
"
"And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
[p]Because we know, on Valentine's report,
[p]You are already Love's firm votary
[p]And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
[p]Upon this warrant shall you have access
[p]Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
[p]For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
[p]And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
[p]Where you may temper her by your persuasion
[p]To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
"
"As much as I can do, I will effect:
[p]But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
[p]You must lay lime to tangle her desires
[p]By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
[p]Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
"
"Ay,
[p]Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
"
"Say that upon the altar of her beauty
[p]You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
[p]Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
[p]Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
[p]That may discover such integrity:
[p]For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
[p]Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
[p]Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
[p]Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
[p]After your dire-lamenting elegies,
[p]Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
[p]With some sweet concert; to their instruments
[p]Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
[p]Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
[p]This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
"
"This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
"
"And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
[p]Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
[p]Let us into the city presently
[p]To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
[p]I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
[p]To give the onset to thy good advice.
"
"About it, gentlemen!
"
"We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
[p]And afterward determine our proceedings.
"
"Even now about it! I will pardon you.
"
"Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
"
"If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
"
"Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:
[p]If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.
"
"Sir, we are undone; these are the villains
[p]That all the travellers do fear so much.
"
"My friends,--
"
"That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.
"
"Peace! we'll hear him.
"
"Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.
"
"Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
[p]A man I am cross'd with adversity;
[p]My riches are these poor habiliments,
[p]Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
[p]You take the sum and substance that I have.
"
"Whither travel you?
"
"To Verona.
"
"Whence came you?
"
"From Milan.
"
"Have you long sojourned there?
"
"Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
[p]If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
"
"What, were you banish'd thence?
"
"I was.
"
"For what offence?
"
"For that which now torments me to rehearse:
[p]I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
[p]But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
[p]Without false vantage or base treachery.
"
"Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
[p]But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
"
"I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
"
"Have you the tongues?
"
"My youthful travel therein made me happy,
[p]Or else I often had been miserable.
"
"By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
[p]This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
"
"We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
"
"Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.
"
"Peace, villain!
"
"Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
"
"Nothing but my fortune.
"
"Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
[p]Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
[p]Thrust from the company of awful men:
[p]Myself was from Verona banished
[p]For practising to steal away a lady,
[p]An heir, and near allied unto the duke.
"
"And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
[p]Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
"
"And I for such like petty crimes as these,
[p]But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
[p]That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
[p]And partly, seeing you are beautified
[p]With goodly shape and by your own report
[p]A linguist and a man of such perfection
[p]As we do in our quality much want--
"
"Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
[p]Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
[p]Are you content to be our general?
[p]To make a virtue of necessity
[p]And live, as we do, in this wilderness?
"
"What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
[p]Say ay, and be the captain of us all:
[p]We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
[p]Love thee as our commander and our king.
"
"But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
"
"Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
"
"I take your offer and will live with you,
[p]Provided that you do no outrages
[p]On silly women or poor passengers.
"
"No, we detest such vile base practises.
[p]Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
[p]And show thee all the treasure we have got,
[p]Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.
"
"Already have I been false to Valentine
[p]And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
[p]Under the colour of commending him,
[p]I have access my own love to prefer:
[p]But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
[p]To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
[p]When I protest true loyalty to her,
[p]She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
[p]When to her beauty I commend my vows,
[p]She bids me think how I have been forsworn
[p]In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
[p]And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
[p]The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
[p]Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
[p]The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
[p]But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
[p]And give some evening music to her ear.
"
"How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
"
"Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love
[p]Will creep in service where it cannot go.
"
"Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
"
"Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
"
"Who? Silvia?
"
"Ay, Silvia; for your sake.
"
"I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
[p]Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
"
"Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I
[p]pray you, why is it?
"
"Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
"
"Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where
[p]you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
"
"But shall I hear him speak?
"
"Ay, that you shall.
"
"That will be music.
"
"Hark, hark!
"
"Is he among these?
"
"Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.
[p]SONG.
[p]Who is Silvia? what is she,
[p]That all our swains commend her?
[p]Holy, fair and wise is she;
[p]The heaven such grace did lend her,
[p]That she might admired be.
[p]Is she kind as she is fair?
[p]For beauty lives with kindness.
[p]Love doth to her eyes repair,
[p]To help him of his blindness,
[p]And, being help'd, inhabits there.
[p]Then to Silvia let us sing,
[p]That Silvia is excelling;
[p]She excels each mortal thing
[p]Upon the dull earth dwelling:
[p]To her let us garlands bring.
"
"How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
[p]do you, man? the music likes you not.
"
"You mistake; the musician likes me not.
"
"Why, my pretty youth?
"
"He plays false, father.
"
"How? out of tune on the strings?
"
"Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
[p]heart-strings.
"
"You have a quick ear.
"
"Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
"
"I perceive you delight not in music.
"
"Not a whit, when it jars so.
"
"Hark, what fine change is in the music!
"
"Ay, that change is the spite.
"
"You would have them always play but one thing?
"
"I would always have one play but one thing.
[p]But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
[p]Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
"
"I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved
[p]her out of all nick.
"
"Where is Launce?
"
"Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
[p]master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
"
"Peace! stand aside: the company parts.
"
"Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
[p]That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
"
"Where meet we?
"
"At Saint Gregory's well.
"
"Farewell.
"
"Madam, good even to your ladyship.
"
"I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
[p]Who is that that spake?
"
"One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
[p]You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
"
"Sir Proteus, as I take it.
"
"Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
"
"What's your will?
"
"That I may compass yours.
"
"You have your wish; my will is even this:
[p]That presently you hie you home to bed.
[p]Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
[p]Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
[p]To be seduced by thy flattery,
[p]That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
[p]Return, return, and make thy love amends.
[p]For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
[p]I am so far from granting thy request
[p]That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
[p]And by and by intend to chide myself
[p]Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
"
"I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
[p]But she is dead.
"
"[Aside] 'Twere false, if I should speak it;
[p]For I am sure she is not buried.
"
"Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
[p]Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,
[p]I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
[p]To wrong him with thy importunacy?
"
"I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
"
"And so suppose am I; for in his grave
[p]Assure thyself my love is buried.
"
"Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
"
"Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
[p]Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
"
"[Aside] He heard not that.
"
"Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
[p]Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
[p]The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
[p]To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:
[p]For since the substance of your perfect self
[p]Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
[p]And to your shadow will I make true love.
"
"[Aside] If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,
[p]deceive it,
[p]And make it but a shadow, as I am.
"
"I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
[p]But since your falsehood shall become you well
[p]To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
[p]Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
[p]And so, good rest.
"
"As wretches have o'ernight
[p]That wait for execution in the morn.
"
"Host, will you go?
"
"By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
"
"Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
"
"Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost
[p]day.
"
"Not so; but it hath been the longest night
[p]That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.
"
"This is the hour that Madam Silvia
[p]Entreated me to call and know her mind:
[p]There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
[p]Madam, madam!
"
"Who calls?
"
"Your servant and your friend;
[p]One that attends your ladyship's command.
"
"Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.
"
"As many, worthy lady, to yourself:
[p]According to your ladyship's impose,
[p]I am thus early come to know what service
[p]It is your pleasure to command me in.
"
"O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
[p]Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
[p]Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:
[p]Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
[p]I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,
[p]Nor how my father would enforce me marry
[p]Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
[p]Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say
[p]No grief did ever come so near thy heart
[p]As when thy lady and thy true love died,
[p]Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
[p]Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
[p]To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
[p]And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
[p]I do desire thy worthy company,
[p]Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
[p]Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
[p]But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
[p]And on the justice of my flying hence,
[p]To keep me from a most unholy match,
[p]Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
[p]I do desire thee, even from a heart
[p]As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
[p]To bear me company and go with me:
[p]If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
[p]That I may venture to depart alone.
"
"Madam, I pity much your grievances;
[p]Which since I know they virtuously are placed,
[p]I give consent to go along with you,
[p]Recking as little what betideth me
[p]As much I wish all good befortune you.
[p]When will you go?
"
"This evening coming.
"
"Where shall I meet you?
"
"At Friar Patrick's cell,
[p]Where I intend holy confession.
"
"I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
"
"Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.
"
"When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
[p]look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
[p]puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
[p]four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
[p]I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
[p]'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
[p]him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
[p]and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
[p]steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
[p]O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
[p]in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
[p]one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
[p]as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
[p]more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
[p]I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
[p]live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
[p]thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
[p]gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
[p]not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
[p]all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
[p]one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
[p]out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
[p]I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
[p]knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
[p]whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
[p]the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
[p]the more wrong,' quoth I; 'twas I did the thing you
[p]wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
[p]of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
[p]his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
[p]stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
[p]been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
[p]he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
[p]Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
[p]trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
[p]Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
[p]do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
[p]water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
[p]thou ever see me do such a trick?
"
"Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
[p]And will employ thee in some service presently.
"
"In what you please: I'll do what I can.
"
"I hope thou wilt.
[p][To LAUNCE]
[p]How now, you whoreson peasant!
[p]Where have you been these two days loitering?
"
"Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
"
"And what says she to my little jewel?
"
"Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you
[p]currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
"
"But she received my dog?
"
"No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
[p]back again.
"
"What, didst thou offer her this from me?
"
"Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
[p]the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
[p]offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
[p]yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
"
"Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
[p]Or ne'er return again into my sight.
[p]Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?
[p][Exit LAUNCE]
[p]A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
[p]Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
[p]Partly that I have need of such a youth
[p]That can with some discretion do my business,
[p]For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
[p]But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
[p]Which, if my augury deceive me not,
[p]Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:
[p]Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
[p]Go presently and take this ring with thee,
[p]Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
[p]She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
"
"It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
[p]She is dead, belike?
"
"Not so; I think she lives.
"
"Alas!
"
"Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
"
"I cannot choose
[p]But pity her.
"
"Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
"
"Because methinks that she loved you as well
[p]As you do love your lady Silvia:
[p]She dreams of him that has forgot her love;
[p]You dote on her that cares not for your love.
[p]'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
[p]And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
"
"Well, give her that ring and therewithal
[p]This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
[p]I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
[p]Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
[p]Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.
"
"How many women would do such a message?
[p]Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
[p]A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
[p]Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
[p]That with his very heart despiseth me?
[p]Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
[p]Because I love him I must pity him.
[p]This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
[p]To bind him to remember my good will;
[p]And now am I, unhappy messenger,
[p]To plead for that which I would not obtain,
[p]To carry that which I would have refused,
[p]To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
[p]I am my master's true-confirmed love;
[p]But cannot be true servant to my master,
[p]Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
[p]Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
[p]As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
[p][Enter SILVIA, attended]
[p]Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
[p]To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
"
"What would you with her, if that I be she?
"
"If you be she, I do entreat your patience
[p]To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
"
"From whom?
"
"From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
"
"O, he sends you for a picture.
"
"Ay, madam.
"
"Ursula, bring my picture here.
[p]Go give your master this: tell him from me,
[p]One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
[p]Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
"
"Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
[p]Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
[p]Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
[p]This is the letter to your ladyship.
"
"I pray thee, let me look on that again.
"
"It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
"
"There, hold!
[p]I will not look upon your master's lines:
[p]I know they are stuff'd with protestations
[p]And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
[p]As easily as I do tear his paper.
"
"Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
"
"The more shame for him that he sends it me;
[p]For I have heard him say a thousand times
[p]His Julia gave it him at his departure.
[p]Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
[p]Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
"
"She thanks you.
"
"What say'st thou?
"
"I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
[p]Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
"
"Dost thou know her?
"
"Almost as well as I do know myself:
[p]To think upon her woes I do protest
[p]That I have wept a hundred several times.
"
"Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
"
"I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
"
"Is she not passing fair?
"
"She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
[p]When she did think my master loved her well,
[p]She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
[p]But since she did neglect her looking-glass
[p]And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
[p]The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
[p]And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
[p]That now she is become as black as I.
"
"How tall was she?
"
"About my stature; for at Pentecost,
[p]When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
[p]Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
[p]And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
[p]Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
[p]As if the garment had been made for me:
[p]Therefore I know she is about my height.
[p]And at that time I made her weep agood,
[p]For I did play a lamentable part:
[p]Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
[p]For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
[p]Which I so lively acted with my tears
[p]That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
[p]Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
[p]If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
"
"She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
[p]Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
[p]I weep myself to think upon thy words.
[p]Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
[p]For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
[p]Farewell.
"
"And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
[p]A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
[p]I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
[p]Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
[p]Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
[p]Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
[p]If I had such a tire, this face of mine
[p]Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
[p]And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
[p]Unless I flatter with myself too much.
[p]Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
[p]If that be all the difference in his love,
[p]I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
[p]Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
[p]Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
[p]What should it be that he respects in her
[p]But I can make respective in myself,
[p]If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
[p]Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
[p]For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
[p]Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
[p]And, were there sense in his idolatry,
[p]My substance should be statue in thy stead.
[p]I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
[p]That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
[p]I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
[p]To make my master out of love with thee!
"
"The sun begins to gild the western sky;
[p]And now it is about the very hour
[p]That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
[p]She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
[p]Unless it be to come before their time;
[p]So much they spur their expedition.
[p]See where she comes.
[p][Enter SILVIA]
[p]Lady, a happy evening!
"
"Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
[p]Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
[p]I fear I am attended by some spies.
"
"Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
[p]If we recover that, we are sure enough.
"
"Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
"
"O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
[p]And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
"
"What, that my leg is too long?
"
"No; that it is too little.
"
"I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.
"
"[Aside] But love will not be spurr'd to what
[p]it loathes.
"
"What says she to my face?
"
"She says it is a fair one.
"
"Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
"
"But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
[p]Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
"
"[Aside] 'Tis true; such pearls as put out
[p]ladies' eyes;
[p]For I had rather wink than look on them.
"
"How likes she my discourse?
"
"Ill, when you talk of war.
"
"But well, when I discourse of love and peace?
"
"[Aside] But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
"
"What says she to my valour?
"
"O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
"
"[Aside] She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
"
"What says she to my birth?
"
"That you are well derived.
"
"[Aside] True; from a gentleman to a fool.
"
"Considers she my possessions?
"
"O, ay; and pities them.
"
"Wherefore?
"
"[Aside] That such an ass should owe them.
"
"That they are out by lease.
"
"Here comes the duke.
"
"How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
[p]Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
"
"Not I.
"
"Nor I.
"
"Saw you my daughter?
"
"Neither.
"
"Why then,
[p]She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
[p]And Eglamour is in her company.
[p]'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
[p]As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
[p]Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
[p]But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
[p]Besides, she did intend confession
[p]At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
[p]These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
[p]Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
[p]But mount you presently and meet with me
[p]Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
[p]That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:
[p]Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
"
"Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
[p]That flies her fortune when it follows her.
[p]I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
[p]Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
"
"And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
[p]Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
"
"And I will follow, more to cross that love
[p]Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
"
"Come, come,
[p]Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.
"
"A thousand more mischances than this one
[p]Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
"
"Come, bring her away.
"
"Where is the gentleman that was with her?
"
"Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
[p]But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
[p]Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
[p]There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
[p]The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.
"
"Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
[p]Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
[p]And will not use a woman lawlessly.
"
"O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
"
"How use doth breed a habit in a man!
[p]This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
[p]I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
[p]Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
[p]And to the nightingale's complaining notes
[p]Tune my distresses and record my woes.
[p]O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
[p]Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
[p]Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
[p]And leave no memory of what it was!
[p]Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
[p]Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
[p]What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
[p]These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
[p]Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
[p]They love me well; yet I have much to do
[p]To keep them from uncivil outrages.
[p]Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?
"
"Madam, this service I have done for you,
[p]Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
[p]To hazard life and rescue you from him
[p]That would have forced your honour and your love;
[p]Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
[p]A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
[p]And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
"
"[Aside] How like a dream is this I see and hear!
[p]Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
"
"O miserable, unhappy that I am!
"
"Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
[p]But by my coming I have made you happy.
"
"By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
"
"[Aside] And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
"
"Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
[p]I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
[p]Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
[p]O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
[p]Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
[p]And full as much, for more there cannot be,
[p]I do detest false perjured Proteus.
[p]Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
"
"What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
[p]Would I not undergo for one calm look!
[p]O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
[p]When women cannot love where they're beloved!
"
"When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
[p]Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
[p]For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
[p]Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
[p]Descended into perjury, to love me.
[p]Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
[p]And that's far worse than none; better have none
[p]Than plural faith which is too much by one:
[p]Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
"
"In love
[p]Who respects friend?
"
"All men but Proteus.
"
"Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
[p]Can no way change you to a milder form,
[p]I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
[p]And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.
"
"O heaven!
"
"I'll force thee yield to my desire.
"
"Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
[p]Thou friend of an ill fashion!
"
"Valentine!
"
"Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
[p]For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
[p]Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
[p]Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
[p]I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
[p]Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
[p]Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
[p]I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
[p]But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
[p]The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
[p]'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
"
"My shame and guilt confounds me.
[p]Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
[p]Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
[p]I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
[p]As e'er I did commit.
"
"Then I am paid;
[p]And once again I do receive thee honest.
[p]Who by repentance is not satisfied
[p]Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
[p]By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
[p]And, that my love may appear plain and free,
[p]All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
"
"O me unhappy!
"
"Look to the boy.
"
"Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?
[p]Look up; speak.
"
"O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
[p]to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
"
"Where is that ring, boy?
"
"Here 'tis; this is it.
"
"How! let me see:
[p]Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
"
"O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
[p]This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
"
"But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
[p]I gave this unto Julia.
"
"And Julia herself did give it me;
[p]And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
"
"How! Julia!
"
"Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
[p]And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
[p]How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
[p]O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
[p]Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
[p]Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
[p]In a disguise of love:
[p]It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
[p]Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
"
"Than men their minds! 'tis true.
[p]O heaven! were man
[p]But constant, he were perfect. That one error
[p]Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
[p]Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
[p]What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
[p]More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
"
"Come, come, a hand from either:
[p]Let me be blest to make this happy close;
[p]'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
"
"Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.
"
"And I mine.
"
"A prize, a prize, a prize!
"
"Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.
[p]Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
[p]Banished Valentine.
"
"Sir Valentine!
"
"Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
"
"Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
[p]Come not within the measure of my wrath;
[p]Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
[p]Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
[p]Take but possession of her with a touch:
[p]I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
"
"Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
[p]I hold him but a fool that will endanger
[p]His body for a girl that loves him not:
[p]I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
"
"The more degenerate and base art thou,
[p]To make such means for her as thou hast done
[p]And leave her on such slight conditions.
[p]Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
[p]I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
[p]And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
[p]Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
[p]Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
[p]Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
[p]To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
[p]Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
[p]Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.
"
"I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
[p]I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
[p]To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.
"
"I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.
"
"These banish'd men that I have kept withal
[p]Are men endued with worthy qualities:
[p]Forgive them what they have committed here
[p]And let them be recall'd from their exile:
[p]They are reformed, civil, full of good
[p]And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
"
"Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:
[p]Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
[p]Come, let us go: we will include all jars
[p]With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.
"
"And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
[p]With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
[p]What think you of this page, my lord?
"
"I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
"
"I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
"
"What mean you by that saying?
"
"Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
[p]That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
[p]Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
[p]The story of your loves discovered:
[p]That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
[p]One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
"
"If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
[p]the like occasion whereon my services are now on
[p]foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
[p]difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
"
"I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
[p]means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
"
"Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
[p]justified in our loves; for indeed--
"
"Beseech you,--
"
"Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
[p]we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
[p]not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
[p]that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
[p]may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
[p]us.
"
"You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
"
"Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
[p]and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
"
"Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
[p]They were trained together in their childhoods; and
[p]there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
[p]which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
[p]more mature dignities and royal necessities made
[p]separation of their society, their encounters,
[p]though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
[p]with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
[p]embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
[p]though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
[p]embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
[p]winds. The heavens continue their loves!
"
"I think there is not in the world either malice or
[p]matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
[p]comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
[p]gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
[p]into my note.
"
"I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
[p]is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
[p]subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
[p]crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
[p]see him a man.
"
"Would they else be content to die?
"
"Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
[p]desire to live.
"
"If the king had no son, they would desire to live
[p]on crutches till he had one.
"
"Nine changes of the watery star hath been
[p]The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
[p]Without a burthen: time as long again
[p]Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
[p]And yet we should, for perpetuity,
[p]Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
[p]Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
[p]With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
[p]That go before it.
"
"Stay your thanks a while;
[p]And pay them when you part.
"
"Sir, that's to-morrow.
[p]I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
[p]Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
[p]No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
[p]'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
[p]To tire your royalty.
"
"We are tougher, brother,
[p]Than you can put us to't.
"
"No longer stay.
"
"One seven-night longer.
"
"Very sooth, to-morrow.
"
"We'll part the time between's then; and in that
[p]I'll no gainsaying.
"
"Press me not, beseech you, so.
[p]There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
[p]So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
[p]Were there necessity in your request, although
[p]'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
[p]Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
[p]Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
[p]To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
[p]Farewell, our brother.
"
"Tongue-tied, our queen?
[p]speak you.
"
"I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
[p]You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
[p]Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
[p]All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
[p]The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
[p]He's beat from his best ward.
"
"Well said, Hermione.
"
"To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
[p]But let him say so then, and let him go;
[p]But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
[p]We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
[p]Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
[p]The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
[p]You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
[p]To let him there a month behind the gest
[p]Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
[p]I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
[p]What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
"
"No, madam.
"
"Nay, but you will?
"
"I may not, verily.
"
"Verily!
[p]You put me off with limber vows; but I,
[p]Though you would seek to unsphere the
[p]stars with oaths,
[p]Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
[p]You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
[p]As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
[p]Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
[p]Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
[p]When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
[p]My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
[p]One of them you shall be.
"
"Your guest, then, madam:
[p]To be your prisoner should import offending;
[p]Which is for me less easy to commit
[p]Than you to punish.
"
"Not your gaoler, then,
[p]But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
[p]Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
[p]You were pretty lordings then?
"
"We were, fair queen,
[p]Two lads that thought there was no more behind
[p]But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
[p]And to be boy eternal.
"
"Was not my lord
[p]The verier wag o' the two?
"
"We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
[p]And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
[p]Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
[p]The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
[p]That any did. Had we pursued that life,
[p]And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
[p]With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
[p]Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
[p]Hereditary ours.
"
"By this we gather
[p]You have tripp'd since.
"
"O my most sacred lady!
[p]Temptations have since then been born to's; for
[p]In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
[p]Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
[p]Of my young play-fellow.
"
"Grace to boot!
[p]Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
[p]Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
[p]The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
[p]If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
[p]You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
[p]With any but with us.
"
"Is he won yet?
"
"He'll stay my lord.
"
"At my request he would not.
[p]Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
[p]To better purpose.
"
"Never?
"
"Never, but once.
"
"What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
[p]I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
[p]As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
[p]Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
[p]Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
[p]With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
[p]With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
[p]My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
[p]What was my first? it has an elder sister,
[p]Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
[p]But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
[p]Nay, let me have't; I long.
"
"Why, that was when
[p]Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
[p]Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
[p]And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
[p]'I am yours for ever.'
"
"'Tis grace indeed.
[p]Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
[p]The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
[p]The other for some while a friend.
"
"[Aside]. Too hot, too hot!
[p]To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
[p]I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
[p]But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
[p]May a free face put on, derive a liberty
[p]From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
[p]And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;
[p]But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
[p]As now they are, and making practised smiles,
[p]As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
[p]The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment
[p]My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
[p]Art thou my boy?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"I' fecks!
[p]Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
[p]smutch'd thy nose?
[p]They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
[p]We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
[p]And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
[p]Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
[p]Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
[p]Art thou my calf?
"
"Yes, if you will, my lord.
"
"Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
[p]To be full like me: yet they say we are
[p]Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
[p]That will say anything but were they false
[p]As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
[p]As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
[p]No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
[p]To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
[p]Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
[p]Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
[p]Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
[p]Thou dost make possible things not so held,
[p]Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
[p]With what's unreal thou coactive art,
[p]And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
[p]Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
[p]And that beyond commission, and I find it,
[p]And that to the infection of my brains
[p]And hardening of my brows.
"
"What means Sicilia?
"
"He something seems unsettled.
"
"How, my lord!
[p]What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?
"
"You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
[p]Are you moved, my lord?
"
"No, in good earnest.
[p]How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
[p]Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
[p]To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
[p]Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
[p]Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
[p]In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
[p]Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
[p]As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
[p]How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
[p]This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
[p]Will you take eggs for money?
"
"No, my lord, I'll fight.
"
"You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
[p]Are you so fond of your young prince as we
[p]Do seem to be of ours?
"
"If at home, sir,
[p]He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
[p]Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
[p]My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
[p]He makes a July's day short as December,
[p]And with his varying childness cures in me
[p]Thoughts that would thick my blood.
"
"So stands this squire
[p]Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
[p]And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
[p]How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
[p]Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
[p]Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
[p]Apparent to my heart.
"
"If you would seek us,
[p]We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
"
"To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
[p]Be you beneath the sky.
[p][Aside]
[p]I am angling now,
[p]Though you perceive me not how I give line.
[p]Go to, go to!
[p]How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
[p]And arms her with the boldness of a wife
[p]To her allowing husband!
[p][Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants]
[p]Gone already!
[p]Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
[p]ears a fork'd one!
[p]Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
[p]Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
[p]Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
[p]Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
[p]There have been,
[p]Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
[p]And many a man there is, even at this present,
[p]Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
[p]That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
[p]And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
[p]Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
[p]Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
[p]As mine, against their will. Should all despair
[p]That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
[p]Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
[p]It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
[p]Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
[p]From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
[p]No barricado for a belly; know't;
[p]It will let in and out the enemy
[p]With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
[p]Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
"
"I am like you, they say.
"
"Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
[p][Exit MAMILLIUS]
[p]Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
"
"You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
[p]When you cast out, it still came home.
"
"Didst note it?
"
"He would not stay at your petitions: made
[p]His business more material.
"
"Didst perceive it?
[p][Aside]
[p]They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
[p]'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
[p]When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
[p]That he did stay?
"
"At the good queen's entreaty.
"
"At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
[p]But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
[p]By any understanding pate but thine?
[p]For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
[p]More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
[p]But of the finer natures? by some severals
[p]Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
[p]Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
"
"Business, my lord! I think most understand
[p]Bohemia stays here longer.
"
"Ha!
"
"Stays here longer.
"
"Ay, but why?
"
"To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
[p]Of our most gracious mistress.
"
"Satisfy!
[p]The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
[p]Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
[p]With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
[p]My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
[p]Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
[p]Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
[p]Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
[p]In that which seems so.
"
"Be it forbid, my lord!
"
"To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
[p]If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
[p]Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
[p]From course required; or else thou must be counted
[p]A servant grafted in my serious trust
[p]And therein negligent; or else a fool
[p]That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
[p]And takest it all for jest.
"
"My gracious lord,
[p]I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
[p]In every one of these no man is free,
[p]But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
[p]Among the infinite doings of the world,
[p]Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
[p]If ever I were wilful-negligent,
[p]It was my folly; if industriously
[p]I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
[p]Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
[p]To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
[p]Where of the execution did cry out
[p]Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
[p]Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
[p]Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
[p]Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
[p]Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
[p]By its own visage: if I then deny it,
[p]'Tis none of mine.
"
"Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
[p]But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
[p]Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
[p]For to a vision so apparent rumour
[p]Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
[p]Resides not in that man that does not think,--
[p]My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
[p]Or else be impudently negative,
[p]To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
[p]My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
[p]As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
[p]Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
"
"I would not be a stander-by to hear
[p]My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
[p]My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
[p]You never spoke what did become you less
[p]Than this; which to reiterate were sin
[p]As deep as that, though true.
"
"Is whispering nothing?
[p]Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
[p]Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
[p]Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
[p]Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
[p]Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
[p]Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
[p]Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
[p]That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
[p]Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
[p]The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
[p]My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
[p]If this be nothing.
"
"Good my lord, be cured
[p]Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
[p]For 'tis most dangerous.
"
"Say it be, 'tis true.
"
"No, no, my lord.
"
"It is; you lie, you lie:
[p]I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
[p]Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
[p]Or else a hovering temporizer, that
[p]Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
[p]Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
[p]Infected as her life, she would not live
[p]The running of one glass.
"
"Who does infect her?
"
"Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
[p]About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
[p]Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
[p]To see alike mine honour as their profits,
[p]Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
[p]Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
[p]His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
[p]Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
[p]Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
[p]How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
[p]To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
[p]Which draught to me were cordial.
"
"Sir, my lord,
[p]I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
[p]But with a lingering dram that should not work
[p]Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
[p]Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
[p]So sovereignly being honourable.
[p]I have loved thee,--
"
"Make that thy question, and go rot!
[p]Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
[p]To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
[p]The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
[p]Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
[p]Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
[p]Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
[p]Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
[p]Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
[p]Could man so blench?
"
"I must believe you, sir:
[p]I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
[p]Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
[p]Will take again your queen as yours at first,
[p]Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
[p]The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
[p]Known and allied to yours.
"
"Thou dost advise me
[p]Even so as I mine own course have set down:
[p]I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
"
"My lord,
[p]Go then; and with a countenance as clear
[p]As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
[p]And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
[p]If from me he have wholesome beverage,
[p]Account me not your servant.
"
"This is all:
[p]Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
[p]Do't not, thou split'st thine own.
"
"I'll do't, my lord.
"
"I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
"
"O miserable lady! But, for me,
[p]What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
[p]Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
[p]Is the obedience to a master, one
[p]Who in rebellion with himself will have
[p]All that are his so too. To do this deed,
[p]Promotion follows. If I could find example
[p]Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
[p]And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
[p]Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
[p]Let villany itself forswear't. I must
[p]Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
[p]To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
[p]Here comes Bohemia.
"
"This is strange: methinks
[p]My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
[p]Good day, Camillo.
"
"Hail, most royal sir!
"
"What is the news i' the court?
"
"None rare, my lord.
"
"The king hath on him such a countenance
[p]As he had lost some province and a region
[p]Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
[p]With customary compliment; when he,
[p]Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
[p]A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
[p]So leaves me to consider what is breeding
[p]That changeth thus his manners.
"
"I dare not know, my lord.
"
"How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
[p]Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
[p]For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
[p]And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
[p]Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
[p]Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
[p]A party in this alteration, finding
[p]Myself thus alter'd with 't.
"
"There is a sickness
[p]Which puts some of us in distemper, but
[p]I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
[p]Of you that yet are well.
"
"How! caught of me!
[p]Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
[p]I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
[p]By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
[p]As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
[p]Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
[p]Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
[p]In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
[p]If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
[p]Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
[p]In ignorant concealment.
"
"I may not answer.
"
"A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
[p]I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
[p]I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
[p]Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
[p]Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
[p]What incidency thou dost guess of harm
[p]Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
[p]Which way to be prevented, if to be;
[p]If not, how best to bear it.
"
"Sir, I will tell you;
[p]Since I am charged in honour and by him
[p]That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
[p]Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
[p]I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
[p]Cry lost, and so good night!
"
"On, good Camillo.
"
"I am appointed him to murder you.
"
"By whom, Camillo?
"
"By the king.
"
"For what?
"
"He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
[p]As he had seen't or been an instrument
[p]To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
[p]Forbiddenly.
"
"O, then my best blood turn
[p]To an infected jelly and my name
[p]Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
[p]Turn then my freshest reputation to
[p]A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
[p]Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
[p]Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
[p]That e'er was heard or read!
"
"Swear his thought over
[p]By each particular star in heaven and
[p]By all their influences, you may as well
[p]Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
[p]As or by oath remove or counsel shake
[p]The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
[p]Is piled upon his faith and will continue
[p]The standing of his body.
"
"How should this grow?
"
"I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
[p]Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
[p]If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
[p]That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
[p]Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
[p]Your followers I will whisper to the business,
[p]And will by twos and threes at several posterns
[p]Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
[p]My fortunes to your service, which are here
[p]By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
[p]For, by the honour of my parents, I
[p]Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
[p]I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
[p]Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
[p]His execution sworn.
"
"I do believe thee:
[p]I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
[p]Be pilot to me and thy places shall
[p]Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
[p]My people did expect my hence departure
[p]Two days ago. This jealousy
[p]Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
[p]Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
[p]Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
[p]He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
[p]Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
[p]In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
[p]Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
[p]The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
[p]Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
[p]I will respect thee as a father if
[p]Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
"
"It is in mine authority to command
[p]The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
[p]To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.
"
"Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
[p]'Tis past enduring.
"
"Come, my gracious lord,
[p]Shall I be your playfellow?
"
"No, I'll none of you.
"
"Why, my sweet lord?
"
"You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
[p]I were a baby still. I love you better.
"
"And why so, my lord?
"
"Not for because
[p]Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
[p]Become some women best, so that there be not
[p]Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
[p]Or a half-moon made with a pen.
"
"Who taught you this?
"
"I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
[p]What colour are your eyebrows?
"
"Blue, my lord.
"
"Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
[p]That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
"
"Hark ye;
[p]The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
[p]Present our services to a fine new prince
[p]One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
[p]If we would have you.
"
"She is spread of late
[p]Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
"
"What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
[p]I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
[p]And tell 's a tale.
"
"Merry or sad shall't be?
"
"As merry as you will.
"
"A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
[p]Of sprites and goblins.
"
"Let's have that, good sir.
[p]Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
[p]To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.
"
"There was a man--
"
"Nay, come, sit down; then on.
"
"Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
[p]Yond crickets shall not hear it.
"
"Come on, then,
[p]And give't me in mine ear.
"
"Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
"
"Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
[p]Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
[p]Even to their ships.
"
"How blest am I
[p]In my just censure, in my true opinion!
[p]Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
[p]In being so blest! There may be in the cup
[p]A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
[p]And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
[p]Is not infected: but if one present
[p]The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
[p]How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
[p]With violent hefts. I have drunk,
[p]and seen the spider.
[p]Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
[p]There is a plot against my life, my crown;
[p]All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
[p]Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
[p]He has discover'd my design, and I
[p]Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
[p]For them to play at will. How came the posterns
[p]So easily open?
"
"By his great authority;
[p]Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
[p]On your command.
"
"I know't too well.
[p]Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
[p]Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
[p]Have too much blood in him.
"
"What is this? sport?
"
"Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
[p]Away with him! and let her sport herself
[p]With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
[p]Has made thee swell thus.
"
"But I'ld say he had not,
[p]And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
[p]Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
"
"You, my lords,
[p]Look on her, mark her well; be but about
[p]To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
[p]The justice of your bearts will thereto add
[p]'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
[p]Praise her but for this her without-door form,
[p]Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
[p]The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
[p]That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
[p]That mercy does, for calumny will sear
[p]Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
[p]When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
[p]Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
[p]From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
[p]She's an adulteress.
"
"Should a villain say so,
[p]The most replenish'd villain in the world,
[p]He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
[p]Do but mistake.
"
"You have mistook, my lady,
[p]Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
[p]Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
[p]Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
[p]Should a like language use to all degrees
[p]And mannerly distinguishment leave out
[p]Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
[p]She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
[p]More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
[p]A federary with her, and one that knows
[p]What she should shame to know herself
[p]But with her most vile principal, that she's
[p]A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
[p]That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
[p]To this their late escape.
"
"No, by my life.
[p]Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
[p]When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
[p]You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
[p]You scarce can right me throughly then to say
[p]You did mistake.
"
"No; if I mistake
[p]In those foundations which I build upon,
[p]The centre is not big enough to bear
[p]A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
[p]He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
[p]But that he speaks.
"
"There's some ill planet reigns:
[p]I must be patient till the heavens look
[p]With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
[p]I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
[p]Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
[p]Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
[p]That honourable grief lodged here which burns
[p]Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
[p]With thoughts so qualified as your charities
[p]Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
[p]The king's will be perform'd!
"
"Shall I be heard?
"
"Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
[p]My women may be with me; for you see
[p]My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
[p]There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
[p]Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
[p]As I come out: this action I now go on
[p]Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
[p]I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
[p]I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.
"
"Go, do our bidding; hence!
"
"Beseech your highness, call the queen again.
"
"Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
[p]Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
[p]Yourself, your queen, your son.
"
"For her, my lord,
[p]I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
[p]Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
[p]I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
[p]In this which you accuse her.
"
"If it prove
[p]She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
[p]I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
[p]Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
[p]For every inch of woman in the world,
[p]Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.
"
"Hold your peaces.
"
"Good my lord,--
"
"It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
[p]You are abused and by some putter-on
[p]That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
[p]I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
[p]I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
[p]The second and the third, nine, and some five;
[p]If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
[p]by mine honour,
[p]I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
[p]To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
[p]And I had rather glib myself than they
[p]Should not produce fair issue.
"
"Cease; no more.
[p]You smell this business with a sense as cold
[p]As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
[p]As you feel doing thus; and see withal
[p]The instruments that feel.
"
"If it be so,
[p]We need no grave to bury honesty:
[p]There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
[p]Of the whole dungy earth.
"
"What! lack I credit?
"
"I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
[p]Upon this ground; and more it would content me
[p]To have her honour true than your suspicion,
[p]Be blamed for't how you might.
"
"Why, what need we
[p]Commune with you of this, but rather follow
[p]Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
[p]Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
[p]Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
[p]Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
[p]Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
[p]We need no more of your advice: the matter,
[p]The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
[p]Properly ours.
"
"And I wish, my liege,
[p]You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
[p]Without more overture.
"
"How could that be?
[p]Either thou art most ignorant by age,
[p]Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
[p]Added to their familiarity,
[p]Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
[p]That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
[p]But only seeing, all other circumstances
[p]Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
[p]Yet, for a greater confirmation,
[p]For in an act of this importance 'twere
[p]Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
[p]To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
[p]Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
[p]Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
[p]They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
[p]Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
"
"Well done, my lord.
"
"Though I am satisfied and need no more
[p]Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
[p]Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
[p]Whose ignorant credulity will not
[p]Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
[p]From our free person she should be confined,
[p]Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
[p]Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
[p]We are to speak in public; for this business
[p]Will raise us all.
"
"[Aside]
[p]To laughter, as I take it,
[p]If the good truth were known.
"
"The keeper of the prison, call to him;
[p]let him have knowledge who I am.
[p][Exit Gentleman]
[p]Good lady,
[p]No court in Europe is too good for thee;
[p]What dost thou then in prison?
[p][Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler]
[p]Now, good sir,
[p]You know me, do you not?
"
"For a worthy lady
[p]And one whom much I honour.
"
"Pray you then,
[p]Conduct me to the queen.
"
"I may not, madam:
[p]To the contrary I have express commandment.
"
"Here's ado,
[p]To lock up honesty and honour from
[p]The access of gentle visitors!
[p]Is't lawful, pray you,
[p]To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
"
"So please you, madam,
[p]To put apart these your attendants, I
[p]Shall bring Emilia forth.
"
"I pray now, call her.
[p]Withdraw yourselves.
"
"And, madam,
[p]I must be present at your conference.
"
"Well, be't so, prithee.
[p][Exit Gaoler]
[p]Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
[p]As passes colouring.
[p][Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA]
[p]Dear gentlewoman,
[p]How fares our gracious lady?
"
"As well as one so great and so forlorn
[p]May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
[p]Which never tender lady hath born greater,
[p]She is something before her time deliver'd.
"
"A boy?
"
"A daughter, and a goodly babe,
[p]Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
[p]Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
[p]I am innocent as you.'
"
"I dare be sworn
[p]These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
[p]beshrew them!
[p]He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
[p]Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
[p]If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
[p]And never to my red-look'd anger be
[p]The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
[p]Commend my best obedience to the queen:
[p]If she dares trust me with her little babe,
[p]I'll show't the king and undertake to be
[p]Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
[p]How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
[p]The silence often of pure innocence
[p]Persuades when speaking fails.
"
"Most worthy madam,
[p]Your honour and your goodness is so evident
[p]That your free undertaking cannot miss
[p]A thriving issue: there is no lady living
[p]So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
[p]To visit the next room, I'll presently
[p]Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
[p]Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
[p]But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
[p]Lest she should be denied.
"
"Tell her, Emilia.
[p]I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
[p]As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
[p]I shall do good.
"
"Now be you blest for it!
[p]I'll to the queen: please you,
[p]come something nearer.
"
"Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
[p]I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
[p]Having no warrant.
"
"You need not fear it, sir:
[p]This child was prisoner to the womb and is
[p]By law and process of great nature thence
[p]Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
[p]The anger of the king nor guilty of,
[p]If any be, the trespass of the queen.
"
"I do believe it.
"
"Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
[p]I will stand betwixt you and danger.
"
"Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
[p]To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
[p]The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
[p]She the adulteress; for the harlot king
[p]Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
[p]And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
[p]I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
[p]Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
[p]Might come to me again. Who's there?
"
"My lord?
"
"How does the boy?
"
"He took good rest to-night;
[p]'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
"
"To see his nobleness!
[p]Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
[p]He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
[p]Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
[p]Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
[p]And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
[p]See how he fares.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p]Fie, fie! no thought of him:
[p]The thought of my revenges that way
[p]Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
[p]And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
[p]Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
[p]Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
[p]Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
[p]They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
[p]Shall she within my power.
"
"You must not enter.
"
"Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
[p]Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
[p]Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
[p]More free than he is jealous.
"
"That's enough.
"
"Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
[p]None should come at him.
"
"Not so hot, good sir:
[p]I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
[p]That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
[p]At each his needless heavings, such as you
[p]Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
[p]Do come with words as medicinal as true,
[p]Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
[p]That presses him from sleep.
"
"What noise there, ho?
"
"No noise, my lord; but needful conference
[p]About some gossips for your highness.
"
"How!
[p]Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
[p]I charged thee that she should not come about me:
[p]I knew she would.
"
"I told her so, my lord,
[p]On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
[p]She should not visit you.
"
"What, canst not rule her?
"
"From all dishonesty he can: in this,
[p]Unless he take the course that you have done,
[p]Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
[p]He shall not rule me.
"
"La you now, you hear:
[p]When she will take the rein I let her run;
[p]But she'll not stumble.
"
"Good my liege, I come;
[p]And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
[p]Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
[p]Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
[p]Less appear so in comforting your evils,
[p]Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
[p]From your good queen.
"
"Good queen!
"
"Good queen, my lord,
[p]Good queen; I say good queen;
[p]And would by combat make her good, so were I
[p]A man, the worst about you.
"
"Force her hence.
"
"Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
[p]First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
[p]But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
[p]For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
[p]Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
"
"Out!
[p]A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
[p]A most intelligencing bawd!
"
"Not so:
[p]I am as ignorant in that as you
[p]In so entitling me, and no less honest
[p]Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
[p]As this world goes, to pass for honest.
"
"Traitors!
[p]Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
[p]Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
[p]By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
[p]Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
"
"For ever
[p]Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
[p]Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
[p]Which he has put upon't!
"
"He dreads his wife.
"
"So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
[p]You'ld call your children yours.
"
"A nest of traitors!
"
"I am none, by this good light.
"
"Nor I, nor any
[p]But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
[p]The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
[p]His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
[p]Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
[p]and will not--
[p]For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
[p]He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
[p]The root of his opinion, which is rotten
[p]As ever oak or stone was sound.
"
"A callat
[p]Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
[p]And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
[p]It is the issue of Polixenes:
[p]Hence with it, and together with the dam
[p]Commit them to the fire!
"
"It is yours;
[p]And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
[p]So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
[p]Although the print be little, the whole matter
[p]And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
[p]The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
[p]The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
[p]His smiles,
[p]The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
[p]And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
[p]So like to him that got it, if thou hast
[p]The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
[p]No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
[p]Her children not her husband's!
"
"A gross hag
[p]And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
[p]That wilt not stay her tongue.
"
"Hang all the husbands
[p]That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
[p]Hardly one subject.
"
"Once more, take her hence.
"
"A most unworthy and unnatural lord
[p]Can do no more.
"
"I'll ha' thee burnt.
"
"I care not:
[p]It is an heretic that makes the fire,
[p]Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
[p]But this most cruel usage of your queen,
[p]Not able to produce more accusation
[p]Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
[p]Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
[p]Yea, scandalous to the world.
"
"On your allegiance,
[p]Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
[p]Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
[p]If she did know me one. Away with her!
"
"I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
[p]Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
[p]Jove send her
[p]A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
[p]You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
[p]Will never do him good, not one of you.
[p]So, so: farewell; we are gone.
"
"Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
[p]My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
[p]A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
[p]And see it instantly consumed with fire;
[p]Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
[p]Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
[p]And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
[p]With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
[p]And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
[p]The bastard brains with these my proper hands
[p]Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
[p]For thou set'st on thy wife.
"
"I did not, sir:
[p]These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
[p]Can clear me in't.
"
"We can: my royal liege,
[p]He is not guilty of her coming hither.
"
"You're liars all.
"
"Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
[p]We have always truly served you, and beseech you
[p]So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
[p]As recompense of our dear services
[p]Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
[p]Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
[p]Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
"
"I am a feather for each wind that blows:
[p]Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
[p]And call me father? better burn it now
[p]Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
[p]It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
[p]You that have been so tenderly officious
[p]With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
[p]To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
[p]So sure as this beard's grey,
[p]--what will you adventure
[p]To save this brat's life?
"
"Any thing, my lord,
[p]That my ability may undergo
[p]And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
[p]I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
[p]To save the innocent: any thing possible.
"
"It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
[p]Thou wilt perform my bidding.
"
"I will, my lord.
"
"Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
[p]Of any point in't shall not only be
[p]Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
[p]Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
[p]As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
[p]This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
[p]To some remote and desert place quite out
[p]Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
[p]Without more mercy, to its own protection
[p]And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
[p]It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
[p]On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
[p]That thou commend it strangely to some place
[p]Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
"
"I swear to do this, though a present death
[p]Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
[p]Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
[p]To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
[p]Casting their savageness aside have done
[p]Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
[p]In more than this deed does require! And blessing
[p]Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
[p]Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!
"
"No, I'll not rear
[p]Another's issue.
"
"Please your highness, posts
[p]From those you sent to the oracle are come
[p]An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
[p]Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
[p]Hasting to the court.
"
"So please you, sir, their speed
[p]Hath been beyond account.
"
"Twenty-three days
[p]They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
[p]The great Apollo suddenly will have
[p]The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
[p]Summon a session, that we may arraign
[p]Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
[p]Been publicly accused, so shall she have
[p]A just and open trial. While she lives
[p]My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
[p]And think upon my bidding.
"
"The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
[p]Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
[p]The common praise it bears.
"
"I shall report,
[p]For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
[p]Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
[p]Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
[p]How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
[p]It was i' the offering!
"
"But of all, the burst
[p]And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
[p]Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
[p]That I was nothing.
"
"If the event o' the journey
[p]Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
[p]As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
[p]The time is worth the use on't.
"
"Great Apollo
[p]Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
[p]So forcing faults upon Hermione,
[p]I little like.
"
"The violent carriage of it
[p]Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
[p]Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
[p]Shall the contents discover, something rare
[p]Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
[p]And gracious be the issue!
"
"This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
[p]Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
[p]The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
[p]Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
[p]Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
[p]Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
[p]Even to the guilt or the purgation.
[p]Produce the prisoner.
"
"It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
[p]Appear in person here in court. Silence!
[p][Enter HERMIONE guarded;]
[p]PAULINA and Ladies attending]
"
"Read the indictment.
"
"[Reads] Hermione, queen to the worthy
[p]Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and
[p]arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery
[p]with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring
[p]with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
[p]lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence
[p]whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,
[p]thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance
[p]of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for
[p]their better safety, to fly away by night.
"
"Since what I am to say must be but that
[p]Which contradicts my accusation and
[p]The testimony on my part no other
[p]But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
[p]To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
[p]Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
[p]Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
[p]Behold our human actions, as they do,
[p]I doubt not then but innocence shall make
[p]False accusation blush and tyranny
[p]Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
[p]Who least will seem to do so, my past life
[p]Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
[p]As I am now unhappy; which is more
[p]Than history can pattern, though devised
[p]And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
[p]A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
[p]A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
[p]The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
[p]To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
[p]Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
[p]As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
[p]'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
[p]And only that I stand for. I appeal
[p]To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
[p]Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
[p]How merited to be so; since he came,
[p]With what encounter so uncurrent I
[p]Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
[p]The bound of honour, or in act or will
[p]That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
[p]Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
[p]Cry fie upon my grave!
"
"I ne'er heard yet
[p]That any of these bolder vices wanted
[p]Less impudence to gainsay what they did
[p]Than to perform it first.
"
"That's true enough;
[p]Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
"
"You will not own it.
"
"More than mistress of
[p]Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
[p]At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
[p]With whom I am accused, I do confess
[p]I loved him as in honour he required,
[p]With such a kind of love as might become
[p]A lady like me, with a love even such,
[p]So and no other, as yourself commanded:
[p]Which not to have done I think had been in me
[p]Both disobedience and ingratitude
[p]To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
[p]Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
[p]That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
[p]I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
[p]For me to try how: all I know of it
[p]Is that Camillo was an honest man;
[p]And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
[p]Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
"
"You knew of his departure, as you know
[p]What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
"
"Sir,
[p]You speak a language that I understand not:
[p]My life stands in the level of your dreams,
[p]Which I'll lay down.
"
"Your actions are my dreams;
[p]You had a bastard by Polixenes,
[p]And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
[p]Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
[p]Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
[p]Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
[p]No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
[p]More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
[p]Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
[p]Look for no less than death.
"
"Sir, spare your threats:
[p]The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
[p]To me can life be no commodity:
[p]The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
[p]I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
[p]But know not how it went. My second joy
[p]And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
[p]I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
[p]Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
[p]The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
[p]Haled out to murder: myself on every post
[p]Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
[p]The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
[p]To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
[p]Here to this place, i' the open air, before
[p]I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
[p]Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
[p]That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
[p]But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
[p]I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
[p]Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
[p]Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
[p]But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
[p]'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
[p]I do refer me to the oracle:
[p]Apollo be my judge!
"
"This your request
[p]Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
[p]And in Apollos name, his oracle.
"
"The Emperor of Russia was my father:
[p]O that he were alive, and here beholding
[p]His daughter's trial! that he did but see
[p]The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
[p]Of pity, not revenge!
"
"You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
[p]That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
[p]Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
[p]The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
[p]Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
[p]You have not dared to break the holy seal
[p]Nor read the secrets in't.
"
"[with Dion] All this we swear.
"
"Break up the seals and read.
"
"[Reads]. Hermione is chaste;
[p]Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes
[p]a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;
[p]and the king shall live without an heir, if that
[p]which is lost be not found.
"
"Now blessed be the great Apollo!
"
"Praised!
"
"Hast thou read truth?
"
"Ay, my lord; even so
[p]As it is here set down.
"
"There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
[p]The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
"
"My lord the king, the king!
"
"What is the business?
"
"O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
[p]The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
[p]Of the queen's speed, is gone.
"
"How! gone!
"
"Is dead.
"
"Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
[p]Do strike at my injustice.
[p][HERMIONE swoons]
[p]How now there!
"
"This news is mortal to the queen: look down
[p]And see what death is doing.
"
"Take her hence:
[p]Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
[p]I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
[p]Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
[p]Some remedies for life.
[p][Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE]
[p]Apollo, pardon
[p]My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
[p]I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
[p]New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
[p]Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
[p]For, being transported by my jealousies
[p]To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
[p]Camillo for the minister to poison
[p]My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
[p]But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
[p]My swift command, though I with death and with
[p]Reward did threaten and encourage him,
[p]Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
[p]And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
[p]Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
[p]Which you knew great, and to the hazard
[p]Of all encertainties himself commended,
[p]No richer than his honour: how he glisters
[p]Thorough my rust! and how his pity
[p]Does my deeds make the blacker!
"
"Woe the while!
[p]O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
[p]Break too.
"
"What fit is this, good lady?
"
"What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
[p]What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
[p]In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
[p]Must I receive, whose every word deserves
[p]To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
[p]Together working with thy jealousies,
[p]Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
[p]For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
[p]And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
[p]Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
[p]That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
[p]That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
[p]And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
[p]Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
[p]To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
[p]More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
[p]The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
[p]To be or none or little; though a devil
[p]Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
[p]Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
[p]Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
[p]Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
[p]That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
[p]Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
[p]Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
[p]When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
[p]The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
[p]and vengeance for't
[p]Not dropp'd down yet.
"
"The higher powers forbid!
"
"I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
[p]Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
[p]Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
[p]Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
[p]As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
[p]Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
[p]Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
[p]To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
[p]Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
[p]Upon a barren mountain and still winter
[p]In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
[p]To look that way thou wert.
"
"Go on, go on
[p]Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
[p]All tongues to talk their bitterest.
"
"Say no more:
[p]Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
[p]I' the boldness of your speech.
"
"I am sorry for't:
[p]All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
[p]I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
[p]The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
[p]To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
[p]Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
[p]At my petition; I beseech you, rather
[p]Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
[p]Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
[p]Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
[p]The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
[p]I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
[p]I'll not remember you of my own lord,
[p]Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
[p]And I'll say nothing.
"
"Thou didst speak but well
[p]When most the truth; which I receive much better
[p]Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
[p]To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
[p]One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
[p]The causes of their death appear, unto
[p]Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
[p]The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
[p]Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
[p]Will bear up with this exercise, so long
[p]I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
[p]Unto these sorrows.
"
"Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
[p]The deserts of Bohemia?
"
"Ay, my lord: and fear
[p]We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
[p]And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
[p]The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
[p]And frown upon 's.
"
"Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
[p]Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
[p]I call upon thee.
"
"Make your best haste, and go not
[p]Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
[p]Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
[p]Of prey that keep upon't.
"
"Go thou away:
[p]I'll follow instantly.
"
"I am glad at heart
[p]To be so rid o' the business.
"
"Come, poor babe:
[p]I have heard, but not believed,
[p]the spirits o' the dead
[p]May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
[p]Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
[p]So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
[p]Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
[p]I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
[p]So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
[p]Like very sanctity, she did approach
[p]My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
[p]And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
[p]Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
[p]Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
[p]Since fate, against thy better disposition,
[p]Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
[p]Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
[p]Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
[p]There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
[p]Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
[p]I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
[p]Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
[p]Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
[p]She melted into air. Affrighted much,
[p]I did in time collect myself and thought
[p]This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
[p]Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
[p]I will be squared by this. I do believe
[p]Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
[p]Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
[p]Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
[p]Either for life or death, upon the earth
[p]Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
[p]There lie, and there thy character: there these;
[p]Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
[p]And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
[p]That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
[p]To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
[p]But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
[p]To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
[p]The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
[p]A lullaby too rough: I never saw
[p]The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
[p]Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
[p]I am gone for ever.
"
"I would there were no age between sixteen and
[p]three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
[p]rest; for there is nothing in the between but
[p]getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
[p]stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
[p]these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
[p]hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
[p]best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
[p]than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
[p]the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
[p]will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
[p]pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
[p]pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
[p]though I am not bookish, yet I can read
[p]waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
[p]some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
[p]behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
[p]than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
[p]pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
[p]but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!
"
"Hilloa, loa!
"
"What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
[p]on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
[p]ailest thou, man?
"
"I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
[p]but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
[p]sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
[p]a bodkin's point.
"
"Why, boy, how is it?
"
"I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
[p]how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
[p]point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
[p]sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
[p]ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
[p]swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
[p]cork into a hogshead. And then for the
[p]land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
[p]shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
[p]his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
[p]end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
[p]it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
[p]sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
[p]and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
[p]the sea or weather.
"
"Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
"
"Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
[p]sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
[p]the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
[p]now.
"
"Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!
"
"I would you had been by the ship side, to have
[p]helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
"
"Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
[p]boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
[p]dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
[p]thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
[p]child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;
[p]open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
[p]rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
[p]open't. What's within, boy?
"
"You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
[p]are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!
"
"This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
[p]with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
[p]We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
[p]nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
[p]boy, the next way home.
"
"Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
[p]if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
[p]he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
[p]are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
[p]it.
"
"That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
[p]which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
[p]sight of him.
"
"Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.
"
"'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.
"
"I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
[p]Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
[p]Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
[p]To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
[p]To me or my swift passage, that I slide
[p]O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
[p]Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
[p]To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
[p]To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
[p]The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
[p]Or what is now received: I witness to
[p]The times that brought them in; so shall I do
[p]To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
[p]The glistering of this present, as my tale
[p]Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
[p]I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
[p]As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
[p]The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
[p]That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
[p]Gentle spectators, that I now may be
[p]In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
[p]I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
[p]I now name to you; and with speed so pace
[p]To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
[p]Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
[p]I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
[p]Be known when 'tis brought forth.
[p]A shepherd's daughter,
[p]And what to her adheres, which follows after,
[p]Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
[p]If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
[p]If never, yet that Time himself doth say
[p]He wishes earnestly you never may.
"
"I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
[p]'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
[p]grant this.
"
"It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
[p]I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
[p]desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
[p]king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
[p]sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
[p]think so, which is another spur to my departure.
"
"As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
[p]thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
[p]thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
[p]have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
[p]made me businesses which none without thee can
[p]sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
[p]them thyself or take away with thee the very
[p]services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
[p]considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
[p]thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
[p]therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
[p]country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
[p]naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
[p]penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
[p]my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
[p]and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
[p]Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
[p]son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
[p]being gracious, than they are in losing them when
[p]they have approved their virtues.
"
"Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
[p]his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
[p]have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
[p]from court and is less frequent to his princely
[p]exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
"
"I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
[p]care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
[p]look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
[p]intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
[p]most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
[p]very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
[p]neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.
"
"I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
[p]daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
[p]extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.
"
"That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
[p]fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
[p]shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
[p]appearing what we are, have some question with the
[p]shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
[p]uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
[p]Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
[p]lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
"
"I willingly obey your command.
"
"My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.
"
"When daffodils begin to peer,
[p]With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
[p]Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
[p]For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
[p]The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
[p]With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
[p]Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
[p]For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
[p]The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
[p]With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
[p]Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
[p]While we lie tumbling in the hay.
[p]I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
[p]wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
[p]But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
[p]The pale moon shines by night:
[p]And when I wander here and there,
[p]I then do most go right.
[p]If tinkers may have leave to live,
[p]And bear the sow-skin budget,
[p]Then my account I well may, give,
[p]And in the stocks avouch it.
[p]My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
[p]lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
[p]being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
[p]a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
[p]drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
[p]the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
[p]on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
[p]me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
[p]of it. A prize! a prize!
"
"Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
[p]yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
[p]shorn. what comes the wool to?
"
"[Aside]
[p]If the springe hold, the cock's mine.
"
"I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
[p]I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
[p]of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
[p]this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
[p]hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
[p]on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
[p]the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
[p]ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
[p]one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
[p]horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
[p]pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
[p]nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
[p]may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
[p]raisins o' the sun.
"
"O that ever I was born!
"
"I' the name of me--
"
"O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
[p]then, death, death!
"
"Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
[p]on thee, rather than have these off.
"
"O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
[p]than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
[p]ones and millions.
"
"Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
[p]great matter.
"
"I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
[p]ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
[p]me.
"
"What, by a horseman, or a footman?
"
"A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
"
"Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
[p]has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
[p]it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
[p]I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.
"
"O, good sir, tenderly, O!
"
"Alas, poor soul!
"
"O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
[p]shoulder-blade is out.
"
"How now! canst stand?
"
"[Picking his pocket]
[p]Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me
[p]a charitable office.
"
"Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
"
"No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
[p]a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
[p]unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
[p]any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
[p]that kills my heart.
"
"What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
"
"A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
[p]troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
[p]prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
[p]virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.
"
"His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
[p]out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
[p]there; and yet it will no more but abide.
"
"Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
[p]hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
[p]process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
[p]motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
[p]wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
[p]and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
[p]settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.
"
"Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
[p]wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.
"
"Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
[p]put me into this apparel.
"
"Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
[p]but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.
"
"I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
[p]false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
[p]him.
"
"How do you now?
"
"Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
[p]walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
[p]softly towards my kinsman's.
"
"Shall I bring thee on the way?
"
"No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.
"
"Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
[p]sheep-shearing.
"
"Prosper you, sweet sir!
[p][Exit Clown]
[p]Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
[p]I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
[p]make not this cheat bring out another and the
[p]shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
[p]put in the book of virtue!
[p][Sings]
[p]Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
[p]And merrily hent the stile-a:
[p]A merry heart goes all the day,
[p]Your sad tires in a mile-a.
"
"These your unusual weeds to each part of you
[p]Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
[p]Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
[p]Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
[p]And you the queen on't.
"
"Sir, my gracious lord,
[p]To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
[p]O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
[p]The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
[p]With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
[p]Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
[p]In every mess have folly and the feeders
[p]Digest it with a custom, I should blush
[p]To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
[p]To show myself a glass.
"
"I bless the time
[p]When my good falcon made her flight across
[p]Thy father's ground.
"
"Now Jove afford you cause!
[p]To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
[p]Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
[p]To think your father, by some accident,
[p]Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
[p]How would he look, to see his work so noble
[p]Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
[p]Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
[p]The sternness of his presence?
"
"Apprehend
[p]Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
[p]Humbling their deities to love, have taken
[p]The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
[p]Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
[p]A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
[p]Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
[p]As I seem now. Their transformations
[p]Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
[p]Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
[p]Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
[p]Burn hotter than my faith.
"
"O, but, sir,
[p]Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
[p]Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
[p]One of these two must be necessities,
[p]Which then will speak, that you must
[p]change this purpose,
[p]Or I my life.
"
"Thou dearest Perdita,
[p]With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
[p]The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
[p]Or not my father's. For I cannot be
[p]Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
[p]I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
[p]Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
[p]Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
[p]That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
[p]Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
[p]Of celebration of that nuptial which
[p]We two have sworn shall come.
"
"O lady Fortune,
[p]Stand you auspicious!
"
"See, your guests approach:
[p]Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
[p]And let's be red with mirth.
[p][Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and]
[p]others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised]
"
"Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
[p]This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
[p]Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
[p]Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
[p]At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
[p]On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
[p]With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
[p]She would to each one sip. You are retired,
[p]As if you were a feasted one and not
[p]The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
[p]These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
[p]A way to make us better friends, more known.
[p]Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
[p]That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
[p]And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
[p]As your good flock shall prosper.
"
"[To POLIXENES] Sir, welcome:
[p]It is my father's will I should take on me
[p]The hostess-ship o' the day.
[p][To CAMILLO]
[p]You're welcome, sir.
[p]Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
[p]For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
[p]Seeming and savour all the winter long:
[p]Grace and remembrance be to you both,
[p]And welcome to our shearing!
"
"Shepherdess,
[p]A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
[p]With flowers of winter.
"
"Sir, the year growing ancient,
[p]Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
[p]Of trembling winter, the fairest
[p]flowers o' the season
[p]Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
[p]Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
[p]Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
[p]To get slips of them.
"
"Wherefore, gentle maiden,
[p]Do you neglect them?
"
"For I have heard it said
[p]There is an art which in their piedness shares
[p]With great creating nature.
"
"Say there be;
[p]Yet nature is made better by no mean
[p]But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
[p]Which you say adds to nature, is an art
[p]That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
[p]A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
[p]And make conceive a bark of baser kind
[p]By bud of nobler race: this is an art
[p]Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
[p]The art itself is nature.
"
"So it is.
"
"Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
[p]And do not call them bastards.
"
"I'll not put
[p]The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
[p]No more than were I painted I would wish
[p]This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
[p]Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
[p]Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
[p]The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
[p]And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
[p]Of middle summer, and I think they are given
[p]To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
"
"I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
[p]And only live by gazing.
"
"Out, alas!
[p]You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
[p]Would blow you through and through.
[p]Now, my fair'st friend,
[p]I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
[p]Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
[p]That wear upon your virgin branches yet
[p]Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
[p]For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
[p]From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
[p]That come before the swallow dares, and take
[p]The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
[p]But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
[p]Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
[p]That die unmarried, ere they can behold
[p]Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
[p]Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
[p]The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
[p]The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
[p]To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
[p]To strew him o'er and o'er!
"
"What, like a corse?
"
"No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
[p]Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
[p]But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
[p]Methinks I play as I have seen them do
[p]In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
[p]Does change my disposition.
"
"What you do
[p]Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
[p]I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
[p]I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
[p]Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
[p]To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
[p]A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
[p]Nothing but that; move still, still so,
[p]And own no other function: each your doing,
[p]So singular in each particular,
[p]Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
[p]That all your acts are queens.
"
"O Doricles,
[p]Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
[p]And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
[p]Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
[p]With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
[p]You woo'd me the false way.
"
"I think you have
[p]As little skill to fear as I have purpose
[p]To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
[p]Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
[p]That never mean to part.
"
"I'll swear for 'em.
"
"This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
[p]Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
[p]But smacks of something greater than herself,
[p]Too noble for this place.
"
"He tells her something
[p]That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
[p]The queen of curds and cream.
"
"Come on, strike up!
"
"Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
[p]To mend her kissing with!
"
"Now, in good time!
"
"Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
[p]Come, strike up!
[p][Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and]
[p]Shepherdesses]
"
"Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
[p]Which dances with your daughter?
"
"They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
[p]To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
[p]Upon his own report and I believe it;
[p]He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
[p]I think so too; for never gazed the moon
[p]Upon the water as he'll stand and read
[p]As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
[p]I think there is not half a kiss to choose
[p]Who loves another best.
"
"She dances featly.
"
"So she does any thing; though I report it,
[p]That should be silent: if young Doricles
[p]Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
[p]Which he not dreams of.
"
"O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
[p]door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
[p]pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
[p]several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
[p]utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
[p]ears grew to his tunes.
"
"He could never come better; he shall come in. I
[p]love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
[p]matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
[p]indeed and sung lamentably.
"
"He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
[p]milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
[p]has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
[p]bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
[p]burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
[p]her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
[p]as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
[p]the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
[p]no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
[p]'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'
"
"This is a brave fellow.
"
"Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
[p]fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?
"
"He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
[p]points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
[p]learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
[p]gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
[p]sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
[p]would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
[p]to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
"
"Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
"
"Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.
"
"You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
[p]than you'ld think, sister.
"
"Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
"
"Lawn as white as driven snow;
[p]Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
[p]Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
[p]Masks for faces and for noses;
[p]Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
[p]Perfume for a lady's chamber;
[p]Golden quoifs and stomachers,
[p]For my lads to give their dears:
[p]Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
[p]What maids lack from head to heel:
[p]Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
[p]Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.
"
"If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
[p]no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
[p]will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
"
"I was promised them against the feast; but they come
[p]not too late now.
"
"He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
"
"He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
[p]paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.
"
"Is there no manners left among maids? will they
[p]wear their plackets where they should bear their
[p]faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
[p]going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
[p]secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
[p]our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
[p]your tongues, and not a word more.
"
"I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
[p]and a pair of sweet gloves.
"
"Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
[p]and lost all my money?
"
"And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
[p]therefore it behoves men to be wary.
"
"Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.
"
"I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.
"
"What hast here? ballads?
"
"Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
[p]life, for then we are sure they are true.
"
"Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
[p]wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
[p]burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
[p]toads carbonadoed.
"
"Is it true, think you?
"
"Very true, and but a month old.
"
"Bless me from marrying a usurer!
"
"Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
[p]Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
[p]present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
"
"Pray you now, buy it.
"
"Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
[p]ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.
"
"Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
[p]the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
[p]forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
[p]ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
[p]thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
[p]fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
[p]loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.
"
"Is it true too, think you?
"
"Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
[p]my pack will hold.
"
"Lay it by too: another.
"
"This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
"
"Let's have some merry ones.
"
"Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
[p]the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
[p]scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
[p]request, I can tell you.
"
"We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
[p]shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.
"
"We had the tune on't a month ago.
"
"I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
[p]occupation; have at it with you.
"
"Get you hence, for I must go
[p]Where it fits not you to know.
"
"Whither?
"
"O, whither?
"
"Whither?
"
"It becomes thy oath full well,
[p]Thou to me thy secrets tell.
"
"Me too, let me go thither.
"
"Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
"
"If to either, thou dost ill.
"
"Neither.
"
"What, neither?
"
"Neither.
"
"Thou hast sworn my love to be.
"
"Thou hast sworn it more to me:
[p]Then whither goest? say, whither?
"
"We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
[p]father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
[p]not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
[p]me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
[p]have the first choice. Follow me, girls.
"
"And you shall pay well for 'em.
[p][Follows singing]
[p]Will you buy any tape,
[p]Or lace for your cape,
[p]My dainty duck, my dear-a?
[p]Any silk, any thread,
[p]Any toys for your head,
[p]Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
[p]Come to the pedlar;
[p]Money's a medler.
[p]That doth utter all men's ware-a.
"
"Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
[p]three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
[p]themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
[p]Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
[p]say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
[p]not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
[p]be not too rough for some that know little but
[p]bowling, it will please plentifully.
"
"Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
[p]homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.
"
"You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
[p]these four threes of herdsmen.
"
"One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
[p]danced before the king; and not the worst of the
[p]three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
"
"Leave your prating: since these good men are
[p]pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.
"
"Why, they stay at door, sir.
"
"O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
[p][To CAMILLO]
[p]Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
[p]He's simple and tells much.
[p][To FLORIZEL]
[p]How now, fair shepherd!
[p]Your heart is full of something that does take
[p]Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
[p]And handed love as you do, I was wont
[p]To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
[p]The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
[p]To her acceptance; you have let him go
[p]And nothing marted with him. If your lass
[p]Interpretation should abuse and call this
[p]Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
[p]For a reply, at least if you make a care
[p]Of happy holding her.
"
"Old sir, I know
[p]She prizes not such trifles as these are:
[p]The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
[p]Up in my heart; which I have given already,
[p]But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
[p]Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
[p]Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
[p]As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
[p]Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
[p]snow that's bolted
[p]By the northern blasts twice o'er.
"
"What follows this?
[p]How prettily the young swain seems to wash
[p]The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
[p]But to your protestation; let me hear
[p]What you profess.
"
"Do, and be witness to 't.
"
"And this my neighbour too?
"
"And he, and more
[p]Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
[p]That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
[p]Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
[p]That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
[p]More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
[p]Without her love; for her employ them all;
[p]Commend them and condemn them to her service
[p]Or to their own perdition.
"
"Fairly offer'd.
"
"This shows a sound affection.
"
"But, my daughter,
[p]Say you the like to him?
"
"I cannot speak
[p]So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
[p]By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
[p]The purity of his.
"
"Take hands, a bargain!
[p]And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
[p]I give my daughter to him, and will make
[p]Her portion equal his.
"
"O, that must be
[p]I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
[p]I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
[p]Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
[p]Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
"
"Come, your hand;
[p]And, daughter, yours.
"
"Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
[p]Have you a father?
"
"I have: but what of him?
"
"Knows he of this?
"
"He neither does nor shall.
"
"Methinks a father
[p]Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
[p]That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
[p]Is not your father grown incapable
[p]Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
[p]With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
[p]Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
[p]Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
[p]But what he did being childish?
"
"No, good sir;
[p]He has his health and ampler strength indeed
[p]Than most have of his age.
"
"By my white beard,
[p]You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
[p]Something unfilial: reason my son
[p]Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
[p]The father, all whose joy is nothing else
[p]But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
[p]In such a business.
"
"I yield all this;
[p]But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
[p]Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
[p]My father of this business.
"
"Let him know't.
"
"He shall not.
"
"Prithee, let him.
"
"No, he must not.
"
"Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
[p]At knowing of thy choice.
"
"Come, come, he must not.
[p]Mark our contract.
"
"Mark your divorce, young sir,
[p][Discovering himself]
[p]Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
[p]To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
[p]That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
[p]I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
[p]But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
[p]Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
[p]The royal fool thou copest with,--
"
"O, my heart!
"
"I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
[p]More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
[p]If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
[p]That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
[p]I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
[p]Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
[p]Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
[p]Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
[p]Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
[p]From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
[p]Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
[p]That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
[p]Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
[p]These rural latches to his entrance open,
[p]Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
[p]I will devise a death as cruel for thee
[p]As thou art tender to't.
"
"Even here undone!
[p]I was not much afeard; for once or twice
[p]I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
[p]The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
[p]Hides not his visage from our cottage but
[p]Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
[p]I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
[p]Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
[p]Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
[p]But milk my ewes and weep.
"
"Why, how now, father!
[p]Speak ere thou diest.
"
"I cannot speak, nor think
[p]Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
[p]You have undone a man of fourscore three,
[p]That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
[p]To die upon the bed my father died,
[p]To lie close by his honest bones: but now
[p]Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
[p]Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
[p]That knew'st this was the prince,
[p]and wouldst adventure
[p]To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
[p]If I might die within this hour, I have lived
[p]To die when I desire.
"
"Why look you so upon me?
[p]I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
[p]But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
[p]More straining on for plucking back, not following
[p]My leash unwillingly.
"
"Gracious my lord,
[p]You know your father's temper: at this time
[p]He will allow no speech, which I do guess
[p]You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
[p]Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
[p]Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
[p]Come not before him.
"
"I not purpose it.
[p]I think, Camillo?
"
"Even he, my lord.
"
"How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
[p]How often said, my dignity would last
[p]But till 'twere known!
"
"It cannot fail but by
[p]The violation of my faith; and then
[p]Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
[p]And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
[p]From my succession wipe me, father; I
[p]Am heir to my affection.
"
"Be advised.
"
"I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
[p]Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
[p]If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
[p]Do bid it welcome.
"
"This is desperate, sir.
"
"So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
[p]I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
[p]Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
[p]Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
[p]The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
[p]In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
[p]To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
[p]As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
[p]When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
[p]To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
[p]Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
[p]Tug for the time to come. This you may know
[p]And so deliver, I am put to sea
[p]With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
[p]And most opportune to our need I have
[p]A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
[p]For this design. What course I mean to hold
[p]Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
[p]Concern me the reporting.
"
"O my lord!
[p]I would your spirit were easier for advice,
[p]Or stronger for your need.
"
"Hark, Perdita
[p][Drawing her aside]
[p]I'll hear you by and by.
"
"He's irremoveable,
[p]Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
[p]His going I could frame to serve my turn,
[p]Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
[p]Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
[p]And that unhappy king, my master, whom
[p]I so much thirst to see.
"
"Now, good Camillo;
[p]I am so fraught with curious business that
[p]I leave out ceremony.
"
"Sir, I think
[p]You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
[p]That I have borne your father?
"
"Very nobly
[p]Have you deserved: it is my father's music
[p]To speak your deeds, not little of his care
[p]To have them recompensed as thought on.
"
"Well, my lord,
[p]If you may please to think I love the king
[p]And through him what is nearest to him, which is
[p]Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
[p]If your more ponderous and settled project
[p]May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
[p]I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
[p]As shall become your highness; where you may
[p]Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
[p]There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
[p]As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
[p]And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
[p]Your discontenting father strive to qualify
[p]And bring him up to liking.
"
"How, Camillo,
[p]May this, almost a miracle, be done?
[p]That I may call thee something more than man
[p]And after that trust to thee.
"
"Have you thought on
[p]A place whereto you'll go?
"
"Not any yet:
[p]But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
[p]To what we wildly do, so we profess
[p]Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
[p]Of every wind that blows.
"
"Then list to me:
[p]This follows, if you will not change your purpose
[p]But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
[p]And there present yourself and your fair princess,
[p]For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
[p]She shall be habited as it becomes
[p]The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
[p]Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
[p]His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
[p]As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
[p]Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
[p]'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
[p]He chides to hell and bids the other grow
[p]Faster than thought or time.
"
"Worthy Camillo,
[p]What colour for my visitation shall I
[p]Hold up before him?
"
"Sent by the king your father
[p]To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
[p]The manner of your bearing towards him, with
[p]What you as from your father shall deliver,
[p]Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
[p]The which shall point you forth at every sitting
[p]What you must say; that he shall not perceive
[p]But that you have your father's bosom there
[p]And speak his very heart.
"
"I am bound to you:
[p]There is some sap in this.
"
"A cause more promising
[p]Than a wild dedication of yourselves
[p]To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
[p]To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
[p]But as you shake off one to take another;
[p]Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
[p]Do their best office, if they can but stay you
[p]Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
[p]Prosperity's the very bond of love,
[p]Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
[p]Affliction alters.
"
"One of these is true:
[p]I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
[p]But not take in the mind.
"
"Yea, say you so?
[p]There shall not at your father's house these
[p]seven years
[p]Be born another such.
"
"My good Camillo,
[p]She is as forward of her breeding as
[p]She is i' the rear our birth.
"
"I cannot say 'tis pity
[p]She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
[p]To most that teach.
"
"Your pardon, sir; for this
[p]I'll blush you thanks.
"
"My prettiest Perdita!
[p]But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
[p]Preserver of my father, now of me,
[p]The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
[p]We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
[p]Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
"
"My lord,
[p]Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
[p]Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
[p]To have you royally appointed as if
[p]The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
[p]That you may know you shall not want, one word.
"
"Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
[p]sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
[p]all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
[p]ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
[p]knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
[p]to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
[p]should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
[p]hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
[p]by which means I saw whose purse was best in
[p]picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
[p]remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
[p]be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
[p]wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
[p]till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
[p]rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
[p]stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
[p]was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
[p]purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
[p]chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
[p]and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
[p]time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
[p]festival purses; and had not the old man come in
[p]with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
[p]son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
[p]left a purse alive in the whole army.
"
"Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
[p]So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
"
"And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
"
"Shall satisfy your father.
"
"Happy be you!
[p]All that you speak shows fair.
"
"Who have we here?
[p][Seeing AUTOLYCUS]
[p]We'll make an instrument of this, omit
[p]Nothing may give us aid.
"
"If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.
"
"How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
[p]not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.
"
"I am a poor fellow, sir.
"
"Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
[p]thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
[p]make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
[p]--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
[p]change garments with this gentleman: though the
[p]pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
[p]there's some boot.
"
"I am a poor fellow, sir.
[p][Aside]
[p]I know ye well enough.
"
"Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
[p]flayed already.
"
"Are you in earnest, sir?
[p][Aside]
[p]I smell the trick on't.
"
"Dispatch, I prithee.
"
"Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
[p]conscience take it.
"
"Unbuckle, unbuckle.
[p][FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments]
[p]Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
[p]Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
[p]Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
[p]And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
[p]Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
[p]The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
[p]For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
[p]Get undescried.
"
"I see the play so lies
[p]That I must bear a part.
"
"No remedy.
[p]Have you done there?
"
"Should I now meet my father,
[p]He would not call me son.
"
"Nay, you shall have no hat.
[p][Giving it to PERDITA]
[p]Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.
"
"Adieu, sir.
"
"O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
[p]Pray you, a word.
"
"[Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the king
[p]Of this escape and whither they are bound;
[p]Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
[p]To force him after: in whose company
[p]I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight
[p]I have a woman's longing.
"
"Fortune speed us!
[p]Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.
"
"The swifter speed the better.
"
"I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
[p]open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
[p]necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
[p]also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
[p]this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
[p]What an exchange had this been without boot! What
[p]a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
[p]this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
[p]extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
[p]iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
[p]clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
[p]honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
[p]do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
[p]and therein am I constant to my profession.
[p][Re-enter Clown and Shepherd]
[p]Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
[p]every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
[p]hanging, yields a careful man work.
"
"See, see; what a man you are now!
[p]There is no other way but to tell the king
[p]she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
"
"Nay, but hear me.
"
"Nay, but hear me.
"
"Go to, then.
"
"She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
[p]and blood has not offended the king; and so your
[p]flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
[p]those things you found about her, those secret
[p]things, all but what she has with her: this being
[p]done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.
"
"I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
[p]son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
[p]neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
[p]me the king's brother-in-law.
"
"Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
[p]could have been to him and then your blood had been
[p]the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
"
"[Aside] Very wisely, puppies!
"
"Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
[p]fardel will make him scratch his beard.
"
"[Aside] I know not what impediment this complaint
[p]may be to the flight of my master.
"
"Pray heartily he be at palace.
"
"[Aside] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so
[p]sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.
[p][Takes off his false beard]
[p]How now, rustics! whither are you bound?
"
"To the palace, an it like your worship.
"
"Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
[p]of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
[p]names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
[p]thing that is fitting to be known, discover.
"
"We are but plain fellows, sir.
"
"A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
[p]lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
[p]often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
[p]it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
[p]they do not give us the lie.
"
"Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
[p]had not taken yourself with the manner.
"
"Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?
"
"Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
[p]thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
[p]hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
[p]receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
[p]not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
[p]for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
[p]business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
[p]cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
[p]back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
[p]open thy affair.
"
"My business, sir, is to the king.
"
"What advocate hast thou to him?
"
"I know not, an't like you.
"
"Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
[p]have none.
"
"None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
"
"How blessed are we that are not simple men!
[p]Yet nature might have made me as these are,
[p]Therefore I will not disdain.
"
"This cannot be but a great courtier.
"
"His garments are rich, but he wears
[p]them not handsomely.
"
"He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
[p]a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking
[p]on's teeth.
"
"The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
[p]Wherefore that box?
"
"Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
[p]which none must know but the king; and which he
[p]shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
[p]speech of him.
"
"Age, thou hast lost thy labour.
"
"Why, sir?
"
"The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
[p]new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
[p]if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
[p]know the king is full of grief.
"
"So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
[p]married a shepherd's daughter.
"
"If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
[p]the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
[p]feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.
"
"Think you so, sir?
"
"Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
[p]and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
[p]him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
[p]under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
[p]yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
[p]ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
[p]grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
[p]is too soft for him, say I. draw our throne into a
[p]sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.
"
"Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
[p]like you, sir?
"
"He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
[p]'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
[p]wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
[p]and a dram dead; then recovered again with
[p]aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
[p]he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
[p]proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
[p]sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
[p]is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
[p]talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
[p]are to be smiled at, their offences being so
[p]capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
[p]men, what you have to the king: being something
[p]gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
[p]aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
[p]whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
[p]besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
[p]shall do it.
"
"He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
[p]give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
[p]bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
[p]the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
[p]and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'
"
"An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
[p]us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much
[p]more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.
"
"After I have done what I promised?
"
"Ay, sir.
"
"Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?
"
"In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
[p]one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.
"
"O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
[p]he'll be made an example.
"
"Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
[p]our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
[p]daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
[p]will give you as much as this old man does when the
[p]business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
[p]pawn till it be brought you.
"
"I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
[p]go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
[p]hedge and follow you.
"
"We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.
"
"Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
"
"If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
[p]not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
[p]courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
[p]to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
[p]that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
[p]these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
[p]think it fit to shore them again and that the
[p]complaint they have to the king concerns him
[p]nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
[p]officious; for I am proof against that title and
[p]what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
[p]them: there may be matter in it.
"
"Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
[p]A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
[p]Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
[p]More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
[p]Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
[p]With them forgive yourself.
"
"Whilst I remember
[p]Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
[p]My blemishes in them, and so still think of
[p]The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
[p]That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
[p]Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
[p]Bred his hopes out of.
"
"True, too true, my lord:
[p]If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
[p]Or from the all that are took something good,
[p]To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
[p]Would be unparallel'd.
"
"I think so. Kill'd!
[p]She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
[p]Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
[p]Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
[p]Say so but seldom.
"
"Not at all, good lady:
[p]You might have spoken a thousand things that would
[p]Have done the time more benefit and graced
[p]Your kindness better.
"
"You are one of those
[p]Would have him wed again.
"
"If you would not so,
[p]You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
[p]Of his most sovereign name; consider little
[p]What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
[p]May drop upon his kingdom and devour
[p]Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
[p]Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
[p]What holier than, for royalty's repair,
[p]For present comfort and for future good,
[p]To bless the bed of majesty again
[p]With a sweet fellow to't?
"
"There is none worthy,
[p]Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
[p]Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
[p]For has not the divine Apollo said,
[p]Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
[p]That King Leontes shall not have an heir
[p]Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
[p]Is all as monstrous to our human reason
[p]As my Antigonus to break his grave
[p]And come again to me; who, on my life,
[p]Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
[p]My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
[p]Oppose against their wills.
[p][To LEONTES]
[p]Care not for issue;
[p]The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
[p]Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
[p]Was like to be the best.
"
"Good Paulina,
[p]Who hast the memory of Hermione,
[p]I know, in honour, O, that ever I
[p]Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
[p]I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
[p]Have taken treasure from her lips--
"
"And left them
[p]More rich for what they yielded.
"
"Thou speak'st truth.
[p]No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
[p]And better used, would make her sainted spirit
[p]Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
[p]Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
[p]And begin, 'Why to me?'
"
"Had she such power,
[p]She had just cause.
"
"She had; and would incense me
[p]To murder her I married.
"
"I should so.
[p]Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
[p]Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
[p]You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
[p]Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
[p]Should be 'Remember mine.'
"
"Stars, stars,
[p]And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
[p]I'll have no wife, Paulina.
"
"Will you swear
[p]Never to marry but by my free leave?
"
"Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!
"
"Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
"
"You tempt him over-much.
"
"Unless another,
[p]As like Hermione as is her picture,
[p]Affront his eye.CLEOMENES. Good madam,--
"
"I have done.
[p]Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
[p]No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
[p]To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
[p]As was your former; but she shall be such
[p]As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
[p]it should take joy
[p]To see her in your arms.
"
"My true Paulina,
[p]We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
"
"That
[p]Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
[p]Never till then.
"
"One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
[p]Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
[p]The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
[p]To your high presence.
"
"What with him? he comes not
[p]Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
[p]So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
[p]'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
[p]By need and accident. What train?
"
"But few,
[p]And those but mean.
"
"His princess, say you, with him?
"
"Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
[p]That e'er the sun shone bright on.
"
"O Hermione,
[p]As every present time doth boast itself
[p]Above a better gone, so must thy grave
[p]Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
[p]Have said and writ so, but your writing now
[p]Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
[p]Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
[p]Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
[p]To say you have seen a better.
"
"Pardon, madam:
[p]The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
[p]The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
[p]Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
[p]Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
[p]Of all professors else, make proselytes
[p]Of who she but bid follow.
"
"How! not women?
"
"Women will love her, that she is a woman
[p]More worth than any man; men, that she is
[p]The rarest of all women.
"
"Go, Cleomenes;
[p]Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
[p]Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
[p][Exeunt CLEOMENES and others]
[p]He thus should steal upon us.
"
"Had our prince,
[p]Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
[p]Well with this lord: there was not full a month
[p]Between their births.
"
"Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
[p]He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
[p]When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
[p]Will bring me to consider that which may
[p]Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
[p][Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA]
[p]Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
[p]For she did print your royal father off,
[p]Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
[p]Your father's image is so hit in you,
[p]His very air, that I should call you brother,
[p]As I did him, and speak of something wildly
[p]By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
[p]And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
[p]I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
[p]Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
[p]You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
[p]All mine own folly--the society,
[p]Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
[p]Though bearing misery, I desire my life
[p]Once more to look on him.
"
"By his command
[p]Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
[p]Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
[p]Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
[p]Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
[p]His wish'd ability, he had himself
[p]The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
[p]Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
[p]He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
[p]And those that bear them living.
"
"O my brother,
[p]Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
[p]Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
[p]So rarely kind, are as interpreters
[p]Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
[p]As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
[p]Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
[p]At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
[p]To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
[p]The adventure of her person?
"
"Good my lord,
[p]She came from Libya.
"
"Where the warlike Smalus,
[p]That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
"
"Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
[p]His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
[p]A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
[p]To execute the charge my father gave me
[p]For visiting your highness: my best train
[p]I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
[p]Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
[p]Not only my success in Libya, sir,
[p]But my arrival and my wife's in safety
[p]Here where we are.
"
"The blessed gods
[p]Purge all infection from our air whilst you
[p]Do climate here! You have a holy father,
[p]A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
[p]So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
[p]For which the heavens, taking angry note,
[p]Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
[p]As he from heaven merits it, with you
[p]Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
[p]Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
[p]Such goodly things as you!
"
"Most noble sir,
[p]That which I shall report will bear no credit,
[p]Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
[p]Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
[p]Desires you to attach his son, who has--
[p]His dignity and duty both cast off--
[p]Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
[p]A shepherd's daughter.
"
"Where's Bohemia? speak.
"
"Here in your city; I now came from him:
[p]I speak amazedly; and it becomes
[p]My marvel and my message. To your court
[p]Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
[p]Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
[p]The father of this seeming lady and
[p]Her brother, having both their country quitted
[p]With this young prince.
"
"Camillo has betray'd me;
[p]Whose honour and whose honesty till now
[p]Endured all weathers.
"
"Lay't so to his charge:
[p]He's with the king your father.
"
"Who? Camillo?
"
"Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
[p]Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
[p]Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
[p]Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
[p]Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
[p]With divers deaths in death.
"
"O my poor father!
[p]The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
[p]Our contract celebrated.
"
"You are married?
"
"We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
[p]The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
[p]The odds for high and low's alike.
"
"My lord,
[p]Is this the daughter of a king?
"
"She is,
[p]When once she is my wife.
"
"That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
[p]Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
[p]Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
[p]Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
[p]Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
[p]That you might well enjoy her.
"
"Dear, look up:
[p]Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
[p]Should chase us with my father, power no jot
[p]Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
[p]Remember since you owed no more to time
[p]Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
[p]Step forth mine advocate; at your request
[p]My father will grant precious things as trifles.
"
"Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
[p]Which he counts but a trifle.
"
"Sir, my liege,
[p]Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
[p]'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
[p]Than what you look on now.
"
"I thought of her,
[p]Even in these looks I made.
[p][To FLORIZEL]
[p]But your petition
[p]Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
[p]Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
[p]I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
[p]I now go toward him; therefore follow me
[p]And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.
"
"Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
"
"I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
[p]shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
[p]whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
[p]commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
[p]heard the shepherd say, he found the child.
"
"I would most gladly know the issue of it.
"
"I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
[p]changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
[p]very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
[p]staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
[p]eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
[p]in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
[p]of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
[p]passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
[p]beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
[p]say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
[p]extremity of the one, it must needs be.
[p][Enter another Gentleman]
[p]Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
[p]The news, Rogero?
"
"Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
[p]king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
[p]broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
[p]cannot be able to express it.
[p][Enter a third Gentleman]
[p]Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
[p]deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
[p]which is called true is so like an old tale, that
[p]the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
[p]found his heir?
"
"Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
[p]circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
[p]see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
[p]of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
[p]the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
[p]know to be his character, the majesty of the
[p]creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
[p]of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
[p]and many other evidences proclaim her with all
[p]certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
[p]the meeting of the two kings?
"
"No.
"
"Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
[p]cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
[p]joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
[p]seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
[p]joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
[p]holding up of hands, with countenances of such
[p]distraction that they were to be known by garment,
[p]not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
[p]himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
[p]joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
[p]thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
[p]embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
[p]daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
[p]shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
[p]conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
[p]another encounter, which lames report to follow it
[p]and undoes description to do it.
"
"What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
[p]hence the child?
"
"Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
[p]rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
[p]open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
[p]avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
[p]innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
[p]handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
"
"What became of his bark and his followers?
"
"Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
[p]in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
[p]instruments which aided to expose the child were
[p]even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
[p]combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
[p]Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
[p]her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
[p]fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
[p]and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
[p]her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
[p]of losing.
"
"The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
[p]kings and princes; for by such was it acted.
"
"One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
[p]angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
[p]the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
[p]death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
[p]confessed and lamented by the king, how
[p]attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
[p]sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
[p]I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
[p]heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
[p]colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
[p]could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.
"
"Are they returned to the court?
"
"No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
[p]which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
[p]years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
[p]Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
[p]eternity and could put breath into his work, would
[p]beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
[p]ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
[p]they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
[p]answer: thither with all greediness of affection
[p]are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
"
"I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
[p]for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
[p]since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
[p]house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
[p]the rejoicing?
"
"Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
[p]every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
[p]our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
[p]Let's along.
"
"Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
[p]would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
[p]man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
[p]them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
[p]at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
[p]so he then took her to be, who began to be much
[p]sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
[p]weather continuing, this mystery remained
[p]undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
[p]been the finder out of this secret, it would not
[p]have relished among my other discredits.
[p][Enter Shepherd and Clown]
[p]Here come those I have done good to against my will,
[p]and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
"
"Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
[p]daughters will be all gentlemen born.
"
"You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
[p]this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
[p]See you these clothes? say you see them not and
[p]think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
[p]these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
[p]lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.
"
"I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
"
"Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.
"
"And so have I, boy.
"
"So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
[p]father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
[p]called me brother; and then the two kings called my
[p]father brother; and then the prince my brother and
[p]the princess my sister called my father father; and
[p]so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
[p]tears that ever we shed.
"
"We may live, son, to shed many more.
"
"Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
[p]preposterous estate as we are.
"
"I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
[p]faults I have committed to your worship and to give
[p]me your good report to the prince my master.
"
"Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
[p]gentlemen.
"
"Thou wilt amend thy life?
"
"Ay, an it like your good worship.
"
"Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
[p]art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
"
"You may say it, but not swear it.
"
"Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
[p]franklins say it, I'll swear it.
"
"How if it be false, son?
"
"If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
[p]it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
[p]the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
[p]that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
[p]tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
[p]drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
[p]be a tall fellow of thy hands.
"
"I will prove so, sir, to my power.
"
"Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
[p]wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
[p]being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
[p]and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
[p]queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
[p]good masters.
"
"O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
[p]That I have had of thee!
"
"What, sovereign sir,
[p]I did not well I meant well. All my services
[p]You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
[p]With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
[p]Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
[p]It is a surplus of your grace, which never
[p]My life may last to answer.
"
"O Paulina,
[p]We honour you with trouble: but we came
[p]To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
[p]Have we pass'd through, not without much content
[p]In many singularities; but we saw not
[p]That which my daughter came to look upon,
[p]The statue of her mother.
"
"As she lived peerless,
[p]So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
[p]Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
[p]Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
[p]Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
[p]To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
[p]Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
[p][PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE]
[p]standing like a statue]
[p]I like your silence, it the more shows off
[p]Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
[p]Comes it not something near?
"
"Her natural posture!
[p]Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
[p]Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
[p]In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
[p]As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
[p]Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
[p]So aged as this seems.
"
"O, not by much.
"
"So much the more our carver's excellence;
[p]Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
[p]As she lived now.
"
"As now she might have done,
[p]So much to my good comfort, as it is
[p]Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
[p]Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
[p]As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
[p]I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
[p]For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
[p]There's magic in thy majesty, which has
[p]My evils conjured to remembrance and
[p]From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
[p]Standing like stone with thee.
"
"And give me leave,
[p]And do not say 'tis superstition, that
[p]I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
[p]Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
[p]Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
"
"O, patience!
[p]The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.
"
"My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
[p]Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
[p]So many summers dry; scarce any joy
[p]Did ever so long live; no sorrow
[p]But kill'd itself much sooner.
"
"Dear my brother,
[p]Let him that was the cause of this have power
[p]To take off so much grief from you as he
[p]Will piece up in himself.
"
"Indeed, my lord,
[p]If I had thought the sight of my poor image
[p]Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
[p]I'ld not have show'd it.
"
"Do not draw the curtain.
"
"No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
[p]May think anon it moves.
"
"Let be, let be.
[p]Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
[p]What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
[p]Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
[p]Did verily bear blood?
"
"Masterly done:
[p]The very life seems warm upon her lip.
"
"The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
[p]As we are mock'd with art.
"
"I'll draw the curtain:
[p]My lord's almost so far transported that
[p]He'll think anon it lives.
"
"O sweet Paulina,
[p]Make me to think so twenty years together!
[p]No settled senses of the world can match
[p]The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
"
"I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
[p]I could afflict you farther.
"
"Do, Paulina;
[p]For this affliction has a taste as sweet
[p]As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
[p]There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
[p]Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
[p]For I will kiss her.
"
"Good my lord, forbear:
[p]The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
[p]You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
[p]With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
"
"No, not these twenty years.
"
"So long could I
[p]Stand by, a looker on.
"
"Either forbear,
[p]Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
[p]For more amazement. If you can behold it,
[p]I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
[p]And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
[p]Which I protest against--I am assisted
[p]By wicked powers.
"
"What you can make her do,
[p]I am content to look on: what to speak,
[p]I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
[p]To make her speak as move.
"
"It is required
[p]You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
[p]On: those that think it is unlawful business
[p]I am about, let them depart.
"
"Proceed:
[p]No foot shall stir.
"
"Music, awake her; strike!
[p][Music]
[p]'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
[p]Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
[p]I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
[p]Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
[p]Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
[p][HERMIONE comes down]
[p]Start not; her actions shall be holy as
[p]You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
[p]Until you see her die again; for then
[p]You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
[p]When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
[p]Is she become the suitor?
"
"O, she's warm!
[p]If this be magic, let it be an art
[p]Lawful as eating.
"
"She embraces him.
"
"She hangs about his neck:
[p]If she pertain to life let her speak too.
"
"Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
[p]Or how stolen from the dead.
"
"That she is living,
[p]Were it but told you, should be hooted at
[p]Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
[p]Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
[p]Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
[p]And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
[p]Our Perdita is found.
"
"You gods, look down
[p]And from your sacred vials pour your graces
[p]Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
[p]Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
[p]Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
[p]Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
[p]Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
[p]Myself to see the issue.
"
"There's time enough for that;
[p]Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
[p]Your joys with like relation. Go together,
[p]You precious winners all; your exultation
[p]Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
[p]Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
[p]My mate, that's never to be found again,
[p]Lament till I am lost.
"
"O, peace, Paulina!
[p]Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
[p]As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
[p]And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
[p]But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
[p]As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
[p]A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
[p]For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
[p]An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
[p]And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
[p]Is richly noted and here justified
[p]By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
[p]What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
[p]That e'er I put between your holy looks
[p]My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
[p]And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
[p]Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
[p]Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
[p]Each one demand an answer to his part
[p]Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
[p]We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
"
