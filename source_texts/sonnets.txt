"From fairest creatures we desire increase,
[p]That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
[p]But as the riper should by time decease,
[p]His tender heir might bear his memory:
[p]But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
[p]Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
[p]Making a famine where abundance lies,
[p]Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
[p]Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
[p]And only herald to the gaudy spring,
[p]Within thine own bud buriest thy content
[p]And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
[p]Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
[p]To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
"
"When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
[p]And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
[p]Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
[p]Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
[p]Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,
[p]Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
[p]To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
[p]Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
[p]How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
[p]If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
[p]Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
[p]Proving his beauty by succession thine!
[p]This were to be new made when thou art old,
[p]And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
"
"Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
[p]Now is the time that face should form another;
[p]Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
[p]Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
[p]For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
[p]Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
[p]Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
[p]Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
[p]Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
[p]Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
[p]So thou through windows of thine age shall see
[p]Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
[p]But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
[p]Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
"
"Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
[p]Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
[p]Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
[p]And being frank she lends to those are free.
[p]Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
[p]The bounteous largess given thee to give?
[p]Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
[p]So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
[p]For having traffic with thyself alone,
[p]Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
[p]Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
[p]What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
[p]Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,
[p]Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
"
"Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
[p]The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
[p]Will play the tyrants to the very same
[p]And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
[p]For never-resting time leads summer on
[p]To hideous winter and confounds him there;
[p]Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
[p]Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:
[p]Then, were not summer's distillation left,
[p]A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
[p]Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
[p]Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
[p]But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,
[p]Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
"
"Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
[p]In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
[p]Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
[p]With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.
[p]That use is not forbidden usury,
[p]Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
[p]That's for thyself to breed another thee,
[p]Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
[p]Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
[p]If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
[p]Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
[p]Leaving thee living in posterity?
[p]Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
[p]To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
"
"Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
[p]Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
[p]Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
[p]Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
[p]And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
[p]Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
[p]yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
[p]Attending on his golden pilgrimage;
[p]But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
[p]Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
[p]The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
[p]From his low tract and look another way:
[p]So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
[p]Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.
"
"Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
[p]Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
[p]Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,
[p]Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
[p]If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
[p]By unions married, do offend thine ear,
[p]They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
[p]In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
[p]Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
[p]Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
[p]Resembling sire and child and happy mother
[p]Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
[p]Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,
[p]Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'
"
"Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
[p]That thou consumest thyself in single life?
[p]Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.
[p]The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;
[p]The world will be thy widow and still weep
[p]That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
[p]When every private widow well may keep
[p]By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.
[p]Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend
[p]Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
[p]But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
[p]And kept unused, the user so destroys it.
[p]No love toward others in that bosom sits
[p]That on himself such murderous shame commits.
"
"For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
[p]Who for thyself art so unprovident.
[p]Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
[p]But that thou none lovest is most evident;
[p]For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
[p]That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.
[p]Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
[p]Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
[p]O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!
[p]Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
[p]Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
[p]Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
[p]Make thee another self, for love of me,
[p]That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
"
"As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest
[p]In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
[p]And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
[p]Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.
[p]Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
[p]Without this, folly, age and cold decay:
[p]If all were minded so, the times should cease
[p]And threescore year would make the world away.
[p]Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
[p]Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:
[p]Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
[p]Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
[p]She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby
[p]Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
"
"When I do count the clock that tells the time,
[p]And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
[p]When I behold the violet past prime,
[p]And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;
[p]When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
[p]Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
[p]And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
[p]Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
[p]Then of thy beauty do I question make,
[p]That thou among the wastes of time must go,
[p]Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
[p]And die as fast as they see others grow;
[p]And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
[p]Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
"
"O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are
[p]No longer yours than you yourself here live:
[p]Against this coming end you should prepare,
[p]And your sweet semblance to some other give.
[p]So should that beauty which you hold in lease
[p]Find no determination: then you were
[p]Yourself again after yourself's decease,
[p]When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
[p]Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
[p]Which husbandry in honour might uphold
[p]Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
[p]And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
[p]O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know
[p]You had a father: let your son say so.
"
"Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
[p]And yet methinks I have astronomy,
[p]But not to tell of good or evil luck,
[p]Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
[p]Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
[p]Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
[p]Or say with princes if it shall go well,
[p]By oft predict that I in heaven find:
[p]But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
[p]And, constant stars, in them I read such art
[p]As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
[p]If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
[p]Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
[p]Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
"
"When I consider every thing that grows
[p]Holds in perfection but a little moment,
[p]That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
[p]Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
[p]When I perceive that men as plants increase,
[p]Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,
[p]Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
[p]And wear their brave state out of memory;
[p]Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
[p]Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
[p]Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,
[p]To change your day of youth to sullied night;
[p]And all in war with Time for love of you,
[p]As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
"
"But wherefore do not you a mightier way
[p]Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
[p]And fortify yourself in your decay
[p]With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
[p]Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
[p]And many maiden gardens yet unset
[p]With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
[p]Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
[p]So should the lines of life that life repair,
[p]Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
[p]Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
[p]Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
[p]To give away yourself keeps yourself still,
[p]And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.
"
"Who will believe my verse in time to come,
[p]If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
[p]Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
[p]Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
[p]If I could write the beauty of your eyes
[p]And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
[p]The age to come would say 'This poet lies:
[p]Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
[p]So should my papers yellow'd with their age
[p]Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,
[p]And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
[p]And stretched metre of an antique song:
[p]But were some child of yours alive that time,
[p]You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
"
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
[p]Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
[p]Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
[p]And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
[p]Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
[p]And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
[p]And every fair from fair sometime declines,
[p]By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
[p]But thy eternal summer shall not fade
[p]Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
[p]Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
[p]When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
[p]So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
[p]So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
"
"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
[p]And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
[p]Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
[p]And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
[p]Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
[p]And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
[p]To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
[p]But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
[p]O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
[p]Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
[p]Him in thy course untainted do allow
[p]For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
[p]Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
[p]My love shall in my verse ever live young.
"
"A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted
[p]Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
[p]A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
[p]With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
[p]An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
[p]Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
[p]A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,
[p]Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
[p]And for a woman wert thou first created;
[p]Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
[p]And by addition me of thee defeated,
[p]By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
[p]But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
[p]Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
"
"So is it not with me as with that Muse
[p]Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
[p]Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
[p]And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
[p]Making a couplement of proud compare,
[p]With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
[p]With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare
[p]That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
[p]O' let me, true in love, but truly write,
[p]And then believe me, my love is as fair
[p]As any mother's child, though not so bright
[p]As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
[p]Let them say more than like of hearsay well;
[p]I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
"
"My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
[p]So long as youth and thou are of one date;
[p]But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
[p]Then look I death my days should expiate.
[p]For all that beauty that doth cover thee
[p]Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
[p]Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
[p]How can I then be elder than thou art?
[p]O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
[p]As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
[p]Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
[p]As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
[p]Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
[p]Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.
"
"As an unperfect actor on the stage
[p]Who with his fear is put besides his part,
[p]Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
[p]Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.
[p]So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
[p]The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
[p]And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
[p]O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.
[p]O, let my books be then the eloquence
[p]And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
[p]Who plead for love and look for recompense
[p]More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
[p]O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:
[p]To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
"
"Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
[p]Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
[p]My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
[p]And perspective it is the painter's art.
[p]For through the painter must you see his skill,
[p]To find where your true image pictured lies;
[p]Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
[p]That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
[p]Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
[p]Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
[p]Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
[p]Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
[p]Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;
[p]They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
"
"Let those who are in favour with their stars
[p]Of public honour and proud titles boast,
[p]Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
[p]Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
[p]Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
[p]But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
[p]And in themselves their pride lies buried,
[p]For at a frown they in their glory die.
[p]The painful warrior famoused for fight,
[p]After a thousand victories once foil'd,
[p]Is from the book of honour razed quite,
[p]And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
[p]Then happy I, that love and am beloved
[p]Where I may not remove nor be removed.
"
"Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
[p]Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
[p]To thee I send this written embassage,
[p]To witness duty, not to show my wit:
[p]Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
[p]May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
[p]But that I hope some good conceit of thine
[p]In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;
[p]Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
[p]Points on me graciously with fair aspect
[p]And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
[p]To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
[p]Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
[p]Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
"
"Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
[p]The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
[p]But then begins a journey in my head,
[p]To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
[p]For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
[p]Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
[p]And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
[p]Looking on darkness which the blind do see
[p]Save that my soul's imaginary sight
[p]Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
[p]Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,
[p]Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.
[p]Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
[p]For thee and for myself no quiet find.
"
"How can I then return in happy plight,
[p]That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?
[p]When day's oppression is not eased by night,
[p]But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?
[p]And each, though enemies to either's reign,
[p]Do in consent shake hands to torture me;
[p]The one by toil, the other to complain
[p]How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
[p]I tell the day, to please them thou art bright
[p]And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
[p]So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
[p]When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
[p]But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
[p]And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem stronger.
"
"When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
[p]I all alone beweep my outcast state
[p]And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
[p]And look upon myself and curse my fate,
[p]Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
[p]Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,
[p]Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
[p]With what I most enjoy contented least;
[p]Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
[p]Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
[p]Like to the lark at break of day arising
[p]From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
[p]For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
[p]That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
"
"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
[p]I summon up remembrance of things past,
[p]I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
[p]And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
[p]Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
[p]For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
[p]And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
[p]And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
[p]Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
[p]And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
[p]The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
[p]Which I new pay as if not paid before.
[p]But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
[p]All losses are restored and sorrows end.
"
"Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
[p]Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
[p]And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
[p]And all those friends which I thought buried.
[p]How many a holy and obsequious tear
[p]Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
[p]As interest of the dead, which now appear
[p]But things removed that hidden in thee lie!
[p]Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
[p]Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
[p]Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
[p]That due of many now is thine alone:
[p]Their images I loved I view in thee,
[p]And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.
"
"If thou survive my well-contented day,
[p]When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,
[p]And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
[p]These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
[p]Compare them with the bettering of the time,
[p]And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
[p]Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
[p]Exceeded by the height of happier men.
[p]O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
[p]'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
[p]A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
[p]To march in ranks of better equipage:
[p]But since he died and poets better prove,
[p]Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'
"
"Full many a glorious morning have I seen
[p]Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
[p]Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
[p]Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
[p]Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
[p]With ugly rack on his celestial face,
[p]And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
[p]Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
[p]Even so my sun one early morn did shine
[p]With all triumphant splendor on my brow;
[p]But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
[p]The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
[p]Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
[p]Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.
"
"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
[p]And make me travel forth without my cloak,
[p]To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
[p]Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
[p]'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
[p]To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
[p]For no man well of such a salve can speak
[p]That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
[p]Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
[p]Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
[p]The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
[p]To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
[p]Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
[p]And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.
"
"No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
[p]Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
[p]Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
[p]And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
[p]All men make faults, and even I in this,
[p]Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
[p]Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
[p]Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
[p]For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--
[p]Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
[p]And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
[p]Such civil war is in my love and hate
[p]That I an accessary needs must be
[p]To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
"
"Let me confess that we two must be twain,
[p]Although our undivided loves are one:
[p]So shall those blots that do with me remain
[p]Without thy help by me be borne alone.
[p]In our two loves there is but one respect,
[p]Though in our lives a separable spite,
[p]Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
[p]Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
[p]I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
[p]Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
[p]Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
[p]Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
[p]But do not so; I love thee in such sort
[p]As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
"
"As a decrepit father takes delight
[p]To see his active child do deeds of youth,
[p]So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,
[p]Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
[p]For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
[p]Or any of these all, or all, or more,
[p]Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,
[p]I make my love engrafted to this store:
[p]So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
[p]Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
[p]That I in thy abundance am sufficed
[p]And by a part of all thy glory live.
[p]Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:
[p]This wish I have; then ten times happy me!
"
"How can my Muse want subject to invent,
[p]While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
[p]Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
[p]For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
[p]O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me
[p]Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
[p]For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
[p]When thou thyself dost give invention light?
[p]Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
[p]Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
[p]And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
[p]Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
[p]If my slight Muse do please these curious days,
[p]The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
"
"O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,
[p]When thou art all the better part of me?
[p]What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
[p]And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?
[p]Even for this let us divided live,
[p]And our dear love lose name of single one,
[p]That by this separation I may give
[p]That due to thee which thou deservest alone.
[p]O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,
[p]Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
[p]To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
[p]Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
[p]And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
[p]By praising him here who doth hence remain!
"
"Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;
[p]What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
[p]No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
[p]All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
[p]Then if for my love thou my love receivest,
[p]I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
[p]But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest
[p]By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
[p]I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
[p]Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
[p]And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief
[p]To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.
[p]Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
[p]Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
"
"Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,
[p]When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
[p]Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,
[p]For still temptation follows where thou art.
[p]Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
[p]Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;
[p]And when a woman woos, what woman's son
[p]Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?
[p]Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,
[p]And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,
[p]Who lead thee in their riot even there
[p]Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,
[p]Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
[p]Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.
"
"That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,
[p]And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
[p]That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,
[p]A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
[p]Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:
[p]Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;
[p]And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
[p]Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
[p]If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
[p]And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
[p]Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
[p]And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
[p]But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
[p]Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.
"
"When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
[p]For all the day they view things unrespected;
[p]But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
[p]And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.
[p]Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
[p]How would thy shadow's form form happy show
[p]To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
[p]When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
[p]How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
[p]By looking on thee in the living day,
[p]When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
[p]Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
[p]All days are nights to see till I see thee,
[p]And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
"
"If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
[p]Injurious distance should not stop my way;
[p]For then despite of space I would be brought,
[p]From limits far remote where thou dost stay.
[p]No matter then although my foot did stand
[p]Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
[p]For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
[p]As soon as think the place where he would be.
[p]But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
[p]To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
[p]But that so much of earth and water wrought
[p]I must attend time's leisure with my moan,
[p]Receiving nought by elements so slow
[p]But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
"
"The other two, slight air and purging fire,
[p]Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
[p]The first my thought, the other my desire,
[p]These present-absent with swift motion slide.
[p]For when these quicker elements are gone
[p]In tender embassy of love to thee,
[p]My life, being made of four, with two alone
[p]Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
[p]Until life's composition be recured
[p]By those swift messengers return'd from thee,
[p]Who even but now come back again, assured
[p]Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
[p]This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
[p]I send them back again and straight grow sad.
"
"Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
[p]How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
[p]Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
[p]My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
[p]My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--
[p]A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--
[p]But the defendant doth that plea deny
[p]And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
[p]To 'cide this title is impanneled
[p]A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
[p]And by their verdict is determined
[p]The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:
[p]As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
[p]And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.
"
"Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
[p]And each doth good turns now unto the other:
[p]When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
[p]Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
[p]With my love's picture then my eye doth feast
[p]And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
[p]Another time mine eye is my heart's guest
[p]And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
[p]So, either by thy picture or my love,
[p]Thyself away art resent still with me;
[p]For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
[p]And I am still with them and they with thee;
[p]Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
[p]Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.
"
"How careful was I, when I took my way,
[p]Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
[p]That to my use it might unused stay
[p]From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
[p]But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
[p]Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,
[p]Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,
[p]Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
[p]Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
[p]Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
[p]Within the gentle closure of my breast,
[p]From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
[p]And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,
[p]For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
"
"Against that time, if ever that time come,
[p]When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
[p]When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
[p]Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
[p]Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
[p]And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
[p]When love, converted from the thing it was,
[p]Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--
[p]Against that time do I ensconce me here
[p]Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
[p]And this my hand against myself uprear,
[p]To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
[p]To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
[p]Since why to love I can allege no cause.
"
"How heavy do I journey on the way,
[p]When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
[p]Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
[p]'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
[p]The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
[p]Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
[p]As if by some instinct the wretch did know
[p]His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:
[p]The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
[p]That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;
[p]Which heavily he answers with a groan,
[p]More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
[p]For that same groan doth put this in my mind;
[p]My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
"
"Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
[p]Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
[p]From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
[p]Till I return, of posting is no need.
[p]O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,
[p]When swift extremity can seem but slow?
[p]Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;
[p]In winged speed no motion shall I know:
[p]Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
[p]Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,
[p]Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
[p]But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;
[p]Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,
[p]Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.
"
"So am I as the rich, whose blessed key
[p]Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
[p]The which he will not every hour survey,
[p]For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
[p]Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
[p]Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,
[p]Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
[p]Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
[p]So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
[p]Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
[p]To make some special instant special blest,
[p]By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
[p]Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,
[p]Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.
"
"What is your substance, whereof are you made,
[p]That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
[p]Since every one hath, every one, one shade,
[p]And you, but one, can every shadow lend.
[p]Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
[p]Is poorly imitated after you;
[p]On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
[p]And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
[p]Speak of the spring and foison of the year;
[p]The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
[p]The other as your bounty doth appear;
[p]And you in every blessed shape we know.
[p]In all external grace you have some part,
[p]But you like none, none you, for constant heart.
"
"O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
[p]By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
[p]The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
[p]For that sweet odour which doth in it live.
[p]The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye
[p]As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
[p]Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
[p]When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
[p]But, for their virtue only is their show,
[p]They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,
[p]Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
[p]Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
[p]And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
[p]When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.
"
"Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
[p]Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
[p]But you shall shine more bright in these contents
[p]Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.
[p]When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
[p]And broils root out the work of masonry,
[p]Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
[p]The living record of your memory.
[p]'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
[p]Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
[p]Even in the eyes of all posterity
[p]That wear this world out to the ending doom.
[p]So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
[p]You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.
"
"Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
[p]Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
[p]Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
[p]To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:
[p]So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill
[p]Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,
[p]To-morrow see again, and do not kill
[p]The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.
[p]Let this sad interim like the ocean be
[p]Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
[p]Come daily to the banks, that, when they see
[p]Return of love, more blest may be the view;
[p]Else call it winter, which being full of care
[p]Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.
"
"Being your slave, what should I do but tend
[p]Upon the hours and times of your desire?
[p]I have no precious time at all to spend,
[p]Nor services to do, till you require.
[p]Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
[p]Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
[p]Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
[p]When you have bid your servant once adieu;
[p]Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
[p]Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
[p]But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
[p]Save, where you are how happy you make those.
[p]So true a fool is love that in your will,
[p]Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.
"
"That god forbid that made me first your slave,
[p]I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
[p]Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
[p]Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
[p]O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
[p]The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
[p]And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,
[p]Without accusing you of injury.
[p]Be where you list, your charter is so strong
[p]That you yourself may privilege your time
[p]To what you will; to you it doth belong
[p]Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
[p]I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;
[p]Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.
"
"If there be nothing new, but that which is
[p]Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
[p]Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss
[p]The second burden of a former child!
[p]O, that record could with a backward look,
[p]Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
[p]Show me your image in some antique book,
[p]Since mind at first in character was done!
[p]That I might see what the old world could say
[p]To this composed wonder of your frame;
[p]Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
[p]Or whether revolution be the same.
[p]O, sure I am, the wits of former days
[p]To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
"
"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
[p]So do our minutes hasten to their end;
[p]Each changing place with that which goes before,
[p]In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
[p]Nativity, once in the main of light,
[p]Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
[p]Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,
[p]And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
[p]Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
[p]And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
[p]Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
[p]And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
[p]And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,
[p]Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
"
"Is it thy will thy image should keep open
[p]My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
[p]Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
[p]While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
[p]Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
[p]So far from home into my deeds to pry,
[p]To find out shames and idle hours in me,
[p]The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?
[p]O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
[p]It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;
[p]Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
[p]To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
[p]For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
[p]From me far off, with others all too near.
"
"Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
[p]And all my soul and all my every part;
[p]And for this sin there is no remedy,
[p]It is so grounded inward in my heart.
[p]Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
[p]No shape so true, no truth of such account;
[p]And for myself mine own worth do define,
[p]As I all other in all worths surmount.
[p]But when my glass shows me myself indeed,
[p]Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,
[p]Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
[p]Self so self-loving were iniquity.
[p]'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,
[p]Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
"
"Against my love shall be, as I am now,
[p]With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;
[p]When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
[p]With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
[p]Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,
[p]And all those beauties whereof now he's king
[p]Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,
[p]Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
[p]For such a time do I now fortify
[p]Against confounding age's cruel knife,
[p]That he shall never cut from memory
[p]My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
[p]His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
[p]And they shall live, and he in them still green.
"
"When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
[p]The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
[p]When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
[p]And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
[p]When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
[p]Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
[p]And the firm soil win of the watery main,
[p]Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
[p]When I have seen such interchange of state,
[p]Or state itself confounded to decay;
[p]Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
[p]That Time will come and take my love away.
[p]This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
[p]But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
"
"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
[p]But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,
[p]How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
[p]Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
[p]O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
[p]Against the wreckful siege of battering days,
[p]When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
[p]Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
[p]O fearful meditation! where, alack,
[p]Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
[p]Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
[p]Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
[p]O, none, unless this miracle have might,
[p]That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
"
"Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
[p]As, to behold desert a beggar born,
[p]And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
[p]And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
[p]And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,
[p]And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
[p]And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
[p]And strength by limping sway disabled,
[p]And art made tongue-tied by authority,
[p]And folly doctor-like controlling skill,
[p]And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
[p]And captive good attending captain ill:
[p]Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
[p]Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
"
"Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
[p]And with his presence grace impiety,
[p]That sin by him advantage should achieve
[p]And lace itself with his society?
[p]Why should false painting imitate his cheek
[p]And steal dead seeing of his living hue?
[p]Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
[p]Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
[p]Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
[p]Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
[p]For she hath no exchequer now but his,
[p]And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.
[p]O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had
[p]In days long since, before these last so bad.
"
"Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
[p]When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
[p]Before the bastard signs of fair were born,
[p]Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
[p]Before the golden tresses of the dead,
[p]The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
[p]To live a second life on second head;
[p]Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
[p]In him those holy antique hours are seen,
[p]Without all ornament, itself and true,
[p]Making no summer of another's green,
[p]Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
[p]And him as for a map doth Nature store,
[p]To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
"
"Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
[p]Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
[p]All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,
[p]Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
[p]Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
[p]But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
[p]In other accents do this praise confound
[p]By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
[p]They look into the beauty of thy mind,
[p]And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;
[p]Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
[p]To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
[p]But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
[p]The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.
"
"That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
[p]For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
[p]The ornament of beauty is suspect,
[p]A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
[p]So thou be good, slander doth but approve
[p]Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;
[p]For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
[p]And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
[p]Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,
[p]Either not assail'd or victor being charged;
[p]Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
[p]To tie up envy evermore enlarged:
[p]If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
[p]Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
"
"No longer mourn for me when I am dead
[p]Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
[p]Give warning to the world that I am fled
[p]From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:
[p]Nay, if you read this line, remember not
[p]The hand that writ it; for I love you so
[p]That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
[p]If thinking on me then should make you woe.
[p]O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
[p]When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
[p]Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
[p]But let your love even with my life decay,
[p]Lest the wise world should look into your moan
[p]And mock you with me after I am gone.
"
"O, lest the world should task you to recite
[p]What merit lived in me, that you should love
[p]After my death, dear love, forget me quite,
[p]For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
[p]Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
[p]To do more for me than mine own desert,
[p]And hang more praise upon deceased I
[p]Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
[p]O, lest your true love may seem false in this,
[p]That you for love speak well of me untrue,
[p]My name be buried where my body is,
[p]And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
[p]For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
[p]And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
"
"That time of year thou mayst in me behold
[p]When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
[p]Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
[p]Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
[p]In me thou seest the twilight of such day
[p]As after sunset fadeth in the west,
[p]Which by and by black night doth take away,
[p]Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
[p]In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
[p]That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
[p]As the death-bed whereon it must expire
[p]Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.
[p]This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,
[p]To love that well which thou must leave ere long.
"
"But be contented: when that fell arrest
[p]Without all bail shall carry me away,
[p]My life hath in this line some interest,
[p]Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
[p]When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
[p]The very part was consecrate to thee:
[p]The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
[p]My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
[p]So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
[p]The prey of worms, my body being dead,
[p]The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
[p]Too base of thee to be remembered.
[p]The worth of that is that which it contains,
[p]And that is this, and this with thee remains.
"
"So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
[p]Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
[p]And for the peace of you I hold such strife
[p]As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;
[p]Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
[p]Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
[p]Now counting best to be with you alone,
[p]Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;
[p]Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
[p]And by and by clean starved for a look;
[p]Possessing or pursuing no delight,
[p]Save what is had or must from you be took.
[p]Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
[p]Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
"
"Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
[p]So far from variation or quick change?
[p]Why with the time do I not glance aside
[p]To new-found methods and to compounds strange?
[p]Why write I still all one, ever the same,
[p]And keep invention in a noted weed,
[p]That every word doth almost tell my name,
[p]Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
[p]O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,
[p]And you and love are still my argument;
[p]So all my best is dressing old words new,
[p]Spending again what is already spent:
[p]For as the sun is daily new and old,
[p]So is my love still telling what is told.
"
"Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
[p]Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
[p]The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
[p]And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.
[p]The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
[p]Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
[p]Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
[p]Time's thievish progress to eternity.
[p]Look, what thy memory can not contain
[p]Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
[p]Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
[p]To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
[p]These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
[p]Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.
"
"So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
[p]And found such fair assistance in my verse
[p]As every alien pen hath got my use
[p]And under thee their poesy disperse.
[p]Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
[p]And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
[p]Have added feathers to the learned's wing
[p]And given grace a double majesty.
[p]Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
[p]Whose influence is thine and born of thee:
[p]In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
[p]And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
[p]But thou art all my art and dost advance
[p]As high as learning my rude ignorance.
"
"Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
[p]My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
[p]But now my gracious numbers are decay'd
[p]And my sick Muse doth give another place.
[p]I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
[p]Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
[p]Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
[p]He robs thee of and pays it thee again.
[p]He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
[p]From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
[p]And found it in thy cheek; he can afford
[p]No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
[p]Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
[p]Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.
"
"O, how I faint when I of you do write,
[p]Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
[p]And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
[p]To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!
[p]But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,
[p]The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
[p]My saucy bark inferior far to his
[p]On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
[p]Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
[p]Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
[p]Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,
[p]He of tall building and of goodly pride:
[p]Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
[p]The worst was this; my love was my decay.
"
"Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
[p]Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
[p]From hence your memory death cannot take,
[p]Although in me each part will be forgotten.
[p]Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
[p]Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
[p]The earth can yield me but a common grave,
[p]When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
[p]Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
[p]Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
[p]And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
[p]When all the breathers of this world are dead;
[p]You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--
[p]Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
"
"I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
[p]And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
[p]The dedicated words which writers use
[p]Of their fair subject, blessing every book
[p]Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
[p]Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
[p]And therefore art enforced to seek anew
[p]Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days
[p]And do so, love; yet when they have devised
[p]What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
[p]Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
[p]In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;
[p]And their gross painting might be better used
[p]Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.
"
"I never saw that you did painting need
[p]And therefore to your fair no painting set;
[p]I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
[p]The barren tender of a poet's debt;
[p]And therefore have I slept in your report,
[p]That you yourself being extant well might show
[p]How far a modern quill doth come too short,
[p]Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
[p]This silence for my sin you did impute,
[p]Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;
[p]For I impair not beauty being mute,
[p]When others would give life and bring a tomb.
[p]There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
[p]Than both your poets can in praise devise.
"
"Who is it that says most? which can say more
[p]Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?
[p]In whose confine immured is the store
[p]Which should example where your equal grew.
[p]Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
[p]That to his subject lends not some small glory;
[p]But he that writes of you, if he can tell
[p]That you are you, so dignifies his story,
[p]Let him but copy what in you is writ,
[p]Not making worse what nature made so clear,
[p]And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
[p]Making his style admired every where.
[p]You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
[p]Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
"
"My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
[p]While comments of your praise, richly compiled,
[p]Reserve their character with golden quill
[p]And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
[p]I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,
[p]And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'
[p]To every hymn that able spirit affords
[p]In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
[p]Hearing you praised, I say 'Tis so, 'tis true,'
[p]And to the most of praise add something more;
[p]But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
[p]Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
[p]Then others for the breath of words respect,
[p]Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
"
"Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
[p]Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
[p]That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
[p]Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
[p]Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
[p]Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
[p]No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
[p]Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
[p]He, nor that affable familiar ghost
[p]Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
[p]As victors of my silence cannot boast;
[p]I was not sick of any fear from thence:
[p]But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
[p]Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.
"
"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
[p]And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:
[p]The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
[p]My bonds in thee are all determinate.
[p]For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
[p]And for that riches where is my deserving?
[p]The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
[p]And so my patent back again is swerving.
[p]Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,
[p]Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;
[p]So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
[p]Comes home again, on better judgment making.
[p]Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
[p]In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
"
"When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
[p]And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
[p]Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,
[p]And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
[p]With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
[p]Upon thy part I can set down a story
[p]Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,
[p]That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
[p]And I by this will be a gainer too;
[p]For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
[p]The injuries that to myself I do,
[p]Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
[p]Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
[p]That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.
"
"Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
[p]And I will comment upon that offence;
[p]Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
[p]Against thy reasons making no defence.
[p]Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,
[p]To set a form upon desired change,
[p]As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,
[p]I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
[p]Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue
[p]Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
[p]Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong
[p]And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
[p]For thee against myself I'll vow debate,
[p]For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
"
"Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
[p]Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
[p]Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
[p]And do not drop in for an after-loss:
[p]Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,
[p]Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
[p]Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
[p]To linger out a purposed overthrow.
[p]If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
[p]When other petty griefs have done their spite
[p]But in the onset come; so shall I taste
[p]At first the very worst of fortune's might,
[p]And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
[p]Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.
"
"Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
[p]Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,
[p]Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,
[p]Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
[p]And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
[p]Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
[p]But these particulars are not my measure;
[p]All these I better in one general best.
[p]Thy love is better than high birth to me,
[p]Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
[p]Of more delight than hawks or horses be;
[p]And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
[p]Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
[p]All this away and me most wretched make.
"
"But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
[p]For term of life thou art assured mine,
[p]And life no longer than thy love will stay,
[p]For it depends upon that love of thine.
[p]Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
[p]When in the least of them my life hath end.
[p]I see a better state to me belongs
[p]Than that which on thy humour doth depend;
[p]Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
[p]Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
[p]O, what a happy title do I find,
[p]Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
[p]But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
[p]Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
"
"So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
[p]Like a deceived husband; so love's face
[p]May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
[p]Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
[p]For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
[p]Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
[p]In many's looks the false heart's history
[p]Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,
[p]But heaven in thy creation did decree
[p]That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
[p]Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,
[p]Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.
[p]How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
[p]if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!
"
"They that have power to hurt and will do none,
[p]That do not do the thing they most do show,
[p]Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
[p]Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,
[p]They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
[p]And husband nature's riches from expense;
[p]They are the lords and owners of their faces,
[p]Others but stewards of their excellence.
[p]The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
[p]Though to itself it only live and die,
[p]But if that flower with base infection meet,
[p]The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
[p]For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
[p]Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
"
"How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
[p]Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
[p]Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
[p]O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
[p]That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
[p]Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
[p]Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
[p]Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
[p]O, what a mansion have those vices got
[p]Which for their habitation chose out thee,
[p]Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
[p]And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!
[p]Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
[p]The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
"
"Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
[p]Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
[p]Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;
[p]Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.
[p]As on the finger of a throned queen
[p]The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
[p]So are those errors that in thee are seen
[p]To truths translated and for true things deem'd.
[p]How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,
[p]If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
[p]How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
[p]If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
[p]But do not so; I love thee in such sort
[p]As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
"
"How like a winter hath my absence been
[p]From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
[p]What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
[p]What old December's bareness every where!
[p]And yet this time removed was summer's time,
[p]The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
[p]Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
[p]Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
[p]Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
[p]But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;
[p]For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
[p]And, thou away, the very birds are mute;
[p]Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer
[p]That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
"
"From you have I been absent in the spring,
[p]When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
[p]Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
[p]That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
[p]Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
[p]Of different flowers in odour and in hue
[p]Could make me any summer's story tell,
[p]Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;
[p]Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
[p]Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
[p]They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
[p]Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
[p]Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,
[p]As with your shadow I with these did play:
"
"The forward violet thus did I chide:
[p]Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
[p]If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
[p]Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
[p]In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
[p]The lily I condemned for thy hand,
[p]And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:
[p]The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
[p]One blushing shame, another white despair;
[p]A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both
[p]And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
[p]But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
[p]A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
[p]More flowers I noted, yet I none could see
[p]But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.
"
"Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long
[p]To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
[p]Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
[p]Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
[p]Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
[p]In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
[p]Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
[p]And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
[p]Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
[p]If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
[p]If any, be a satire to decay,
[p]And make Time's spoils despised every where.
[p]Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;
[p]So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.
"
"O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
[p]For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
[p]Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
[p]So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
[p]Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say
[p]'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
[p]Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
[p]But best is best, if never intermix'd?'
[p]Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
[p]Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
[p]To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,
[p]And to be praised of ages yet to be.
[p]Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
[p]To make him seem long hence as he shows now.
"
"My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
[p]I love not less, though less the show appear:
[p]That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
[p]The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
[p]Our love was new and then but in the spring
[p]When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
[p]As Philomel in summer's front doth sing
[p]And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
[p]Not that the summer is less pleasant now
[p]Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
[p]But that wild music burthens every bough
[p]And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
[p]Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,
[p]Because I would not dull you with my song.
"
"Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,
[p]That having such a scope to show her pride,
[p]The argument all bare is of more worth
[p]Than when it hath my added praise beside!
[p]O, blame me not, if I no more can write!
[p]Look in your glass, and there appears a face
[p]That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
[p]Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
[p]Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
[p]To mar the subject that before was well?
[p]For to no other pass my verses tend
[p]Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
[p]And more, much more, than in my verse can sit
[p]Your own glass shows you when you look in it.
"
"To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
[p]For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
[p]Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
[p]Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
[p]Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
[p]In process of the seasons have I seen,
[p]Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
[p]Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
[p]Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
[p]Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
[p]So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
[p]Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
[p]For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;
[p]Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
"
"Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
[p]Nor my beloved as an idol show,
[p]Since all alike my songs and praises be
[p]To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
[p]Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
[p]Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
[p]Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
[p]One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
[p]'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,
[p]'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;
[p]And in this change is my invention spent,
[p]Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
[p]'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,
[p]Which three till now never kept seat in one.
"
"When in the chronicle of wasted time
[p]I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
[p]And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
[p]In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
[p]Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
[p]Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
[p]I see their antique pen would have express'd
[p]Even such a beauty as you master now.
[p]So all their praises are but prophecies
[p]Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
[p]And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,
[p]They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
[p]For we, which now behold these present days,
[p]Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
"
"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
[p]Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
[p]Can yet the lease of my true love control,
[p]Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
[p]The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
[p]And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
[p]Incertainties now crown themselves assured
[p]And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
[p]Now with the drops of this most balmy time
[p]My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
[p]Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
[p]While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
[p]And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
[p]When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
"
"What's in the brain that ink may character
[p]Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?
[p]What's new to speak, what new to register,
[p]That may express my love or thy dear merit?
[p]Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
[p]I must, each day say o'er the very same,
[p]Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
[p]Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
[p]So that eternal love in love's fresh case
[p]Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
[p]Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
[p]But makes antiquity for aye his page,
[p]Finding the first conceit of love there bred
[p]Where time and outward form would show it dead.
"
"O, never say that I was false of heart,
[p]Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.
[p]As easy might I from myself depart
[p]As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:
[p]That is my home of love: if I have ranged,
[p]Like him that travels I return again,
[p]Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
[p]So that myself bring water for my stain.
[p]Never believe, though in my nature reign'd
[p]All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
[p]That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
[p]To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
[p]For nothing this wide universe I call,
[p]Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.
"
"Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there
[p]And made myself a motley to the view,
[p]Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
[p]Made old offences of affections new;
[p]Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
[p]Askance and strangely: but, by all above,
[p]These blenches gave my heart another youth,
[p]And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
[p]Now all is done, have what shall have no end:
[p]Mine appetite I never more will grind
[p]On newer proof, to try an older friend,
[p]A god in love, to whom I am confined.
[p]Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
[p]Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
"
"O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
[p]The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
[p]That did not better for my life provide
[p]Than public means which public manners breeds.
[p]Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
[p]And almost thence my nature is subdued
[p]To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
[p]Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;
[p]Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
[p]Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
[p]No bitterness that I will bitter think,
[p]Nor double penance, to correct correction.
[p]Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye
[p]Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
"
"Your love and pity doth the impression fill
[p]Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
[p]For what care I who calls me well or ill,
[p]So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
[p]You are my all the world, and I must strive
[p]To know my shames and praises from your tongue:
[p]None else to me, nor I to none alive,
[p]That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
[p]In so profound abysm I throw all care
[p]Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
[p]To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
[p]Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
[p]You are so strongly in my purpose bred
[p]That all the world besides methinks are dead.
"
"Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
[p]And that which governs me to go about
[p]Doth part his function and is partly blind,
[p]Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
[p]For it no form delivers to the heart
[p]Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:
[p]Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
[p]Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
[p]For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,
[p]The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
[p]The mountain or the sea, the day or night,
[p]The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:
[p]Incapable of more, replete with you,
[p]My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.
"
"Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
[p]Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
[p]Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
[p]And that your love taught it this alchemy,
[p]To make of monsters and things indigest
[p]Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
[p]Creating every bad a perfect best,
[p]As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
[p]O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,
[p]And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
[p]Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
[p]And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
[p]If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
[p]That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
"
"Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
[p]Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
[p]Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
[p]My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
[p]But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents
[p]Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,
[p]Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
[p]Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
[p]Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,
[p]Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
[p]When I was certain o'er incertainty,
[p]Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
[p]Love is a babe; then might I not say so,
[p]To give full growth to that which still doth grow?
"
"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
[p]Admit impediments. Love is not love
[p]Which alters when it alteration finds,
[p]Or bends with the remover to remove:
[p]O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
[p]That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
[p]It is the star to every wandering bark,
[p]Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
[p]Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
[p]Within his bending sickle's compass come:
[p]Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
[p]But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
[p]If this be error and upon me proved,
[p]I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
"
"Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
[p]Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
[p]Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
[p]Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
[p]That I have frequent been with unknown minds
[p]And given to time your own dear-purchased right
[p]That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
[p]Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
[p]Book both my wilfulness and errors down
[p]And on just proof surmise accumulate;
[p]Bring me within the level of your frown,
[p]But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
[p]Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
[p]The constancy and virtue of your love.
"
"Like as, to make our appetites more keen,
[p]With eager compounds we our palate urge,
[p]As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
[p]We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,
[p]Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
[p]To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
[p]And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
[p]To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
[p]Thus policy in love, to anticipate
[p]The ills that were not, grew to faults assured
[p]And brought to medicine a healthful state
[p]Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:
[p]But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,
[p]Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
"
"What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
[p]Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
[p]Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,
[p]Still losing when I saw myself to win!
[p]What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
[p]Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
[p]How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
[p]In the distraction of this madding fever!
[p]O benefit of ill! now I find true
[p]That better is by evil still made better;
[p]And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
[p]Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
[p]So I return rebuked to my content
[p]And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.
"
"That you were once unkind befriends me now,
[p]And for that sorrow which I then did feel
[p]Needs must I under my transgression bow,
[p]Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
[p]For if you were by my unkindness shaken
[p]As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,
[p]And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
[p]To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
[p]O, that our night of woe might have remember'd
[p]My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
[p]And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
[p]The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!
[p]But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
[p]Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
"
"'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,
[p]When not to be receives reproach of being,
[p]And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd
[p]Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:
[p]For why should others false adulterate eyes
[p]Give salutation to my sportive blood?
[p]Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
[p]Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
[p]No, I am that I am, and they that level
[p]At my abuses reckon up their own:
[p]I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;
[p]By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;
[p]Unless this general evil they maintain,
[p]All men are bad, and in their badness reign.
"
"Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
[p]Full character'd with lasting memory,
[p]Which shall above that idle rank remain
[p]Beyond all date, even to eternity;
[p]Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
[p]Have faculty by nature to subsist;
[p]Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
[p]Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
[p]That poor retention could not so much hold,
[p]Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
[p]Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
[p]To trust those tables that receive thee more:
[p]To keep an adjunct to remember thee
[p]Were to import forgetfulness in me.
"
"No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
[p]Thy pyramids built up with newer might
[p]To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
[p]They are but dressings of a former sight.
[p]Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
[p]What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
[p]And rather make them born to our desire
[p]Than think that we before have heard them told.
[p]Thy registers and thee I both defy,
[p]Not wondering at the present nor the past,
[p]For thy records and what we see doth lie,
[p]Made more or less by thy continual haste.
[p]This I do vow and this shall ever be;
[p]I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.
"
"If my dear love were but the child of state,
[p]It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'
[p]As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
[p]Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
[p]No, it was builded far from accident;
[p]It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
[p]Under the blow of thralled discontent,
[p]Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:
[p]It fears not policy, that heretic,
[p]Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,
[p]But all alone stands hugely politic,
[p]That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.
[p]To this I witness call the fools of time,
[p]Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
"
"Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,
[p]With my extern the outward honouring,
[p]Or laid great bases for eternity,
[p]Which prove more short than waste or ruining?
[p]Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
[p]Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,
[p]For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,
[p]Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
[p]No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
[p]And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
[p]Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
[p]But mutual render, only me for thee.
[p]Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul
[p]When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.
"
"O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
[p]Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;
[p]Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
[p]Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;
[p]If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
[p]As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
[p]She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
[p]May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
[p]Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
[p]She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
[p]Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,
[p]And her quietus is to render thee.

"In the old age black was not counted fair,
[p]Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
[p]But now is black beauty's successive heir,
[p]And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
[p]For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
[p]Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,
[p]Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
[p]But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
[p]Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,
[p]Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
[p]At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
[p]Slandering creation with a false esteem:
[p]Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,
[p]That every tongue says beauty should look so.
"
"How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,
[p]Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
[p]With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st
[p]The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
[p]Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
[p]To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
[p]Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,
[p]At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
[p]To be so tickled, they would change their state
[p]And situation with those dancing chips,
[p]O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
[p]Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
[p]Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
[p]Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
"
"The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
[p]Is lust in action; and till action, lust
[p]Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
[p]Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
[p]Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,
[p]Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
[p]Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait
[p]On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
[p]Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
[p]Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
[p]A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;
[p]Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.
[p]All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
[p]To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
"
"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
[p]Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
[p]If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
[p]If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
[p]I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
[p]But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
[p]And in some perfumes is there more delight
[p]Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
[p]I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
[p]That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
[p]I grant I never saw a goddess go;
[p]My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
[p]And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
[p]As any she belied with false compare.
"
"Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
[p]As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
[p]For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
[p]Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
[p]Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold
[p]Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:
[p]To say they err I dare not be so bold,
[p]Although I swear it to myself alone.
[p]And, to be sure that is not false I swear,
[p]A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
[p]One on another's neck, do witness bear
[p]Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
[p]In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
[p]And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.
"
"Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
[p]Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,
[p]Have put on black and loving mourners be,
[p]Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
[p]And truly not the morning sun of heaven
[p]Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
[p]Nor that full star that ushers in the even
[p]Doth half that glory to the sober west,
[p]As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
[p]O, let it then as well beseem thy heart
[p]To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,
[p]And suit thy pity like in every part.
[p]Then will I swear beauty herself is black
[p]And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
"
"Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
[p]For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
[p]Is't not enough to torture me alone,
[p]But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
[p]Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
[p]And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
[p]Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;
[p]A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.
[p]Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
[p]But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
[p]Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
[p]Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:
[p]And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
[p]Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.
"
"So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
[p]And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
[p]Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
[p]Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:
[p]But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
[p]For thou art covetous and he is kind;
[p]He learn'd but surety-like to write for me
[p]Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
[p]The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
[p]Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,
[p]And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
[p]So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
[p]Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
[p]He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.
"
"Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'
[p]And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;
[p]More than enough am I that vex thee still,
[p]To thy sweet will making addition thus.
[p]Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
[p]Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
[p]Shall will in others seem right gracious,
[p]And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
[p]The sea all water, yet receives rain still
[p]And in abundance addeth to his store;
[p]So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
[p]One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.
[p]Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;
[p]Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'
"
"If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,
[p]Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'
[p]And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
[p]Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
[p]'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
[p]Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
[p]In things of great receipt with ease we prove
[p]Among a number one is reckon'd none:
[p]Then in the number let me pass untold,
[p]Though in thy stores' account I one must be;
[p]For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
[p]That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:
[p]Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
[p]And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'
"
"Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
[p]That they behold, and see not what they see?
[p]They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
[p]Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
[p]If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
[p]Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
[p]Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
[p]Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
[p]Why should my heart think that a several plot
[p]Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
[p]Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,
[p]To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
[p]In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
[p]And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.
"
"When my love swears that she is made of truth
[p]I do believe her, though I know she lies,
[p]That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
[p]Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
[p]Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
[p]Although she knows my days are past the best,
[p]Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:
[p]On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.
[p]But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
[p]And wherefore say not I that I am old?
[p]O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
[p]And age in love loves not to have years told:
[p]Therefore I lie with her and she with me,
[p]And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.
"
"O, call not me to justify the wrong
[p]That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
[p]Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
[p]Use power with power and slay me not by art.
[p]Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,
[p]Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
[p]What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
[p]Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?
[p]Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
[p]Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
[p]And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
[p]That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
[p]Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
[p]Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.
"
"Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
[p]My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
[p]Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
[p]The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
[p]If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
[p]Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;
[p]As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
[p]No news but health from their physicians know;
[p]For if I should despair, I should grow mad,
[p]And in my madness might speak ill of thee:
[p]Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
[p]Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,
[p]That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
[p]Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.
"
"In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
[p]For they in thee a thousand errors note;
[p]But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
[p]Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
[p]Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,
[p]Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
[p]Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
[p]To any sensual feast with thee alone:
[p]But my five wits nor my five senses can
[p]Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
[p]Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
[p]Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:
[p]Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
[p]That she that makes me sin awards me pain.
"
"Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,
[p]Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
[p]O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
[p]And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
[p]Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
[p]That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
[p]And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
[p]Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
[p]Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those
[p]Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
[p]Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
[p]Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
[p]If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
[p]By self-example mayst thou be denied!
"
"Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch
[p]One of her feather'd creatures broke away,
[p]Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
[p]In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,
[p]Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
[p]Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
[p]To follow that which flies before her face,
[p]Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
[p]So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
[p]Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
[p]But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
[p]And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:
[p]So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
[p]If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.
"
"Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
[p]Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
[p]The better angel is a man right fair,
[p]The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
[p]To win me soon to hell, my female evil
[p]Tempteth my better angel from my side,
[p]And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
[p]Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
[p]And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
[p]Suspect I may, but not directly tell;
[p]But being both from me, both to each friend,
[p]I guess one angel in another's hell:
[p]Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
[p]Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
"
"Those lips that Love's own hand did make
[p]Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
[p]To me that languish'd for her sake;
[p]But when she saw my woeful state,
[p]Straight in her heart did mercy come,
[p]Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
[p]Was used in giving gentle doom,
[p]And taught it thus anew to greet:
[p]'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
[p]That follow'd it as gentle day
[p]Doth follow night, who like a fiend
[p]From heaven to hell is flown away;
[p]'I hate' from hate away she threw,
[p]And saved my life, saying 'not you.'

"Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
[p][         ] these rebel powers that thee array;

[p]Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
[p]Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
[p]Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
[p]Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
[p]Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
[p]And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
[p]Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
[p]Within be fed, without be rich no more:
[p]So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
[p]And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.
"
"My love is as a fever, longing still
[p]For that which longer nurseth the disease,
[p]Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
[p]The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
[p]My reason, the physician to my love,
[p]Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
[p]Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
[p]Desire is death, which physic did except.
[p]Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
[p]And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
[p]My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
[p]At random from the truth vainly express'd;
[p]For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,
[p]Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
"
"O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,
[p]Which have no correspondence with true sight!
[p]Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
[p]That censures falsely what they see aright?
[p]If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
[p]What means the world to say it is not so?
[p]If it be not, then love doth well denote
[p]Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'
[p]How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,
[p]That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
[p]No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
[p]The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
[p]O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
[p]Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
"
"Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
[p]When I against myself with thee partake?
[p]Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
[p]Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?
[p]Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?
[p]On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
[p]Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
[p]Revenge upon myself with present moan?
[p]What merit do I in myself respect,
[p]That is so proud thy service to despise,
[p]When all my best doth worship thy defect,
[p]Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
[p]But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
[p]Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.
"
"O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
[p]With insufficiency my heart to sway?
[p]To make me give the lie to my true sight,
[p]And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
[p]Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
[p]That in the very refuse of thy deeds
[p]There is such strength and warrantize of skill
[p]That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
[p]Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
[p]The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
[p]O, though I love what others do abhor,
[p]With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
[p]If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
[p]More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
"
"Love is too young to know what conscience is;
[p]Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
[p]Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
[p]Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
[p]For, thou betraying me, I do betray
[p]My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
[p]My soul doth tell my body that he may
[p]Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;
[p]But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee
[p]As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
[p]He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
[p]To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
[p]No want of conscience hold it that I call
[p]Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.
"
"In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
[p]But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,
[p]In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
[p]In vowing new hate after new love bearing.
[p]But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
[p]When I break twenty? I am perjured most;
[p]For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
[p]And all my honest faith in thee is lost,
[p]For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
[p]Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
[p]And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
[p]Or made them swear against the thing they see;
[p]For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,
[p]To swear against the truth so foul a lie!
"
"Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:
[p]A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
[p]And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
[p]In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
[p]Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
[p]A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
[p]And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
[p]Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
[p]But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
[p]The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
[p]I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
[p]And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
[p]But found no cure: the bath for my help lies
[p]Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.
"
"The little Love-god lying once asleep
[p]Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
[p]Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
[p]Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
[p]The fairest votary took up that fire
[p]Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
[p]And so the general of hot desire
[p]Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
[p]This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
[p]Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
[p]Growing a bath and healthful remedy
[p]For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
[p]Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
[p]Love's fire heats water, water cools not love."
