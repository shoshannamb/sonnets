"Nay, but this dotage of our general's
[p]O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
[p]That o'er the files and musters of the war
[p]Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
[p]The office and devotion of their view
[p]Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
[p]Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
[p]The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
[p]And is become the bellows and the fan
[p]To cool a gipsy's lust.
[p][Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,]
[p]the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her]
[p]Look, where they come:
[p]Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
[p]The triple pillar of the world transform'd
[p]Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.
"
"If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
"
"There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
"
"I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
"
"Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
"
"News, my good lord, from Rome.
"
"Grates me: the sum.
"
"Nay, hear them, Antony:
[p]Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
[p]If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
[p]His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
[p]Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
[p]Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
"
"How, my love!
"
"Perchance! nay, and most like:
[p]You must not stay here longer, your dismission
[p]Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
[p]Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
[p]Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
[p]Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
[p]Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
[p]When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
"
"Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
[p]Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
[p]Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
[p]Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
[p]Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
[p][Embracing]
[p]And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
[p]On pain of punishment, the world to weet
[p]We stand up peerless.
"
"Excellent falsehood!
[p]Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
[p]I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
[p]Will be himself.
"
"But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
[p]Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
[p]Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
[p]There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
[p]Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
"
"Hear the ambassadors.
"
"Fie, wrangling queen!
[p]Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
[p]To weep; whose every passion fully strives
[p]To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
[p]No messenger, but thine; and all alone
[p]To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
[p]The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
[p]Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
[p][Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with]
[p]their train]
"
"Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
"
"Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
[p]He comes too short of that great property
[p]Which still should go with Antony.
"
"I am full sorry
[p]That he approves the common liar, who
[p]Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
[p]Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
"
"Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
[p]almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
[p]that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
[p]this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
[p]with garlands!
"
"Soothsayer!
"
"Your will?
"
"Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
"
"In nature's infinite book of secrecy
[p]A little I can read.
"
"Show him your hand.
"
"Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
[p]Cleopatra's health to drink.
"
"Good sir, give me good fortune.
"
"I make not, but foresee.
"
"Pray, then, foresee me one.
"
"You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
"
"He means in flesh.
"
"No, you shall paint when you are old.
"
"Wrinkles forbid!
"
"Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
"
"Hush!
"
"You shall be more beloving than beloved.
"
"I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
"
"Nay, hear him.
"
"Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
[p]to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
[p]let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
[p]may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
[p]Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
"
"You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
"
"O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
"
"You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
[p]Than that which is to approach.
"
"Then belike my children shall have no names:
[p]prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
"
"If every of your wishes had a womb.
[p]And fertile every wish, a million.
"
"Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
"
"You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
"
"Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
"
"We'll know all our fortunes.
"
"Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
[p]be--drunk to bed.
"
"There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
"
"E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
"
"Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
"
"Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
[p]prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
[p]tell her but a worky-day fortune.
"
"Your fortunes are alike.
"
"But how, but how? give me particulars.
"
"I have said.
"
"Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
"
"Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
[p]I, where would you choose it?
"
"Not in my husband's nose.
"
"Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
[p]his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
[p]that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
[p]her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
[p]follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
[p]laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
[p]Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
[p]matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
"
"Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
[p]for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
[p]loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
[p]foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
[p]decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
"
"Amen.
"
"Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
[p]cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
[p]they'ld do't!
"
"Hush! here comes Antony.
"
"Not he; the queen.
"
"Saw you my lord?
"
"No, lady.
"
"Was he not here?
"
"No, madam.
"
"He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
[p]A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
"
"Madam?
"
"Seek him, and bring him hither.
[p]Where's Alexas?
"
"Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
"
"We will not look upon him: go with us.
"
"Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
"
"Against my brother Lucius?
"
"Ay:
[p]But soon that war had end, and the time's state
[p]Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;
[p]Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,
[p]Upon the first encounter, drave them.
"
"Well, what worst?
"
"The nature of bad news infects the teller.
"
"When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
[p]Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
[p]Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
[p]I hear him as he flatter'd.
"
"Labienus--
[p]This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,
[p]Extended Asia from Euphrates;
[p]His conquering banner shook from Syria
[p]To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--
"
"Antony, thou wouldst say,--
"
"O, my lord!
"
"Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
[p]Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
[p]Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
[p]With such full licence as both truth and malice
[p]Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
[p]When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us
[p]Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
"
"At your noble pleasure.
"
"From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
"
"The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?
"
"He stays upon your will.
"
"Let him appear.
[p]These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
[p]Or lose myself in dotage.
[p][Enter another Messenger]
[p]What are you?
"
"Fulvia thy wife is dead.
"
"Where died she?
"
"In Sicyon:
[p]Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
[p]Importeth thee to know, this bears.
"
"Forbear me.
[p][Exit Second Messenger]
[p]There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
[p]What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
[p]We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
[p]By revolution lowering, does become
[p]The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
[p]The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
[p]I must from this enchanting queen break off:
[p]Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
[p]My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
"
"What's your pleasure, sir?
"
"I must with haste from hence.
"
"Why, then, we kill all our women:
[p]we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
[p]if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
"
"I must be gone.
"
"Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
[p]pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
[p]them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
[p]nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
[p]this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
[p]times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
[p]mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
[p]her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
"
"She is cunning past man's thought.
"
"Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
[p]the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
[p]winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
[p]storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
[p]cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
[p]shower of rain as well as Jove.
"
"Would I had never seen her.
"
"O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
[p]of work; which not to have been blest withal would
[p]have discredited your travel.
"
"Fulvia is dead.
"
"Sir?
"
"Fulvia is dead.
"
"Fulvia!
"
"Dead.
"
"Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
[p]it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
[p]from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
[p]comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
[p]out, there are members to make new. If there were
[p]no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
[p]and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
[p]with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
[p]petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
[p]that should water this sorrow.
"
"The business she hath broached in the state
[p]Cannot endure my absence.
"
"And the business you have broached here cannot be
[p]without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
[p]wholly depends on your abode.
"
"No more light answers. Let our officers
[p]Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
[p]The cause of our expedience to the queen,
[p]And get her leave to part. For not alone
[p]The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
[p]Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
[p]Of many our contriving friends in Rome
[p]Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
[p]Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
[p]The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
[p]Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
[p]Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
[p]Pompey the Great and all his dignities
[p]Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
[p]Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
[p]For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
[p]The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
[p]Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
[p]And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
[p]To such whose place is under us, requires
[p]Our quick remove from hence.
"
"I shall do't.
"
"Where is he?
"
"I did not see him since.
"
"See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
[p]I did not send you: if you find him sad,
[p]Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
[p]That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.
"
"Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
[p]You do not hold the method to enforce
[p]The like from him.
"
"What should I do, I do not?
"
"In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.
"
"Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.
"
"Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
[p]In time we hate that which we often fear.
[p]But here comes Antony.
"
"I am sick and sullen.
"
"I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--
"
"Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:
[p]It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
[p]Will not sustain it.
"
"Now, my dearest queen,--
"
"Pray you, stand further from me.
"
"What's the matter?
"
"I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
[p]What says the married woman? You may go:
[p]Would she had never given you leave to come!
[p]Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
[p]I have no power upon you; hers you are.
"
"The gods best know,--
"
"O, never was there queen
[p]So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
[p]I saw the treasons planted.
"
"Cleopatra,--
"
"Why should I think you can be mine and true,
[p]Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
[p]Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
[p]To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
[p]Which break themselves in swearing!
"
"Most sweet queen,--
"
"Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
[p]But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
[p]Then was the time for words: no going then;
[p]Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
[p]Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,
[p]But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
[p]Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
[p]Art turn'd the greatest liar.
"
"How now, lady!
"
"I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
[p]There were a heart in Egypt.
"
"Hear me, queen:
[p]The strong necessity of time commands
[p]Our services awhile; but my full heart
[p]Remains in use with you. Our Italy
[p]Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
[p]Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
[p]Equality of two domestic powers
[p]Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
[p]Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,
[p]Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
[p]Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
[p]Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
[p]And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
[p]By any desperate change: my more particular,
[p]And that which most with you should safe my going,
[p]Is Fulvia's death.
"
"Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
[p]It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
"
"She's dead, my queen:
[p]Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
[p]The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:
[p]See when and where she died.
"
"O most false love!
[p]Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
[p]With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
[p]In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.
"
"Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
[p]The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
[p]As you shall give the advice. By the fire
[p]That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
[p]Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war
[p]As thou affect'st.
"
"Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
[p]But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,
[p]So Antony loves.
"
"My precious queen, forbear;
[p]And give true evidence to his love, which stands
[p]An honourable trial.
"
"So Fulvia told me.
[p]I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,
[p]Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
[p]Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
[p]Of excellent dissembling; and let it look
[p]Life perfect honour.
"
"You'll heat my blood: no more.
"
"You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
"
"Now, by my sword,--
"
"And target. Still he mends;
[p]But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
[p]How this Herculean Roman does become
[p]The carriage of his chafe.
"
"I'll leave you, lady.
"
"Courteous lord, one word.
[p]Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
[p]Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
[p]That you know well: something it is I would,
[p]O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
[p]And I am all forgotten.
"
"But that your royalty
[p]Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
[p]For idleness itself.
"
"'Tis sweating labour
[p]To bear such idleness so near the heart
[p]As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
[p]Since my becomings kill me, when they do not
[p]Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
[p]Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
[p]And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
[p]Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
[p]Be strew'd before your feet!
"
"Let us go. Come;
[p]Our separation so abides, and flies,
[p]That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
[p]And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!
"
"You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
[p]It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
[p]Our great competitor: from Alexandria
[p]This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
[p]The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like
[p]Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy
[p]More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
[p]Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
[p]A man who is the abstract of all faults
[p]That all men follow.
"
"I must not think there are
[p]Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
[p]His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
[p]More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,
[p]Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
[p]Than what he chooses.
"
"You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not
[p]Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;
[p]To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
[p]And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
[p]To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
[p]With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
[p]becomes him,--
[p]As his composure must be rare indeed
[p]Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony
[p]No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
[p]So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
[p]His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
[p]Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
[p]Call on him for't: but to confound such time,
[p]That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
[p]As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid
[p]As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
[p]Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
[p]And so rebel to judgment.
"
"Here's more news.
"
"Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
[p]Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
[p]How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;
[p]And it appears he is beloved of those
[p]That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
[p]The discontents repair, and men's reports
[p]Give him much wrong'd.
"
"I should have known no less.
[p]It hath been taught us from the primal state,
[p]That he which is was wish'd until he were;
[p]And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
[p]Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
[p]Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
[p]Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
[p]To rot itself with motion.
"
"Caesar, I bring thee word,
[p]Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
[p]Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
[p]With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
[p]They make in Italy; the borders maritime
[p]Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
[p]No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
[p]Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
[p]Than could his war resisted.
"
"Antony,
[p]Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
[p]Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
[p]Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
[p]Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
[p]Though daintily brought up, with patience more
[p]Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
[p]The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
[p]Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
[p]The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
[p]Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
[p]The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
[p]It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
[p]Which some did die to look on: and all this--
[p]It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
[p]Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
[p]So much as lank'd not.
"
"'Tis pity of him.
"
"Let his shames quickly
[p]Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
[p]Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end
[p]Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
[p]Thrives in our idleness.
"
"To-morrow, Caesar,
[p]I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
[p]Both what by sea and land I can be able
[p]To front this present time.
"
"Till which encounter,
[p]It is my business too. Farewell.
"
"Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime
[p]Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
[p]To let me be partaker.
"
"Doubt not, sir;
[p]I knew it for my bond.
"
"Charmian!
"
"Madam?
"
"Ha, ha!
[p]Give me to drink mandragora.
"
"Why, madam?
"
"That I might sleep out this great gap of time
[p]My Antony is away.
"
"You think of him too much.
"
"O, 'tis treason!
"
"Madam, I trust, not so.
"
"Thou, eunuch Mardian!
"
"What's your highness' pleasure?
"
"Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
[p]In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,
[p]That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
[p]May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
"
"Yes, gracious madam.
"
"Indeed!
"
"Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
[p]But what indeed is honest to be done:
[p]Yet have I fierce affections, and think
[p]What Venus did with Mars.
"
"O Charmian,
[p]Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
[p]Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
[p]O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
[p]Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?
[p]The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
[p]And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
[p]Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
[p]For so he calls me: now I feed myself
[p]With most delicious poison. Think on me,
[p]That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
[p]And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
[p]When thou wast here above the ground, I was
[p]A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
[p]Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
[p]There would he anchor his aspect and die
[p]With looking on his life.
"
"Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
"
"How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
[p]Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
[p]With his tinct gilded thee.
[p]How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
"
"Last thing he did, dear queen,
[p]He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--
[p]This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
"
"Mine ear must pluck it thence.
"
"'Good friend,' quoth he,
[p]'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
[p]This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
[p]To mend the petty present, I will piece
[p]Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
[p]Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
[p]And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
[p]Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke
[p]Was beastly dumb'd by him.
"
"What, was he sad or merry?
"
"Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
[p]Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
"
"O well-divided disposition! Note him,
[p]Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
[p]He was not sad, for he would shine on those
[p]That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
[p]Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
[p]In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
[p]O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
[p]The violence of either thee becomes,
[p]So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
"
"Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:
[p]Why do you send so thick?
"
"Who's born that day
[p]When I forget to send to Antony,
[p]Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
[p]Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
[p]Ever love Caesar so?
"
"O that brave Caesar!
"
"Be choked with such another emphasis!
[p]Say, the brave Antony.
"
"The valiant Caesar!
"
"By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
[p]If thou with Caesar paragon again
[p]My man of men.
"
"By your most gracious pardon,
[p]I sing but after you.
"
"My salad days,
[p]When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,
[p]To say as I said then! But, come, away;
[p]Get me ink and paper:
[p]He shall have every day a several greeting,
[p]Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
"
"If the great gods be just, they shall assist
[p]The deeds of justest men.
"
"Know, worthy Pompey,
[p]That what they do delay, they not deny.
"
"Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
[p]The thing we sue for.
"
"We, ignorant of ourselves,
[p]Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
[p]Deny us for our good; so find we profit
[p]By losing of our prayers.
"
"I shall do well:
[p]The people love me, and the sea is mine;
[p]My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
[p]Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
[p]In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
[p]No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
[p]He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
[p]Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
[p]Nor either cares for him.
"
"Caesar and Lepidus
[p]Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
"
"Where have you this? 'tis false.
"
"From Silvius, sir.
"
"He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,
[p]Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
[p]Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
[p]Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
[p]Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
[p]Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks
[p]Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;
[p]That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
[p]Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
[p][Enter VARRIUS]
[p]How now, Varrius!
"
"This is most certain that I shall deliver:
[p]Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
[p]Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
[p]A space for further travel.
"
"I could have given less matter
[p]A better ear. Menas, I did not think
[p]This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
[p]For such a petty war: his soldiership
[p]Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
[p]The higher our opinion, that our stirring
[p]Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
[p]The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
"
"I cannot hope
[p]Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
[p]His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
[p]His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
[p]Not moved by Antony.
"
"I know not, Menas,
[p]How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
[p]Were't not that we stand up against them all,
[p]'Twere pregnant they should square between
[p]themselves;
[p]For they have entertained cause enough
[p]To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
[p]May cement their divisions and bind up
[p]The petty difference, we yet not know.
[p]Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
[p]Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
[p]Come, Menas.
"
"Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
[p]And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
[p]To soft and gentle speech.
"
"I shall entreat him
[p]To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,
[p]Let Antony look over Caesar's head
[p]And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
[p]Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
[p]I would not shave't to-day.
"
"'Tis not a time
[p]For private stomaching.
"
"Every time
[p]Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
"
"But small to greater matters must give way.
"
"Not if the small come first.
"
"Your speech is passion:
[p]But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
[p]The noble Antony.
"
"And yonder, Caesar.
"
"If we compose well here, to Parthia:
[p]Hark, Ventidius.
"
"I do not know,
[p]Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.
"
"Noble friends,
[p]That which combined us was most great, and let not
[p]A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
[p]May it be gently heard: when we debate
[p]Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
[p]Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,
[p]The rather, for I earnestly beseech,
[p]Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
[p]Nor curstness grow to the matter.
"
"'Tis spoken well.
[p]Were we before our armies, and to fight.
[p]I should do thus.
"
"Welcome to Rome.
"
"Thank you.
"
"Sit.
"
"Sit, sir.
"
"Nay, then.
"
"I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
[p]Or being, concern you not.
"
"I must be laugh'd at,
[p]If, or for nothing or a little, I
[p]Should say myself offended, and with you
[p]Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should
[p]Once name you derogately, when to sound your name
[p]It not concern'd me.
"
"My being in Egypt, Caesar,
[p]What was't to you?
"
"No more than my residing here at Rome
[p]Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there
[p]Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
[p]Might be my question.
"
"How intend you, practised?
"
"You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
[p]By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother
[p]Made wars upon me; and their contestation
[p]Was theme for you, you were the word of war.
"
"You do mistake your business; my brother never
[p]Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
[p]And have my learning from some true reports,
[p]That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
[p]Discredit my authority with yours;
[p]And make the wars alike against my stomach,
[p]Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
[p]Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
[p]As matter whole you have not to make it with,
[p]It must not be with this.
"
"You praise yourself
[p]By laying defects of judgment to me; but
[p]You patch'd up your excuses.
"
"Not so, not so;
[p]I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
[p]Very necessity of this thought, that I,
[p]Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
[p]Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
[p]Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
[p]I would you had her spirit in such another:
[p]The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle
[p]You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
"
"Would we had all such wives, that the men might go
[p]to wars with the women!
"
"So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar
[p]Made out of her impatience, which not wanted
[p]Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant
[p]Did you too much disquiet: for that you must
[p]But say, I could not help it.
"
"I wrote to you
[p]When rioting in Alexandria; you
[p]Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
[p]Did gibe my missive out of audience.
"
"Sir,
[p]He fell upon me ere admitted: then
[p]Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
[p]Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
[p]I told him of myself; which was as much
[p]As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
[p]Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
[p]Out of our question wipe him.
"
"You have broken
[p]The article of your oath; which you shall never
[p]Have tongue to charge me with.
"
"Soft, Caesar!
"
"No,
[p]Lepidus, let him speak:
[p]The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
[p]Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;
[p]The article of my oath.
"
"To lend me arms and aid when I required them;
[p]The which you both denied.
"
"Neglected, rather;
[p]And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
[p]From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
[p]I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
[p]Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
[p]Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
[p]To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
[p]For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
[p]So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
[p]To stoop in such a case.
"
"'Tis noble spoken.
"
"If it might please you, to enforce no further
[p]The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
[p]Were to remember that the present need
[p]Speaks to atone you.
"
"Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.
"
"Or, if you borrow one another's love for the
[p]instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
[p]Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
[p]wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
"
"Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
"
"That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
"
"You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
"
"Go to, then; your considerate stone.
"
"I do not much dislike the matter, but
[p]The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
[p]We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
[p]So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
[p]What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
[p]O' the world I would pursue it.
"
"Give me leave, Caesar,--
"
"Speak, Agrippa.
"
"Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
[p]Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
[p]Is now a widower.
"
"Say not so, Agrippa:
[p]If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
[p]Were well deserved of rashness.
"
"I am not married, Caesar: let me hear
[p]Agrippa further speak.
"
"To hold you in perpetual amity,
[p]To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
[p]With an unslipping knot, take Antony
[p]Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
[p]No worse a husband than the best of men;
[p]Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
[p]That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
[p]All little jealousies, which now seem great,
[p]And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
[p]Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
[p]Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
[p]Would, each to other and all loves to both,
[p]Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
[p]For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
[p]By duty ruminated.
"
"Will Caesar speak?
"
"Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
[p]With what is spoke already.
"
"What power is in Agrippa,
[p]If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
[p]To make this good?
"
"The power of Caesar, and
[p]His power unto Octavia.
"
"May I never
[p]To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
[p]Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:
[p]Further this act of grace: and from this hour
[p]The heart of brothers govern in our loves
[p]And sway our great designs!
"
"There is my hand.
[p]A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
[p]Did ever love so dearly: let her live
[p]To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
[p]Fly off our loves again!
"
"Happily, amen!
"
"I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
[p]For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
[p]Of late upon me: I must thank him only,
[p]Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
[p]At heel of that, defy him.
"
"Time calls upon's:
[p]Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
[p]Or else he seeks out us.
"
"Where lies he?
"
"About the mount Misenum.
"
"What is his strength by land?
"
"Great and increasing: but by sea
[p]He is an absolute master.
"
"So is the fame.
[p]Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:
[p]Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
[p]The business we have talk'd of.
"
"With most gladness:
[p]And do invite you to my sister's view,
[p]Whither straight I'll lead you.
"
"Let us, Lepidus,
[p]Not lack your company.
"
"Noble Antony,
[p]Not sickness should detain me.
[p][Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY,]
[p]and LEPIDUS]
"
"Welcome from Egypt, sir.
"
"Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My
[p]honourable friend, Agrippa!
"
"Good Enobarbus!
"
"We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
[p]digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
"
"Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and
[p]made the night light with drinking.
"
"Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and
[p]but twelve persons there; is this true?
"
"This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
[p]monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
"
"She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to
[p]her.
"
"When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
[p]his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
"
"There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised
[p]well for her.
"
"I will tell you.
[p]The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
[p]Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
[p]Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
[p]The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
[p]Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
[p]The water which they beat to follow faster,
[p]As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
[p]It beggar'd all description: she did lie
[p]In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
[p]O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
[p]The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
[p]Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
[p]With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
[p]To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
[p]And what they undid did.
"
"O, rare for Antony!
"
"Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
[p]So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
[p]And made their bends adornings: at the helm
[p]A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
[p]Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
[p]That yarely frame the office. From the barge
[p]A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
[p]Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
[p]Her people out upon her; and Antony,
[p]Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,
[p]Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
[p]Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
[p]And made a gap in nature.
"
"Rare Egyptian!
"
"Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
[p]Invited her to supper: she replied,
[p]It should be better he became her guest;
[p]Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
[p]Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
[p]Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
[p]And for his ordinary pays his heart
[p]For what his eyes eat only.
"
"Royal wench!
[p]She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
[p]He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
"
"I saw her once
[p]Hop forty paces through the public street;
[p]And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
[p]That she did make defect perfection,
[p]And, breathless, power breathe forth.
"
"Now Antony must leave her utterly.
"
"Never; he will not:
[p]Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
[p]Her infinite variety: other women cloy
[p]The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
[p]Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
[p]Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
[p]Bless her when she is riggish.
"
"If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
[p]The heart of Antony, Octavia is
[p]A blessed lottery to him.
"
"Let us go.
[p]Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
[p]Whilst you abide here.
"
"Humbly, sir, I thank you.
"
"The world and my great office will sometimes
[p]Divide me from your bosom.
"
"All which time
[p]Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
[p]To them for you.
"
"Good night, sir. My Octavia,
[p]Read not my blemishes in the world's report:
[p]I have not kept my square; but that to come
[p]Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.
[p]Good night, sir.
"
"Good night.
"
"Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?
"
"Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!
"
"If you can, your reason?
"
"I see it in
[p]My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
[p]Hie you to Egypt again.
"
"Say to me,
[p]Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
"
"Caesar's.
[p]Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:
[p]Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is
[p]Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,
[p]Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel
[p]Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore
[p]Make space enough between you.
"
"Speak this no more.
"
"To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.
[p]If thou dost play with him at any game,
[p]Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,
[p]He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,
[p]When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit
[p]Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
[p]But, he away, 'tis noble.
"
"Get thee gone:
[p]Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:
[p][Exit Soothsayer]
[p]He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
[p]He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;
[p]And in our sports my better cunning faints
[p]Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
[p]His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
[p]When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
[p]Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:
[p]And though I make this marriage for my peace,
[p]I' the east my pleasure lies.
[p][Enter VENTIDIUS]
[p]O, come, Ventidius,
[p]You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;
[p]Follow me, and receive't.
"
"Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
[p]Your generals after.
"
"Sir, Mark Antony
[p]Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
"
"Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
[p]Which will become you both, farewell.
"
"We shall,
[p]As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
[p]Before you, Lepidus.
"
"Your way is shorter;
[p]My purposes do draw me much about:
[p]You'll win two days upon me.
"
"[with Agrippa] Sir, good success!
"
"Farewell.
"
"Give me some music; music, moody food
[p]Of us that trade in love.
"
"The music, ho!
"
"Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.
"
"My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
"
"As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
[p]As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
"
"As well as I can, madam.
"
"And when good will is show'd, though't come
[p]too short,
[p]The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:
[p]Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,
[p]My music playing far off, I will betray
[p]Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
[p]Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
[p]I'll think them every one an Antony,
[p]And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'
"
"'Twas merry when
[p]You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
[p]Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
[p]With fervency drew up.
"
"That time,--O times!--
[p]I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
[p]I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
[p]Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
[p]Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
[p]I wore his sword Philippan.
[p][Enter a Messenger]
[p]O, from Italy
[p]Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
[p]That long time have been barren.
"
"Madam, madam,--
"
"Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,
[p]Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,
[p]If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
[p]My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
[p]Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
"
"First, madam, he is well.
"
"Why, there's more gold.
[p]But, sirrah, mark, we use
[p]To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
[p]The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
[p]Down thy ill-uttering throat.
"
"Good madam, hear me.
"
"Well, go to, I will;
[p]But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
[p]Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour
[p]To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
[p]Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
[p]Not like a formal man.
"
"Will't please you hear me?
"
"I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
[p]Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
[p]Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
[p]I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
[p]Rich pearls upon thee.
"
"Madam, he's well.
"
"Well said.
"
"And friends with Caesar.
"
"Thou'rt an honest man.
"
"Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
"
"Make thee a fortune from me.
"
"But yet, madam,--
"
"I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
[p]The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
[p]'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
[p]Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
[p]Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
[p]The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:
[p]In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.
"
"Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
[p]He's bound unto Octavia.
"
"For what good turn?
"
"For the best turn i' the bed.
"
"I am pale, Charmian.
"
"Madam, he's married to Octavia.
"
"The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
"
"Good madam, patience.
"
"What say you? Hence,
[p][Strikes him again]
[p]Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
[p]Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
[p][She hales him up and down]
[p]Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
[p]Smarting in lingering pickle.
"
"Gracious madam,
[p]I that do bring the news made not the match.
"
"Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
[p]And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
[p]Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
[p]And I will boot thee with what gift beside
[p]Thy modesty can beg.
"
"He's married, madam.
"
"Rogue, thou hast lived too long.
"
"Nay, then I'll run.
[p]What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
"
"Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
[p]The man is innocent.
"
"Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
[p]Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
[p]Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
[p]Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.
"
"He is afeard to come.
"
"I will not hurt him.
[p][Exit CHARMIAN]
[p]These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
[p]A meaner than myself; since I myself
[p]Have given myself the cause.
[p][Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger]
[p]Come hither, sir.
[p]Though it be honest, it is never good
[p]To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
[p]An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
[p]Themselves when they be felt.
"
"I have done my duty.
"
"Is he married?
[p]I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
[p]If thou again say 'Yes.'
"
"He's married, madam.
"
"The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?
"
"Should I lie, madam?
"
"O, I would thou didst,
[p]So half my Egypt were submerged and made
[p]A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:
[p]Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
[p]Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
"
"I crave your highness' pardon.
"
"He is married?
"
"Take no offence that I would not offend you:
[p]To punish me for what you make me do.
[p]Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.
"
"O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
[p]That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:
[p]The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
[p]Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,
[p]And be undone by 'em!
"
"Good your highness, patience.
"
"In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
"
"Many times, madam.
"
"I am paid for't now.
[p]Lead me from hence:
[p]I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.
[p]Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
[p]Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
[p]Her inclination, let him not leave out
[p]The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
[p][Exit ALEXAS]
[p]Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,
[p]Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
[p]The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas
[p][To MARDIAN]
[p]Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
[p]But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.
"
"Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
[p]And we shall talk before we fight.
"
"Most meet
[p]That first we come to words; and therefore have we
[p]Our written purposes before us sent;
[p]Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know
[p]If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
[p]And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
[p]That else must perish here.
"
"To you all three,
[p]The senators alone of this great world,
[p]Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
[p]Wherefore my father should revengers want,
[p]Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,
[p]Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
[p]There saw you labouring for him. What was't
[p]That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what
[p]Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
[p]With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,
[p]To drench the Capitol; but that they would
[p]Have one man but a man? And that is it
[p]Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen
[p]The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
[p]To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
[p]Cast on my noble father.
"
"Take your time.
"
"Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
[p]We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
[p]How much we do o'er-count thee.
"
"At land, indeed,
[p]Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:
[p]But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
[p]Remain in't as thou mayst.
"
"Be pleased to tell us--
[p]For this is from the present--how you take
[p]The offers we have sent you.
"
"There's the point.
"
"Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
[p]What it is worth embraced.
"
"And what may follow,
[p]To try a larger fortune.
"
"You have made me offer
[p]Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
[p]Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
[p]Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
[p]To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
[p]Our targes undinted.
"
"[with Antony and Lepidus] That's our offer.
"
"Know, then,
[p]I came before you here a man prepared
[p]To take this offer: but Mark Antony
[p]Put me to some impatience: though I lose
[p]The praise of it by telling, you must know,
[p]When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
[p]Your mother came to Sicily and did find
[p]Her welcome friendly.
"
"I have heard it, Pompey;
[p]And am well studied for a liberal thanks
[p]Which I do owe you.
"
"Let me have your hand:
[p]I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
"
"The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
[p]That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
[p]For I have gain'd by 't.
"
"Since I saw you last,
[p]There is a change upon you.
"
"Well, I know not
[p]What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
[p]But in my bosom shall she never come,
[p]To make my heart her vassal.
"
"Well met here.
"
"I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:
[p]I crave our composition may be written,
[p]And seal'd between us.
"
"That's the next to do.
"
"We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
[p]Draw lots who shall begin.
"
"That will I, Pompey.
"
"No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
[p]Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
[p]Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
[p]Grew fat with feasting there.
"
"You have heard much.
"
"I have fair meanings, sir.
"
"And fair words to them.
"
"Then so much have I heard:
[p]And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--
"
"No more of that: he did so.
"
"What, I pray you?
"
"A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
"
"I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?
"
"Well;
[p]And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
[p]Four feasts are toward.
"
"Let me shake thy hand;
[p]I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
[p]When I have envied thy behavior.
"
"Sir,
[p]I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,
[p]When you have well deserved ten times as much
[p]As I have said you did.
"
"Enjoy thy plainness,
[p]It nothing ill becomes thee.
[p]Aboard my galley I invite you all:
[p]Will you lead, lords?
"
"[with Antony and Lepidus]
"
"Come.
"
"[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
[p]made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.
"
"At sea, I think.
"
"We have, sir.
"
"You have done well by water.
"
"And you by land.
"
"I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
[p]cannot be denied what I have done by land.
"
"Nor what I have done by water.
"
"Yes, something you can deny for your own
[p]safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
"
"And you by land.
"
"There I deny my land service. But give me your
[p]hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
[p]might take two thieves kissing.
"
"All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
"
"But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
"
"No slander; they steal hearts.
"
"We came hither to fight with you.
"
"For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
[p]Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
"
"If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.
"
"You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
[p]here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
"
"Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
"
"True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
"
"But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
"
"Pray ye, sir?
"
"'Tis true.
"
"Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
"
"If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
[p]not prophesy so.
"
"I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
[p]marriage than the love of the parties.
"
"I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
[p]seems to tie their friendship together will be the
[p]very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
[p]holy, cold, and still conversation.
"
"Who would not have his wife so?
"
"Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
[p]He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
[p]sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
[p]I said before, that which is the strength of their
[p]amity shall prove the immediate author of their
[p]variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
[p]he married but his occasion here.
"
"And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
[p]I have a health for you.
"
"I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
"
"Come, let's away.
"
"Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
[p]ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
[p]will blow them down.
"
"Lepidus is high-coloured.
"
"They have made him drink alms-drink.
"
"As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
[p]cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his
[p]entreaty, and himself to the drink.
"
"But it raises the greater war between him and
[p]his discretion.
"
"Why, this is to have a name in great men's
[p]fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
[p]me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
"
"To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
[p]to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
[p]which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
[p][A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK]
[p]ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS,
[p]DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains]
"
"[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take
[p]the flow o' the Nile
[p]By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,
[p]By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
[p]Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
[p]The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
[p]Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
[p]And shortly comes to harvest.
"
"You've strange serpents there.
"
"Ay, Lepidus.
"
"Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
[p]operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.
"
"They are so.
"
"Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
"
"I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
"
"Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.
"
"Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
[p]pyramises are very goodly things; without
[p]contradiction, I have heard that.
"
"[Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
"
"[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear:
[p]what is't?
"
"[Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
[p]thee, captain,
[p]And hear me speak a word.
"
"[Aside to MENAS] Forbear me till anon.
[p]This wine for Lepidus!
"
"What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
"
"It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad
[p]as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
[p]and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
[p]which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
[p]it, it transmigrates.
"
"What colour is it of?
"
"Of it own colour too.
"
"'Tis a strange serpent.
"
"'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
"
"Will this description satisfy him?
"
"With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a
[p]very epicure.
"
"[Aside to MENAS] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
[p]that? away!
[p]Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
"
"[Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou
[p]wilt hear me,
[p]Rise from thy stool.
"
"[Aside to MENAS] I think thou'rt mad.
[p]The matter?
"
"I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
"
"Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
[p]Be jolly, lords.
"
"These quick-sands, Lepidus,
[p]Keep off them, for you sink.
"
"Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
"
"What say'st thou?
"
"Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
"
"How should that be?
"
"But entertain it,
[p]And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
[p]Will give thee all the world.
"
"Hast thou drunk well?
"
"Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
[p]Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:
[p]Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
[p]Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
"
"Show me which way.
"
"These three world-sharers, these competitors,
[p]Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
[p]And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
[p]All there is thine.
"
"Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
[p]And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;
[p]In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
[p]'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
[p]Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
[p]Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
[p]I should have found it afterwards well done;
[p]But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
"
"[Aside] For this,
[p]I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
[p]Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
[p]Shall never find it more.
"
"This health to Lepidus!
"
"Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
"
"Here's to thee, Menas!
"
"Enobarbus, welcome!
"
"Fill till the cup be hid.
"
"There's a strong fellow, Menas.
"
"Why?
"
"A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
[p]not?
"
"The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
[p]That it might go on wheels!
"
"Drink thou; increase the reels.
"
"Come.
"
"This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
"
"It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
[p]Here is to Caesar!
"
"I could well forbear't.
[p]It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
[p]And it grows fouler.
"
"Be a child o' the time.
"
"Possess it, I'll make answer:
[p]But I had rather fast from all four days
[p]Than drink so much in one.
"
"Ha, my brave emperor!
[p][To MARK ANTONY]
[p]Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
[p]And celebrate our drink?
"
"Let's ha't, good soldier.
"
"Come, let's all take hands,
[p]Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
[p]In soft and delicate Lethe.
"
"All take hands.
[p]Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
[p]The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
[p]The holding every man shall bear as loud
[p]As his strong sides can volley.
[p][Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them]
[p]hand in hand]
[p]THE SONG.
[p]Come, thou monarch of the vine,
[p]Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
[p]In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
[p]With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
[p]Cup us, till the world go round,
[p]Cup us, till the world go round!
"
"What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
[p]Let me request you off: our graver business
[p]Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
[p]You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
[p]Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
[p]Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
[p]Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
[p]Good Antony, your hand.
"
"I'll try you on the shore.
"
"And shall, sir; give's your hand.
"
"O Antony,
[p]You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
[p]Come, down into the boat.
"
"Take heed you fall not.
[p][Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS]
[p]Menas, I'll not on shore.
"
"No, to my cabin.
[p]These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
[p]Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
[p]To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!
"
"Ho! says a' There's my cap.
"
"Ho! Noble captain, come.
"
"Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
[p]Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
[p]Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
[p]Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
[p]Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
"
"Noble Ventidius,
[p]Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
[p]The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
[p]Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
[p]The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
[p]Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
[p]Put garlands on thy head.
"
"O Silius, Silius,
[p]I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
[p]May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
[p]Better to leave undone, than by our deed
[p]Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
[p]Caesar and Antony have ever won
[p]More in their officer than person: Sossius,
[p]One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
[p]For quick accumulation of renown,
[p]Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
[p]Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
[p]Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
[p]The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
[p]Than gain which darkens him.
[p]I could do more to do Antonius good,
[p]But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
[p]Should my performance perish.
"
"Thou hast, Ventidius,
[p]that
[p]Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
[p]Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!
"
"I'll humbly signify what in his name,
[p]That magical word of war, we have effected;
[p]How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
[p]The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
[p]We have jaded out o' the field.
"
"Where is he now?
"
"He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
[p]The weight we must convey with's will permit,
[p]We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!
"
"What, are the brothers parted?
"
"They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
[p]The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
[p]To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
[p]Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
[p]With the green sickness.
"
"'Tis a noble Lepidus.
"
"A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!
"
"Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
"
"Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
"
"What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
"
"Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!
"
"O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
"
"Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.
"
"Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
"
"But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
[p]Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
[p]poets, cannot
[p]Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
[p]His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
[p]Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
"
"Both he loves.
"
"They are his shards, and he their beetle.
[p][Trumpets within]
[p]So;
[p]This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
"
"Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
"
"No further, sir.
"
"You take from me a great part of myself;
[p]Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
[p]As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
[p]Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
[p]Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
[p]Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
[p]To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
[p]The fortress of it; for better might we
[p]Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
[p]This be not cherish'd.
"
"Make me not offended
[p]In your distrust.
"
"I have said.
"
"You shall not find,
[p]Though you be therein curious, the least cause
[p]For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
[p]And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
[p]We will here part.
"
"Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
[p]The elements be kind to thee, and make
[p]Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.
"
"My noble brother!
"
"The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
[p]And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
"
"Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--
"
"What, Octavia?
"
"I'll tell you in your ear.
"
"Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
[p]Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
[p]down-feather,
[p]That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
[p]And neither way inclines.
"
"[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
"
"[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.
"
"[Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,
[p]were he a horse;
[p]So is he, being a man.
"
"[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
[p]When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
[p]He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
[p]When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
"
"[Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was
[p]troubled with a rheum;
[p]What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
[p]Believe't, till I wept too.
"
"No, sweet Octavia,
[p]You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
[p]Out-go my thinking on you.
"
"Come, sir, come;
[p]I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
[p]Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
[p]And give you to the gods.
"
"Adieu; be happy!
"
"Let all the number of the stars give light
[p]To thy fair way!
"
"Farewell, farewell!
"
"Farewell!
"
"Where is the fellow?
"
"Half afeard to come.
"
"Go to, go to.
[p][Enter the Messenger as before]
[p]Come hither, sir.
"
"Good majesty,
[p]Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
[p]But when you are well pleased.
"
"That Herod's head
[p]I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
[p]Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
"
"Most gracious majesty,--
"
"Didst thou behold Octavia?
"
"Ay, dread queen.
"
"Where?
"
"Madam, in Rome;
[p]I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
[p]Between her brother and Mark Antony.
"
"Is she as tall as me?
"
"She is not, madam.
"
"Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?
"
"Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.
"
"That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
"
"Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
"
"I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
[p]What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
[p]If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
"
"She creeps:
[p]Her motion and her station are as one;
[p]She shows a body rather than a life,
[p]A statue than a breather.
"
"Is this certain?
"
"Or I have no observance.
"
"Three in Egypt
[p]Cannot make better note.
"
"He's very knowing;
[p]I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
[p]The fellow has good judgment.
"
"Excellent.
"
"Guess at her years, I prithee.
"
"Madam,
[p]She was a widow,--
"
"Widow! Charmian, hark.
"
"And I do think she's thirty.
"
"Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
"
"Round even to faultiness.
"
"For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
[p]Her hair, what colour?
"
"Brown, madam: and her forehead
[p]As low as she would wish it.
"
"There's gold for thee.
[p]Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
[p]I will employ thee back again; I find thee
[p]Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
[p]Our letters are prepared.
"
"A proper man.
"
"Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
[p]That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
[p]This creature's no such thing.
"
"Nothing, madam.
"
"The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
"
"Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
[p]And serving you so long!
"
"I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
[p]But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
[p]Where I will write. All may be well enough.
"
"I warrant you, madam.
"
"Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
[p]That were excusable, that, and thousands more
[p]Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
[p]New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
[p]To public ear:
[p]Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
[p]But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
[p]He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:
[p]When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
[p]Or did it from his teeth.
"
"O my good lord,
[p]Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
[p]Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
[p]If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
[p]Praying for both parts:
[p]The good gods me presently,
[p]When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'
[p]Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
[p]'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
[p]Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
[p]'Twixt these extremes at all.
"
"Gentle Octavia,
[p]Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
[p]Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,
[p]I lose myself: better I were not yours
[p]Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
[p]Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,
[p]I'll raise the preparation of a war
[p]Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;
[p]So your desires are yours.
"
"Thanks to my lord.
[p]The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
[p]Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
[p]As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
[p]Should solder up the rift.
"
"When it appears to you where this begins,
[p]Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
[p]Can never be so equal, that your love
[p]Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
[p]Choose your own company, and command what cost
[p]Your heart has mind to.
"
"How now, friend Eros!
"
"There's strange news come, sir.
"
"What, man?
"
"Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
"
"This is old: what is the success?
"
"Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
[p]Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
[p]him partake in the glory of the action: and not
[p]resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
[p]wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
[p]the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
"
"Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
[p]And throw between them all the food thou hast,
[p]They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
"
"He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
[p]The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
[p]And threats the throat of that his officer
[p]That murder'd Pompey.
"
"Our great navy's rigg'd.
"
"For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
[p]My lord desires you presently: my news
[p]I might have told hereafter.
"
"'Twill be naught:
[p]But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
"
"Come, sir.
"
"Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,
[p]In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:
[p]I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
[p]Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
[p]Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
[p]Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
[p]And all the unlawful issue that their lust
[p]Since then hath made between them. Unto her
[p]He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
[p]Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
[p]Absolute queen.
"
"This in the public eye?
"
"I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
[p]His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
[p]Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
[p]He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
[p]Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she
[p]In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
[p]That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
[p]As 'tis reported, so.
"
"Let Rome be thus Inform'd.
"
"Who, queasy with his insolence
[p]Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
"
"The people know it; and have now received
[p]His accusations.
"
"Who does he accuse?
"
"Caesar: and that, having in Sicily
[p]Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
[p]His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me
[p]Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
[p]That Lepidus of the triumvirate
[p]Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain
[p]All his revenue.
"
"Sir, this should be answer'd.
"
"'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
[p]I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
[p]That he his high authority abused,
[p]And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
[p]I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
[p]And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
[p]Demand the like.
"
"He'll never yield to that.
"
"Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
"
"Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
"
"That ever I should call thee castaway!
"
"You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
"
"Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
[p]Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
[p]Should have an army for an usher, and
[p]The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
[p]Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
[p]Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
[p]Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
[p]Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
[p]Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
[p]A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
[p]The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
[p]Is often left unloved; we should have met you
[p]By sea and land; supplying every stage
[p]With an augmented greeting.
"
"Good my lord,
[p]To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
[p]On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
[p]Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
[p]My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
[p]His pardon for return.
"
"Which soon he granted,
[p]Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
"
"Do not say so, my lord.
"
"I have eyes upon him,
[p]And his affairs come to me on the wind.
[p]Where is he now?
"
"My lord, in Athens.
"
"No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra
[p]Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
[p]Up to a whore; who now are levying
[p]The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled
[p]Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,
[p]Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
[p]Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
[p]King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
[p]Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
[p]Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
[p]The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
[p]With a more larger list of sceptres.
"
"Ay me, most wretched,
[p]That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
[p]That do afflict each other!
"
"Welcome hither:
[p]Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;
[p]Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,
[p]And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
[p]Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
[p]O'er your content these strong necessities;
[p]But let determined things to destiny
[p]Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
[p]Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
[p]Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,
[p]To do you justice, make them ministers
[p]Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;
[p]And ever welcome to us.
"
"Welcome, lady.
"
"Welcome, dear madam.
[p]Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
[p]Only the adulterous Antony, most large
[p]In his abominations, turns you off;
[p]And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
[p]That noises it against us.
"
"Is it so, sir?
"
"Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,
[p]Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!
"
"I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
"
"But why, why, why?
"
"Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
[p]And say'st it is not fit.
"
"Well, is it, is it?
"
"If not denounced against us, why should not we
[p]Be there in person?
"
"[Aside] Well, I could reply:
[p]If we should serve with horse and mares together,
[p]The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
[p]A soldier and his horse.
"
"What is't you say?
"
"Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
[p]Take from his heart, take from his brain,
[p]from's time,
[p]What should not then be spared. He is already
[p]Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
[p]That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
[p]Manage this war.
"
"Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
[p]That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
[p]And, as the president of my kingdom, will
[p]Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
[p]I will not stay behind.
"
"Nay, I have done.
[p]Here comes the emperor.
"
"Is it not strange, Canidius,
[p]That from Tarentum and Brundusium
[p]He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
[p]And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?
"
"Celerity is never more admired
[p]Than by the negligent.
"
"A good rebuke,
[p]Which might have well becomed the best of men,
[p]To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
[p]Will fight with him by sea.
"
"By sea! what else?
"
"Why will my lord do so?
"
"For that he dares us to't.
"
"So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
"
"Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
[p]Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
[p]Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;
[p]And so should you.
"
"Your ships are not well mann'd;
[p]Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
[p]Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
[p]Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
[p]Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace
[p]Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
[p]Being prepared for land.
"
"By sea, by sea.
"
"Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
[p]The absolute soldiership you have by land;
[p]Distract your army, which doth most consist
[p]Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
[p]Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
[p]The way which promises assurance; and
[p]Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
[p]From firm security.
"
"I'll fight at sea.
"
"I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
"
"Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
[p]And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
[p]Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
[p]We then can do't at land.
[p][Enter a Messenger]
[p]Thy business?
"
"The news is true, my lord; he is descried;
[p]Caesar has taken Toryne.
"
"Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
[p]Strange that power should be. Canidius,
[p]Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
[p]And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:
[p]Away, my Thetis!
[p][Enter a Soldier]
[p]How now, worthy soldier?
"
"O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;
[p]Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
[p]This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
[p]And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
[p]Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
[p]And fighting foot to foot.
"
"Well, well: away!
"
"By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.
"
"Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
[p]Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
[p]And we are women's men.
"
"You keep by land
[p]The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
"
"Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
[p]Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:
[p]But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
[p]Carries beyond belief.
"
"While he was yet in Rome,
[p]His power went out in such distractions as
[p]Beguiled all spies.
"
"Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
"
"They say, one Taurus.
"
"Well I know the man.
"
"The emperor calls Canidius.
"
"With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,
[p]Each minute, some.
"
"Taurus!
"
"My lord?
"
"Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,
[p]Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
[p]The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies
[p]Upon this jump.
"
"Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,
[p]In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
[p]We may the number of the ships behold,
[p]And so proceed accordingly.
"
"Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:
[p]The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
[p]With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
[p]To see't mine eyes are blasted.
"
"Gods and goddesses,
[p]All the whole synod of them!
"
"What's thy passion!
"
"The greater cantle of the world is lost
[p]With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
[p]Kingdoms and provinces.
"
"How appears the fight?
"
"On our side like the token'd pestilence,
[p]Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
[p]Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
[p]When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
[p]Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
[p]The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
[p]Hoists sails and flies.
"
"That I beheld:
[p]Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
[p]Endure a further view.
"
"She once being loof'd,
[p]The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
[p]Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
[p]Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
[p]I never saw an action of such shame;
[p]Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
[p]Did violate so itself.
"
"Alack, alack!
"
"Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
[p]And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
[p]Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
[p]O, he has given example for our flight,
[p]Most grossly, by his own!
"
"Ay, are you thereabouts?
[p]Why, then, good night indeed.
"
"Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
"
"'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
[p]What further comes.
"
"To Caesar will I render
[p]My legions and my horse: six kings already
[p]Show me the way of yielding.
"
"I'll yet follow
[p]The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
[p]Sits in the wind against me.
"
"Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
[p]It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:
[p]I am so lated in the world, that I
[p]Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
[p]Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,
[p]And make your peace with Caesar.
"
"Fly! not we.
"
"I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards
[p]To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
[p]I have myself resolved upon a course
[p]Which has no need of you; be gone:
[p]My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
[p]I follow'd that I blush to look upon:
[p]My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
[p]Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
[p]For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
[p]Have letters from me to some friends that will
[p]Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
[p]Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
[p]Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
[p]Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
[p]I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
[p]Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
[p]Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,
[p]Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.

"
"Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.
"
"Do, most dear queen.
"
"Do! why: what else?
"
"Let me sit down. O Juno!
"
"No, no, no, no, no.
"
"See you here, sir?
"
"O fie, fie, fie!
"
"Madam!
"
"Madam, O good empress!
"
"Sir, sir,--
"
"Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
[p]His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck
[p]The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
[p]That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
[p]Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had
[p]In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.
"
"Ah, stand by.
"
"The queen, my lord, the queen.
"
"Go to him, madam, speak to him:
[p]He is unqualitied with very shame.
"
"Well then, sustain him: O!
"
"Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
[p]Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
[p]Your comfort makes the rescue.
"
"I have offended reputation,
[p]A most unnoble swerving.
"
"Sir, the queen.
"
"O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,
[p]How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
[p]By looking back what I have left behind
[p]'Stroy'd in dishonour.
"
"O my lord, my lord,
[p]Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
[p]You would have follow'd.
"
"Egypt, thou knew'st too well
[p]My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,
[p]And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit
[p]Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
[p]Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
[p]Command me.
"
"O, my pardon!
"
"Now I must
[p]To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
[p]And palter in the shifts of lowness; who
[p]With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
[p]Making and marring fortunes. You did know
[p]How much you were my conqueror; and that
[p]My sword, made weak by my affection, would
[p]Obey it on all cause.
"
"Pardon, pardon!
"
"Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
[p]All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
[p]Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;
[p]Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
[p]Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
[p]We scorn her most when most she offers blows.
"
"Let him appear that's come from Antony.
[p]Know you him?
"
"Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
[p]An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
[p]He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
[p]Which had superfluous kings for messengers
[p]Not many moons gone by.
"
"Approach, and speak.
"
"Such as I am, I come from Antony:
[p]I was of late as petty to his ends
[p]As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
[p]To his grand sea.
"
"Be't so: declare thine office.
"
"Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
[p]Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
[p]He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
[p]To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
[p]A private man in Athens: this for him.
[p]Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;
[p]Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
[p]The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
[p]Now hazarded to thy grace.
"
"For Antony,
[p]I have no ears to his request. The queen
[p]Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
[p]From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
[p]Or take his life there: this if she perform,
[p]She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
"
"Fortune pursue thee!
"
"Bring him through the bands.
[p][Exit EUPHRONIUS]
[p][To THYREUS] To try eloquence, now 'tis time: dispatch;]
[p]From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,
[p]And in our name, what she requires; add more,
[p]From thine invention, offers: women are not
[p]In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
[p]The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;
[p]Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
[p]Will answer as a law.
"
"Caesar, I go.
"
"Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
[p]And what thou think'st his very action speaks
[p]In every power that moves.
"
"Caesar, I shall.
"
"What shall we do, Enobarbus?
"
"Think, and die.
"
"Is Antony or we in fault for this?
"
"Antony only, that would make his will
[p]Lord of his reason. What though you fled
[p]From that great face of war, whose several ranges
[p]Frighted each other? why should he follow?
[p]The itch of his affection should not then
[p]Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
[p]When half to half the world opposed, he being
[p]The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
[p]Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
[p]And leave his navy gazing.
"
"Prithee, peace.
"
"Is that his answer?
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
[p]Will yield us up.
"
"He says so.
"
"Let her know't.
[p]To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
[p]And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
[p]With principalities.
"
"That head, my lord?
"
"To him again: tell him he wears the rose
[p]Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
[p]Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,
[p]May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail
[p]Under the service of a child as soon
[p]As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
[p]To lay his gay comparisons apart,
[p]And answer me declined, sword against sword,
[p]Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.
"
"[Aside] Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
[p]Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,
[p]Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
[p]A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
[p]Do draw the inward quality after them,
[p]To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
[p]Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
[p]Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued
[p]His judgment too.
"
"A messenger from CAESAR.
"
"What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
[p]Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
[p]That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.
"
"[Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
[p]The loyalty well held to fools does make
[p]Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure
[p]To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
[p]Does conquer him that did his master conquer
[p]And earns a place i' the story.
"
"Caesar's will?
"
"Hear it apart.
"
"None but friends: say boldly.
"
"So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
"
"He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
[p]Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
[p]Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
[p]Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.
"
"So.
[p]Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,
[p]Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
[p]Further than he is Caesar.
"
"Go on: right royal.
"
"He knows that you embrace not Antony
[p]As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
"
"O!
"
"The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
[p]Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
[p]Not as deserved.
"
"He is a god, and knows
[p]What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
[p]But conquer'd merely.
"
"[Aside] To be sure of that,
[p]I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,
[p]That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
[p]Thy dearest quit thee.
"
"Shall I say to Caesar
[p]What you require of him? for he partly begs
[p]To be desired to give. It much would please him,
[p]That of his fortunes you should make a staff
[p]To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,
[p]To hear from me you had left Antony,
[p]And put yourself under his shrowd,
[p]The universal landlord.
"
"What's your name?
"
"My name is Thyreus.
"
"Most kind messenger,
[p]Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
[p]I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt
[p]To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:
[p]Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
[p]The doom of Egypt.
"
"'Tis your noblest course.
[p]Wisdom and fortune combating together,
[p]If that the former dare but what it can,
[p]No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
[p]My duty on your hand.
"
"Your Caesar's father oft,
[p]When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
[p]Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
[p]As it rain'd kisses.
"
"Favours, by Jove that thunders!
[p]What art thou, fellow?
"
"One that but performs
[p]The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
[p]To have command obey'd.
"
"[Aside] You will be whipp'd.
"
"Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods
[p]and devils!
[p]Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
[p]Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
[p]And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
[p]Antony yet.
[p][Enter Attendants]
[p]Take hence this Jack, and whip him.
"
"[Aside] 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
[p]Than with an old one dying.
"
"Moon and stars!
[p]Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
[p]That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
[p]So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,
[p]Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
[p]Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,
[p]And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.
"
"Mark Antony!
"
"Tug him away: being whipp'd,
[p]Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall
[p]Bear us an errand to him.
[p][Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS]
[p]You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
[p]Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
[p]Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
[p]And by a gem of women, to be abused
[p]By one that looks on feeders?
"
"Good my lord,--
"
"You have been a boggler ever:
[p]But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
[p]O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;
[p]In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
[p]Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut
[p]To our confusion.
"
"O, is't come to this?
"
"I found you as a morsel cold upon
[p]Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
[p]Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
[p]Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
[p]Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,
[p]Though you can guess what temperance should be,
[p]You know not what it is.
"
"Wherefore is this?
"
"To let a fellow that will take rewards
[p]And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
[p]My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
[p]And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
[p]Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
[p]The horned herd! for I have savage cause;
[p]And to proclaim it civilly, were like
[p]A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
[p]For being yare about him.
[p][Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS]
[p]Is he whipp'd?
"
"Soundly, my lord.
"
"Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
"
"He did ask favour.
"
"If that thy father live, let him repent
[p]Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
[p]To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
[p]Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
[p]The white hand of a lady fever thee,
[p]Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,
[p]Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say
[p]He makes me angry with him; for he seems
[p]Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
[p]Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
[p]And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
[p]When my good stars, that were my former guides,
[p]Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
[p]Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
[p]My speech and what is done, tell him he has
[p]Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
[p]He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
[p]As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:
[p]Hence with thy stripes, begone!
"
"Have you done yet?
"
"Alack, our terrene moon
[p]Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone
[p]The fall of Antony!
"
"I must stay his time.
"
"To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
[p]With one that ties his points?
"
"Not know me yet?
"
"Cold-hearted toward me?
"
"Ah, dear, if I be so,
[p]From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
[p]And poison it in the source; and the first stone
[p]Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
[p]Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
[p]Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
[p]Together with my brave Egyptians all,
[p]By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
[p]Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
[p]Have buried them for prey!
"
"I am satisfied.
[p]Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where
[p]I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
[p]Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
[p]Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.
[p]Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
[p]If from the field I shall return once more
[p]To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
[p]I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
[p]There's hope in't yet.
"
"That's my brave lord!
"
"I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,
[p]And fight maliciously: for when mine hours
[p]Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
[p]Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
[p]And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
[p]Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
[p]All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
[p]Let's mock the midnight bell.
"
"It is my birth-day:
[p]I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord
[p]Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
"
"We will yet do well.
"
"Call all his noble captains to my lord.
"
"Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
[p]The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
[p]There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,
[p]I'll make death love me; for I will contend
[p]Even with his pestilent scythe.
"
"Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,
[p]Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood
[p]The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
[p]A diminution in our captain's brain
[p]Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,
[p]It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
[p]Some way to leave him.
"
"He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
[p]To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
[p]He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
[p]Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
[p]I have many other ways to die; meantime
[p]Laugh at his challenge.
"
"Caesar must think,
[p]When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
[p]Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
[p]Make boot of his distraction: never anger
[p]Made good guard for itself.
"
"Let our best heads
[p]Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles
[p]We mean to fight: within our files there are,
[p]Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
[p]Enough to fetch him in. See it done:
[p]And feast the army; we have store to do't,
[p]And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!
"
"He will not fight with me, Domitius.
"
"No.
"
"Why should he not?
"
"He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
[p]He is twenty men to one.
"
"To-morrow, soldier,
[p]By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
[p]Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
[p]Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
"
"I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
"
"Well said; come on.
[p]Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
[p]Be bounteous at our meal.
[p][Enter three or four Servitors]
[p]Give me thy hand,
[p]Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--
[p]Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,
[p]And kings have been your fellows.
"
"[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What means this?
"
"[Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd
[p]tricks which sorrow shoots
[p]Out of the mind.
"
"And thou art honest too.
[p]I wish I could be made so many men,
[p]And all of you clapp'd up together in
[p]An Antony, that I might do you service
[p]So good as you have done.
"
"The gods forbid!
"
"Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:
[p]Scant not my cups; and make as much of me
[p]As when mine empire was your fellow too,
[p]And suffer'd my command.
"
"[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?
"
"[Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.
"
"Tend me to-night;
[p]May be it is the period of your duty:
[p]Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
[p]A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
[p]You'll serve another master. I look on you
[p]As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
[p]I turn you not away; but, like a master
[p]Married to your good service, stay till death:
[p]Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
[p]And the gods yield you for't!
"
"What mean you, sir,
[p]To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
[p]And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
[p]Transform us not to women.
"
"Ho, ho, ho!
[p]Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
[p]Grace grow where those drops fall!
[p]My hearty friends,
[p]You take me in too dolorous a sense;
[p]For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
[p]To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
[p]I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
[p]Where rather I'll expect victorious life
[p]Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
[p]And drown consideration.
"
"Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.
"
"It will determine one way: fare you well.
[p]Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
"
"Nothing. What news?
"
"Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
"
"Well, sir, good night.
"
"Soldiers, have careful watch.
"
"And you. Good night, good night.
"
"Here we: and if to-morrow
[p]Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
[p]Our landmen will stand up.
"
"'Tis a brave army,
[p]And full of purpose.
"
"Peace! what noise?
"
"List, list!
"
"Hark!
"
"Music i' the air.
"
"Under the earth.
"
"It signs well, does it not?
"
"No.
"
"Peace, I say!
[p]What should this mean?
"
"'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
[p]Now leaves him.
"
"Walk; let's see if other watchmen
[p]Do hear what we do?
"
"How now, masters!
"
"[Speaking together] How now!
[p]How now! do you hear this?
"
"Ay; is't not strange?
"
"Do you hear, masters? do you hear?
"
"Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
[p]Let's see how it will give off.
"
"Content. 'Tis strange.
"
"Eros! mine armour, Eros!
"
"Sleep a little.
"
"No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!
[p][Enter EROS with armour]
[p]Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
[p]If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
[p]Because we brave her: come.
"
"Nay, I'll help too.
[p]What's this for?
"
"Ah, let be, let be! thou art
[p]The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.
"
"Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.
"
"Well, well;
[p]We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
[p]Go put on thy defences.
"
"Briefly, sir.
"
"Is not this buckled well?
"
"Rarely, rarely:
[p]He that unbuckles this, till we do please
[p]To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
[p]Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
[p]More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,
[p]That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
[p]The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
[p]A workman in't.
[p][Enter an armed Soldier]
[p]Good morrow to thee; welcome:
[p]Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
[p]To business that we love we rise betime,
[p]And go to't with delight.
"
"A thousand, sir,
[p]Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
[p]And at the port expect you.
"
"The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.
"
"Good morrow, general.
"
"'Tis well blown, lads:
[p]This morning, like the spirit of a youth
[p]That means to be of note, begins betimes.
[p]So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
[p]Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:
[p]This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable
[p][Kisses her]
[p]And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
[p]On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
[p]Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
[p]Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.
"
"Please you, retire to your chamber.
"
"Lead me.
[p]He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
[p]Determine this great war in single fight!
[p]Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.
"
"The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
"
"Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
[p]To make me fight at land!
"
"Hadst thou done so,
[p]The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
[p]That has this morning left thee, would have still
[p]Follow'd thy heels.
"
"Who's gone this morning?
"
"Who!
[p]One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
[p]He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
[p]Say 'I am none of thine.'
"
"What say'st thou?
"
"Sir,
[p]He is with Caesar.
"
"Sir, his chests and treasure
[p]He has not with him.
"
"Is he gone?
"
"Most certain.
"
"Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
[p]Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
[p]I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
[p]Say that I wish he never find more cause
[p]To change a master. O, my fortunes have
[p]Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!
"
"Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:
[p]Our will is Antony be took alive;
[p]Make it so known.
"
"Caesar, I shall.
"
"The time of universal peace is near:
[p]Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
[p]Shall bear the olive freely.
"
"Antony
[p]Is come into the field.
"
"Go charge Agrippa
[p]Plant those that have revolted in the van,
[p]That Antony may seem to spend his fury
[p]Upon himself.
"
"Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on
[p]Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
[p]Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
[p]And leave his master Antony: for this pains
[p]Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
[p]That fell away have entertainment, but
[p]No honourable trust. I have done ill;
[p]Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
[p]That I will joy no more.
"
"Enobarbus, Antony
[p]Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
[p]His bounty overplus: the messenger
[p]Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
[p]Unloading of his mules.
"
"I give it you.
"
"Mock not, Enobarbus.
[p]I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
[p]Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
[p]Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
[p]Continues still a Jove.
"
"I am alone the villain of the earth,
[p]And feel I am so most. O Antony,
[p]Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
[p]My better service, when my turpitude
[p]Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
[p]If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
[p]Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
[p]I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
[p]Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
[p]My latter part of life.
"
"Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:
[p]Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
[p]Exceeds what we expected.
"
"O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
[p]Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
[p]With clouts about their heads.
"
"Thou bleed'st apace.
"
"I had a wound here that was like a T,
[p]But now 'tis made an H.
"
"They do retire.
"
"We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
[p]Room for six scotches more.
"
"They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
[p]For a fair victory.
"
"Let us score their backs,
[p]And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
[p]'Tis sport to maul a runner.
"
"I will reward thee
[p]Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold
[p]For thy good valour. Come thee on.
"
"I'll halt after.
"
"We have beat him to his camp: run one before,
[p]And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
[p]Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
[p]That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
[p]For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
[p]Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been
[p]Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
[p]Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
[p]Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
[p]Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
[p]The honour'd gashes whole.
[p][To SCARUS]
[p]Give me thy hand
[p][Enter CLEOPATRA, attended]
[p]To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
[p]Make her thanks bless thee.
[p][To CLEOPATRA]
[p]O thou day o' the world,
[p]Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,
[p]Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
[p]Ride on the pants triumphing!
"
"Lord of lords!
[p]O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
[p]The world's great snare uncaught?
"
"My nightingale,
[p]We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!
[p]though grey
[p]Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
[p]A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
[p]Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
[p]Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
[p]Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
[p]As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
[p]Destroy'd in such a shape.
"
"I'll give thee, friend,
[p]An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
"
"He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
[p]Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
[p]Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
[p]Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
[p]Had our great palace the capacity
[p]To camp this host, we all would sup together,
[p]And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
[p]Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
[p]With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
[p]Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
[p]That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
[p]Applauding our approach.
"
"If we be not relieved within this hour,
[p]We must return to the court of guard: the night
[p]Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
[p]By the second hour i' the morn.
"
"This last day was
[p]A shrewd one to's.
"
"O, bear me witness, night,--
"
"What man is this?
"
"Stand close, and list him.
"
"Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
[p]When men revolted shall upon record
[p]Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
[p]Before thy face repent!
"
"Enobarbus!
"
"Peace!
[p]Hark further.
"
"O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
[p]The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
[p]That life, a very rebel to my will,
[p]May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
[p]Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
[p]Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
[p]And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
[p]Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
[p]Forgive me in thine own particular;
[p]But let the world rank me in register
[p]A master-leaver and a fugitive:
[p]O Antony! O Antony!
"
"Let's speak To him.
"
"Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
[p]May concern Caesar.
"
"Let's do so. But he sleeps.
"
"Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
[p]Was never yet for sleep.
"
"Go we to him.
"
"Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
"
"Hear you, sir?
"
"The hand of death hath raught him.
[p][Drums afar off]
[p]Hark! the drums
[p]Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
[p]To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
[p]Is fully out.
"
"Come on, then;
[p]He may recover yet.
"
"Their preparation is to-day by sea;
[p]We please them not by land.
"
"For both, my lord.
"
"I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;
[p]We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot
[p]Upon the hills adjoining to the city
[p]Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;
[p]They have put forth the haven [--]
[p]Where their appointment we may best discover,
[p]And look on their endeavour.
"
"But being charged, we will be still by land,
[p]Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
[p]Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
[p]And hold our best advantage.
"
"Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine
[p]does stand,
[p]I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word
[p]Straight, how 'tis like to go.
"
"Swallows have built
[p]In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
[p]Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
[p]And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
[p]Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
[p]His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,
[p]Of what he has, and has not.
"
"All is lost;
[p]This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:
[p]My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder
[p]They cast their caps up and carouse together
[p]Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
[p]'tis thou
[p]Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
[p]Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
[p]For when I am revenged upon my charm,
[p]I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.
[p][Exit SCARUS]
[p]O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:
[p]Fortune and Antony part here; even here
[p]Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
[p]That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
[p]Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
[p]On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,
[p]That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
[p]O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--
[p]Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;
[p]Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
[p]Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
[p]Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
[p]What, Eros, Eros!
[p][Enter CLEOPATRA]
[p]Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!
"
"Why is my lord enraged against his love?
"
"Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,
[p]And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,
[p]And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:
[p]Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
[p]Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
[p]For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
[p]Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
[p]With her prepared nails.
[p][Exit CLEOPATRA]
[p]'Tis well thou'rt gone,
[p]If it be well to live; but better 'twere
[p]Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
[p]Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
[p]The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,
[p]Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:
[p]Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
[p]And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
[p]Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:
[p]To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
[p]Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!
"
"Help me, my women! O, he is more mad
[p]Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
[p]Was never so emboss'd.
"
"To the monument!
[p]There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
[p]The soul and body rive not more in parting
[p]Than greatness going off.
"
"To the monument!
[p]Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
[p]Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
[p]And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,
[p]And bring me how he takes my death.
[p]To the monument!
"
"Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
"
"Ay, noble lord.
"
"Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
[p]A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
[p]A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
[p]A forked mountain, or blue promontory
[p]With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,
[p]And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen
[p]these signs;
[p]They are black vesper's pageants.
"
"Ay, my lord,
"
"That which is now a horse, even with a thought
[p]The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
[p]As water is in water.
"
"It does, my lord.
"
"My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
[p]Even such a body: here I am Antony:
[p]Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
[p]I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--
[p]Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;
[p]Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
[p]A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
[p]Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
[p]Unto an enemy's triumph.
[p]Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
[p]Ourselves to end ourselves.
[p][Enter MARDIAN]
[p]O! thy vile lady!
[p]She has robb'd me of my sword.
"
"No, Antony;
[p]My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
[p]With thine entirely.
"
"Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
[p]She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
"
"Death of one person can be paid but once,
[p]And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
[p]Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
[p]Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
[p]Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
[p]The name of Antony; it was divided
[p]Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
[p]Thy name so buried in her.
"
"Dead, then?
"
"Dead.
"
"Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
[p]And we must sleep.
[p][To MARDIAN]
[p]That thou depart'st hence safe,
[p]Does pay thy labour richly; go.
[p][Exit MARDIAN]
[p]Off, pluck off:
[p]The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
[p]The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
[p]Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
[p]Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
[p]No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;
[p]You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
[p][Exit EROS]
[p]I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
[p]Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
[p]All length is torture: since the torch is out,
[p]Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour
[p]Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
[p]Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.
[p]Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:
[p]Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
[p]And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:
[p]Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,
[p]And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!
"
"What would my lord?
"
"Since Cleopatra died,
[p]I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods
[p]Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
[p]Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
[p]With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
[p]The courage of a woman; less noble mind
[p]Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
[p]'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
[p]That, when the exigent should come, which now
[p]Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
[p]The inevitable prosecution of
[p]Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
[p]Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:
[p]Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
[p]Put colour in thy cheek.
"
"The gods withhold me!
[p]Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
[p]Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?
"
"Eros,
[p]Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
[p]Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
[p]His corrigible neck, his face subdued
[p]To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
[p]Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
[p]His baseness that ensued?
"
"I would not see't.
"
"Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
[p]Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
[p]Most useful for thy country.
"
"O, sir, pardon me!
"
"When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
[p]To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;
[p]Or thy precedent services are all
[p]But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.
"
"Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
[p]Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
"
"Lo thee!
"
"My sword is drawn.
"
"Then let it do at once
[p]The thing why thou hast drawn it.
"
"My dear master,
[p]My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
[p]Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
"
"'Tis said, man; and farewell.
"
"Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
"
"Now, Eros.
"
"Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow
[p]Of Antony's death.
"
"Thrice-nobler than myself!
[p]Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
[p]I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
[p]Have by their brave instruction got upon me
[p]A nobleness in record: but I will be
[p]A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
[p]As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
[p]Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus
[p][Falling on his sword]
[p]I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
[p]The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
"
"What's the noise?
"
"I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end
[p]Of what I have begun.
"
"The star is fall'n.
"
"And time is at his period.
"
"Alas, and woe!
"
"Let him that loves me strike me dead.
"
"Not I.
"
"Nor I.
"
"Nor any one.
"
"Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
[p]This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
[p]Shall enter me with him.
"
"Where's Antony?
"
"There, Diomed there.
"
"Lives he?
[p]Wilt thou not answer, man?
"
"Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
[p]Sufficing strokes for death.
"
"Most absolute lord,
[p]My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
"
"When did she send thee?
"
"Now, my lord.
"
"Where is she?
"
"Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
[p]Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
[p]Which never shall be found--you did suspect
[p]She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
[p]Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;
[p]But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
[p]Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
[p]I dread, too late.
"
"Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.
"
"What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!
[p]Come, your lord calls!
"
"Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
[p]'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
"
"Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
[p]All your true followers out.
"
"Most heavy day!
"
"Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
[p]To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome
[p]Which comes to punish us, and we punish it
[p]Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:
[p]I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,
[p]And have my thanks for all.
"
"O Charmian, I will never go from hence.
"
"Be comforted, dear madam.
"
"No, I will not:
[p]All strange and terrible events are welcome,
[p]But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
[p]Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
[p]As that which makes it.
[p][Enter, below, DIOMEDES]
[p]How now! is he dead?
"
"His death's upon him, but not dead.
[p]Look out o' the other side your monument;
[p]His guard have brought him thither.
"
"O sun,
[p]Burn the great sphere thou movest in!
[p]darkling stand
[p]The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,
[p]Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
[p]Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.
"
"Peace!
[p]Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
[p]But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.
"
"So it should be, that none but Antony
[p]Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
"
"I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
[p]I here importune death awhile, until
[p]Of many thousand kisses the poor last
[p]I lay up thy lips.
"
"I dare not, dear,--
[p]Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,
[p]Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
[p]Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
[p]Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,
[p]serpents, have
[p]Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
[p]Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
[p]And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
[p]Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--
[p]Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:
[p]Assist, good friends.
"
"O, quick, or I am gone.
"
"Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
[p]Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
[p]That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,
[p]The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
[p]And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--
[p]Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;
[p][They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA]
[p]And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
[p]Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,
[p]Thus would I wear them out.
"
"A heavy sight!
"
"I am dying, Egypt, dying:
[p]Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.
"
"No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
[p]That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
[p]Provoked by my offence.
"
"One word, sweet queen:
[p]Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!
"
"They do not go together.
"
"Gentle, hear me:
[p]None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
"
"My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
[p]None about Caesar.
"
"The miserable change now at my end
[p]Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
[p]In feeding them with those my former fortunes
[p]Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,
[p]The noblest; and do now not basely die,
[p]Not cowardly put off my helmet to
[p]My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman
[p]Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
[p]I can no more.
"
"Noblest of men, woo't die?
[p]Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
[p]In this dull world, which in thy absence is
[p]No better than a sty? O, see, my women,
[p][MARK ANTONY dies]
[p]The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
[p]O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
[p]The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
[p]Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
[p]And there is nothing left remarkable
[p]Beneath the visiting moon.
"
"O, quietness, lady!
"
"She is dead too, our sovereign.
"
"Lady!
"
"Madam!
"
"O madam, madam, madam!
"
"Royal Egypt, Empress!
"
"Peace, peace, Iras!
"
"No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
[p]By such poor passion as the maid that milks
[p]And does the meanest chares. It were for me
[p]To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
[p]To tell them that this world did equal theirs
[p]Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
[p]Patience is scottish, and impatience does
[p]Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
[p]To rush into the secret house of death,
[p]Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
[p]What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
[p]My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
[p]Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:
[p]We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,
[p]what's noble,
[p]Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
[p]And make death proud to take us. Come, away:
[p]This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
[p]Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend
[p]But resolution, and the briefest end.
"
"Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
[p]Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
[p]The pauses that he makes.
"
"Caesar, I shall.
"
"Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
[p]Appear thus to us?
"
"I am call'd Dercetas;
[p]Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
[p]Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,
[p]He was my master; and I wore my life
[p]To spend upon his haters. If thou please
[p]To take me to thee, as I was to him
[p]I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
[p]I yield thee up my life.
"
"What is't thou say'st?
"
"I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
"
"The breaking of so great a thing should make
[p]A greater crack: the round world
[p]Should have shook lions into civil streets,
[p]And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
[p]Is not a single doom; in the name lay
[p]A moiety of the world.
"
"He is dead, Caesar:
[p]Not by a public minister of justice,
[p]Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
[p]Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
[p]Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
[p]Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
[p]I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
[p]With his most noble blood.
"
"Look you sad, friends?
[p]The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
[p]To wash the eyes of kings.
"
"And strange it is,
[p]That nature must compel us to lament
[p]Our most persisted deeds.
"
"His taints and honours
[p]Waged equal with him.
"
"A rarer spirit never
[p]Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us
[p]Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
"
"When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
[p]He needs must see himself.
"
"O Antony!
[p]I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance
[p]Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
[p]Have shown to thee such a declining day,
[p]Or look on thine; we could not stall together
[p]In the whole world: but yet let me lament,
[p]With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
[p]That thou, my brother, my competitor
[p]In top of all design, my mate in empire,
[p]Friend and companion in the front of war,
[p]The arm of mine own body, and the heart
[p]Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,
[p]Unreconciliable, should divide
[p]Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--
[p]But I will tell you at some meeter season:
[p][Enter an Egyptian]
[p]The business of this man looks out of him;
[p]We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
"
"A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
[p]Confined in all she has, her monument,
[p]Of thy intents desires instruction,
[p]That she preparedly may frame herself
[p]To the way she's forced to.
"
"Bid her have good heart:
[p]She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
[p]How honourable and how kindly we
[p]Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live
[p]To be ungentle.
"
"So the gods preserve thee!
"
"Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,
[p]We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
[p]The quality of her passion shall require,
[p]Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
[p]She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
[p]Would be eternal in our triumph: go,
[p]And with your speediest bring us what she says,
[p]And how you find of her.
"
"Caesar, I shall.
"
"Gallus, go you along.
[p][Exit GALLUS]
[p]Where's Dolabella,
[p]To second Proculeius?
"
"Dolabella!
"
"Let him alone, for I remember now
[p]How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.
[p]Go with me to my tent; where you shall see
[p]How hardly I was drawn into this war;
[p]How calm and gentle I proceeded still
[p]In all my writings: go with me, and see
[p]What I can show in this.
"
"My desolation does begin to make
[p]A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
[p]Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
[p]A minister of her will: and it is great
[p]To do that thing that ends all other deeds;
[p]Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
[p]Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
[p]The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
[p][Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS,]
[p]GALLUS and Soldiers]
"
"Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;
[p]And bids thee study on what fair demands
[p]Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
"
"What's thy name?
"
"My name is Proculeius.
"
"Antony
[p]Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
[p]I do not greatly care to be deceived,
[p]That have no use for trusting. If your master
[p]Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
[p]That majesty, to keep decorum, must
[p]No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
[p]To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
[p]He gives me so much of mine own, as I
[p]Will kneel to him with thanks.
"
"Be of good cheer;
[p]You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:
[p]Make your full reference freely to my lord,
[p]Who is so full of grace, that it flows over
[p]On all that need: let me report to him
[p]Your sweet dependency; and you shall find
[p]A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,
[p]Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
"
"Pray you, tell him
[p]I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
[p]The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
[p]A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly
[p]Look him i' the face.
"
"This I'll report, dear lady.
[p]Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
[p]Of him that caused it.
"
"You see how easily she may be surprised:
[p][Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the]
[p]monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,
[p]having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of
[p]the Guard unbar and open the gates]
[p][To PROCULEIUS and the Guard]
[p]Guard her till Caesar come.
"
"Royal queen!
"
"O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
"
"Quick, quick, good hands.
"
"Hold, worthy lady, hold:
[p][Seizes and disarms her]
[p]Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
[p]Relieved, but not betray'd.
"
"What, of death too,
[p]That rids our dogs of languish?
"
"Cleopatra,
[p]Do not abuse my master's bounty by
[p]The undoing of yourself: let the world see
[p]His nobleness well acted, which your death
[p]Will never let come forth.
"
"Where art thou, death?
[p]Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
[p]Worthy many babes and beggars!
"
"O, temperance, lady!
"
"Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
[p]If idle talk will once be necessary,
[p]I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,
[p]Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
[p]Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;
[p]Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
[p]Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
[p]And show me to the shouting varletry
[p]Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
[p]Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
[p]Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies
[p]Blow me into abhorring! rather make
[p]My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
[p]And hang me up in chains!
"
"You do extend
[p]These thoughts of horror further than you shall
[p]Find cause in Caesar.
"
"Proculeius,
[p]What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
[p]And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,
[p]I'll take her to my guard.
"
"So, Dolabella,
[p]It shall content me best: be gentle to her.
[p][To CLEOPATRA]
[p]To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
[p]If you'll employ me to him.
"
"Say, I would die.
"
"Most noble empress, you have heard of me?
"
"I cannot tell.
"
"Assuredly you know me.
"
"No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
[p]You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
[p]Is't not your trick?
"
"I understand not, madam.
"
"I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
[p]O, such another sleep, that I might see
[p]But such another man!
"
"If it might please ye,--
"
"His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
[p]A sun and moon, which kept their course,
[p]and lighted
[p]The little O, the earth.
"
"Most sovereign creature,--
"
"His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
[p]Crested the world: his voice was propertied
[p]As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
[p]But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
[p]He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
[p]There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
[p]That grew the more by reaping: his delights
[p]Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
[p]The element they lived in: in his livery
[p]Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
[p]As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
"
"Cleopatra!
"
"Think you there was, or might be, such a man
[p]As this I dream'd of?
"
"Gentle madam, no.
"
"You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
[p]But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
[p]It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
[p]To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine
[p]And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
[p]Condemning shadows quite.
"
"Hear me, good madam.
[p]Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
[p]As answering to the weight: would I might never
[p]O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,
[p]By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
[p]My very heart at root.
"
"I thank you, sir,
[p]Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
"
"I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
"
"Nay, pray you, sir,--
"
"Though he be honourable,--
"
"He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
"
"Madam, he will; I know't.
[p][Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there:]
[p]Octavius Caesar!']
[p][Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS,]
[p]MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train]
"
"Which is the Queen of Egypt?
"
"It is the emperor, madam.
"
"Arise, you shall not kneel:
[p]I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
"
"Sir, the gods
[p]Will have it thus; my master and my lord
[p]I must obey.
"
"Take to you no hard thoughts:
[p]The record of what injuries you did us,
[p]Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
[p]As things but done by chance.
"
"Sole sir o' the world,
[p]I cannot project mine own cause so well
[p]To make it clear; but do confess I have
[p]Been laden with like frailties which before
[p]Have often shamed our sex.
"
"Cleopatra, know,
[p]We will extenuate rather than enforce:
[p]If you apply yourself to our intents,
[p]Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
[p]A benefit in this change; but if you seek
[p]To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
[p]Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
[p]Of my good purposes, and put your children
[p]To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
[p]If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
"
"And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,
[p]Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
[p]Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
"
"You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
"
"This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
[p]I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
[p]Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
"
"Here, madam.
"
"This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
[p]Upon his peril, that I have reserved
[p]To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.
"
"Madam,
[p]I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,
[p]Speak that which is not.
"
"What have I kept back?
"
"Enough to purchase what you have made known.
"
"Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
[p]Your wisdom in the deed.
"
"See, Caesar! O, behold,
[p]How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
[p]And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
[p]The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
[p]Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
[p]Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt
[p]Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
[p]Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
[p]O rarely base!
"
"Good queen, let us entreat you.
"
"O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
[p]That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
[p]Doing the honour of thy lordliness
[p]To one so meek, that mine own servant should
[p]Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
[p]Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
[p]That I some lady trifles have reserved,
[p]Immoment toys, things of such dignity
[p]As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
[p]Some nobler token I have kept apart
[p]For Livia and Octavia, to induce
[p]Their mediation; must I be unfolded
[p]With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
[p]Beneath the fall I have.
[p][To SELEUCUS]
[p]Prithee, go hence;
[p]Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
[p]Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
[p]Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
"
"Forbear, Seleucus.
"
"Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
[p]For things that others do; and, when we fall,
[p]We answer others' merits in our name,
[p]Are therefore to be pitied.
"
"Cleopatra,
[p]Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
[p]Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
[p]Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
[p]Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
[p]Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
[p]Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
[p]For we intend so to dispose you as
[p]Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
[p]Our care and pity is so much upon you,
[p]That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
"
"My master, and my lord!
"
"Not so. Adieu.
"
"He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
[p]Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.
"
"Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
[p]And we are for the dark.
"
"Hie thee again:
[p]I have spoke already, and it is provided;
[p]Go put it to the haste.
"
"Madam, I will.
"
"Where is the queen?
"
"Behold, sir.
"
"Dolabella!
"
"Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
[p]Which my love makes religion to obey,
[p]I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
[p]Intends his journey; and within three days
[p]You with your children will he send before:
[p]Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
[p]Your pleasure and my promise.
"
"Dolabella,
[p]I shall remain your debtor.
"
"I your servant,
[p]Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.
"
"Farewell, and thanks.
[p][Exit DOLABELLA]
[p]Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
[p]Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown
[p]In Rome, as well as I. mechanic slaves
[p]With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
[p]Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
[p]Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,
[p]And forced to drink their vapour.
"
"The gods forbid!
"
"Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors
[p]Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers
[p]Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
[p]Extemporally will stage us, and present
[p]Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
[p]Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
[p]Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
[p]I' the posture of a whore.
"
"O the good gods!
"
"Nay, that's certain.
"
"I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails
[p]Are stronger than mine eyes.
"
"Why, that's the way
[p]To fool their preparation, and to conquer
[p]Their most absurd intents.
[p][Re-enter CHARMIAN]
[p]Now, Charmian!
[p]Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
[p]My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,
[p]To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
[p]Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
[p]And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
[p]To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
[p]Wherefore's this noise?
"
"Here is a rural fellow
[p]That will not be denied your highness presence:
[p]He brings you figs.
"
"Let him come in.
[p][Exit Guardsman]
[p]What poor an instrument
[p]May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
[p]My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
[p]Of woman in me: now from head to foot
[p]I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
[p]No planet is of mine.
"
"This is the man.
"
"Avoid, and leave him.
[p][Exit Guardsman]
[p]Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
[p]That kills and pains not?
"
"Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party
[p]that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
[p]is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
[p]never recover.
"
"Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
"
"Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of
[p]them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
[p]but something given to lie; as a woman should not
[p]do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
[p]biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
[p]a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
[p]believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
[p]half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
[p]worm's an odd worm.
"
"Get thee hence; farewell.
"
"I wish you all joy of the worm.
"
"Farewell.
"
"You must think this, look you, that the worm will
[p]do his kind.
"
"Ay, ay; farewell.
"
"Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
[p]keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
[p]goodness in worm.
"
"Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
"
"Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
[p]not worth the feeding.
"
"Will it eat me?
"
"You must not think I am so simple but I know the
[p]devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
[p]woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
[p]not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
[p]gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
[p]that they make, the devils mar five.
"
"Well, get thee gone; farewell.
"
"Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.
"
"Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
[p]Immortal longings in me: now no more
[p]The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
[p]Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
[p]Antony call; I see him rouse himself
[p]To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
[p]The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
[p]To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
[p]Now to that name my courage prove my title!
[p]I am fire and air; my other elements
[p]I give to baser life. So; have you done?
[p]Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
[p]Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
[p][Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]
[p]Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
[p]If thou and nature can so gently part,
[p]The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
[p]Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
[p]If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
[p]It is not worth leave-taking.
"
"Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
[p]The gods themselves do weep!
"
"This proves me base:
[p]If she first meet the curled Antony,
[p]He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
[p]Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
[p]mortal wretch,
[p][To an asp, which she applies to her breast]
[p]With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
[p]Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
[p]Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
[p]That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
[p]Unpolicied!
"
"O eastern star!
"
"Peace, peace!
[p]Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
[p]That sucks the nurse asleep?
"
"O, break! O, break!
"
"As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--
[p]O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.
[p][Applying another asp to her arm]
[p]What should I stay--
"
"In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
[p]Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
[p]A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
[p]And golden Phoebus never be beheld
[p]Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
[p]I'll mend it, and then play.
"
"Where is the queen?
"
"Speak softly, wake her not.
"
"Caesar hath sent--
"
"Too slow a messenger.
[p][Applies an asp]
[p]O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.
"
"Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
"
"There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
"
"What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
"
"It is well done, and fitting for a princess
[p]Descended of so many royal kings.
[p]Ah, soldier!
"
"How goes it here?
"
"All dead.
"
"Caesar, thy thoughts
[p]Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
[p]To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
[p]So sought'st to hinder.
"
"O sir, you are too sure an augurer;
[p]That you did fear is done.
"
"Bravest at the last,
[p]She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
[p]Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
[p]I do not see them bleed.
"
"Who was last with them?
"
"A simple countryman, that brought her figs:
[p]This was his basket.
"
"Poison'd, then.
"
"O Caesar,
[p]This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:
[p]I found her trimming up the diadem
[p]On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
[p]And on the sudden dropp'd.
"
"O noble weakness!
[p]If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear
[p]By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,
[p]As she would catch another Antony
[p]In her strong toil of grace.
"
"Here, on her breast,
[p]There is a vent of blood and something blown:
[p]The like is on her arm.
"
"This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
[p]Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
[p]Upon the caves of Nile.
"
"Most probable
[p]That so she died; for her physician tells me
[p]She hath pursued conclusions infinite
[p]Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
[p]And bear her women from the monument:
[p]She shall be buried by her Antony:
[p]No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
[p]A pair so famous. High events as these
[p]Strike those that make them; and their story is
[p]No less in pity than his glory which
[p]Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
[p]In solemn show attend this funeral;
[p]And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
[p]High order in this great solemnity.
"
"Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
"
"Speak, speak.
"
"You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
"
"Resolved. resolved.
"
"First, you know Caius CORIOLANUS is chief enemy to the people.
"
"We know't, we know't.
"
"Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
[p]Is't a verdict?
"
"No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
"
"One word, good citizens.
"
"We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
[p]What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
[p]would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
[p]wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
[p]but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
[p]afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
[p]inventory to particularise their abundance; our
[p]sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
[p]our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
[p]speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
"
"Would you proceed especially against Caius CORIOLANUS?
"
"Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
"
"Consider you what services he has done for his country?
"
"Very well; and could be content to give him good
[p]report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
"
"Nay, but speak not maliciously.
"
"I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
[p]it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
[p]content to say it was for his country he did it to
[p]please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
[p]is, even till the altitude of his virtue.
"
"What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
[p]vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
"
"If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
[p]he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
[p][Shouts within]
[p]What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
[p]is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
"
"Come, come.
"
"Soft! who comes here?
"
"Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
[p]the people.
"
"He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
"
"What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
[p]With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
"
"Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
[p]had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
[p]which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
[p]suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
[p]have strong arms too.
"
"Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
[p]Will you undo yourselves?
"
"We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
"
"I tell you, friends, most charitable care
[p]Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
[p]Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
[p]Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
[p]Against the Roman state, whose course will on
[p]The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
[p]Of more strong link asunder than can ever
[p]Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
[p]The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
[p]Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
[p]You are transported by calamity
[p]Thither where more attends you, and you slander
[p]The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
[p]When you curse them as enemies.
"
"Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
[p]yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
[p]crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
[p]support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
[p]established against the rich, and provide more
[p]piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
[p]the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
[p]there's all the love they bear us.
"
"Either you must
[p]Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
[p]Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
[p]A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
[p]But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
[p]To stale 't a little more.
"
"Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
[p]fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
[p]you, deliver.
"
"There was a time when all the body's members
[p]Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
[p]That only like a gulf it did remain
[p]I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
[p]Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
[p]Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
[p]Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
[p]And, mutually participate, did minister
[p]Unto the appetite and affection common
[p]Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
"
"Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
"
"Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
[p]Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
[p]For, look you, I may make the belly smile
[p]As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
[p]To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
[p]That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
[p]As you malign our senators for that
[p]They are not such as you.
"
"Your belly's answer? What!
[p]The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
[p]The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
[p]Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
[p]With other muniments and petty helps
[p]In this our fabric, if that they--
"
"What then?
[p]'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?
"
"Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
[p]Who is the sink o' the body,--
"
"Well, what then?
"
"The former agents, if they did complain,
[p]What could the belly answer?
"
"I will tell you
[p]If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
[p]Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
"
"Ye're long about it.
"
"Note me this, good friend;
[p]Your most grave belly was deliberate,
[p]Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
[p]'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
[p]'That I receive the general food at first,
[p]Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
[p]Because I am the store-house and the shop
[p]Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
[p]I send it through the rivers of your blood,
[p]Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
[p]And, through the cranks and offices of man,
[p]The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
[p]From me receive that natural competency
[p]Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
[p]You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
"
"Ay, sir; well, well.
"
"'Though all at once cannot
[p]See what I do deliver out to each,
[p]Yet I can make my audit up, that all
[p]From me do back receive the flour of all,
[p]And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
"
"It was an answer: how apply you this?
"
"The senators of Rome are this good belly,
[p]And you the mutinous members; for examine
[p]Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
[p]Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
[p]No public benefit which you receive
[p]But it proceeds or comes from them to you
[p]And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
[p]You, the great toe of this assembly?
"
"I the great toe! why the great toe?
"
"For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
[p]Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
[p]Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
[p]Lead'st first to win some vantage.
[p]But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
[p]Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
[p]The one side must have bale.
[p][Enter CAIUS CORIOLANUS]
[p]Hail, noble CORIOLANUS!
"
"Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
[p]That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
[p]Make yourselves scabs?
"
"We have ever your good word.
"
"He that will give good words to thee will flatter
[p]Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
[p]That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
[p]The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
[p]Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
[p]Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
[p]Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
[p]Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
[p]To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
[p]And curse that justice did it.
[p]Who deserves greatness
[p]Deserves your hate; and your affections are
[p]A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
[p]Which would increase his evil. He that depends
[p]Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
[p]And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
[p]With every minute you do change a mind,
[p]And call him noble that was now your hate,
[p]Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
[p]That in these several places of the city
[p]You cry against the noble senate, who,
[p]Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
[p]Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
"
"For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
[p]The city is well stored.
"
"Hang 'em! They say!
[p]They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
[p]What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
[p]Who thrives and who declines; side factions
[p]and give out
[p]Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
[p]And feebling such as stand not in their liking
[p]Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
[p]grain enough!
[p]Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
[p]And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
[p]With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
[p]As I could pick my lance.
"
"Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
[p]For though abundantly they lack discretion,
[p]Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
[p]What says the other troop?
"
"They are dissolved: hang 'em!
[p]They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
[p]That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
[p]That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
[p]Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
[p]They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
[p]And a petition granted them, a strange one--
[p]To break the heart of generosity,
[p]And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
[p]As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
[p]Shouting their emulation.
"
"What is granted them?
"
"Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
[p]Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
[p]Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
[p]The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
[p]Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
[p]Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
[p]For insurrection's arguing.
"
"This is strange.
"
"Go, get you home, you fragments!
"
"Where's Caius CORIOLANUS?
"
"Here: what's the matter?
"
"The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
"
"I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
[p]Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
[p][Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators;]
[p]JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS]
"
"CORIOLANUS, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
[p]The Volsces are in arms.
"
"They have a leader,
[p]Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
[p]I sin in envying his nobility,
[p]And were I any thing but what I am,
[p]I would wish me only he.
"
"You have fought together.
"
"Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
[p]Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
[p]Only my wars with him: he is a lion
[p]That I am proud to hunt.
"
"Then, worthy CORIOLANUS,
[p]Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
"
"It is your former promise.
"
"Sir, it is;
[p]And I am constant. Titus TITUS, thou
[p]Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
[p]What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
"
"No, Caius CORIOLANUS;
[p]I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
[p]Ere stay behind this business.
"
"O, true-bred!
"
"Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
[p]Our greatest friends attend us.
"
"[To COMINIUS] Lead you on.
[p][To CORIOLANUS] Follow Cominius; we must follow you;]
[p]Right worthy you priority.
"
"Noble CORIOLANUS!
"
"[To the Citizens] Hence to your homes; be gone!
"
"Nay, let them follow:
[p]The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
[p]To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
[p]Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.
[p][Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS]
[p]and BRUTUS]
"
"Was ever man so proud as is this CORIOLANUS?
"
"He has no equal.
"
"When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
"
"Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
"
"Nay. but his taunts.
"
"Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
"
"Be-mock the modest moon.
"
"The present wars devour him: he is grown
[p]Too proud to be so valiant.
"
"Such a nature,
[p]Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
[p]Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
[p]His insolence can brook to be commanded
[p]Under Cominius.
"
"Fame, at the which he aims,
[p]In whom already he's well graced, can not
[p]Better be held nor more attain'd than by
[p]A place below the first: for what miscarries
[p]Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
[p]To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
[p]Will then cry out of CORIOLANUS 'O if he
[p]Had borne the business!'
"
"Besides, if things go well,
[p]Opinion that so sticks on CORIOLANUS shall
[p]Of his demerits rob Cominius.
"
"Come:
[p]Half all Cominius' honours are to CORIOLANUS.
[p]Though CORIOLANUS earned them not, and all his faults
[p]To CORIOLANUS shall be honours, though indeed
[p]In aught he merit not.
"
"Let's hence, and hear
[p]How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
[p]More than his singularity, he goes
[p]Upon this present action.
"
"Lets along.
"
"So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
[p]That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
[p]And know how we proceed.
"
"Is it not yours?
[p]What ever have been thought on in this state,
[p]That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
[p]Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
[p]Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
[p]I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
[p][Reads]
[p]'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
[p]Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
[p]The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
[p]Cominius, CORIOLANUS your old enemy,
[p]Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
[p]And Titus TITUS, a most valiant Roman,
[p]These three lead on this preparation
[p]Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
[p]Consider of it.'
"
"Our army's in the field
[p]We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
[p]To answer us.
"
"Nor did you think it folly
[p]To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
[p]They needs must show themselves; which
[p]in the hatching,
[p]It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
[p]We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
[p]To take in many towns ere almost Rome
[p]Should know we were afoot.
"
"Noble Aufidius,
[p]Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
[p]Let us alone to guard Corioli:
[p]If they set down before 's, for the remove
[p]Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
[p]They've not prepared for us.
"
"O, doubt not that;
[p]I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
[p]Some parcels of their power are forth already,
[p]And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
[p]If we and Caius CORIOLANUS chance to meet,
[p]'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
[p]Till one can do no more.
"
"The gods assist you!
"
"And keep your honours safe!
"
"Farewell.
"
"Farewell.
"
"Farewell.
"
"I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
[p]more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
[p]should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
[p]won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
[p]he would show most love. When yet he was but
[p]tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
[p]youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
[p]for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
[p]sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
[p]how honour would become such a person. that it was
[p]no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
[p]renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
[p]danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
[p]war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
[p]bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
[p]more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
[p]than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
[p]man.
"
"But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
"
"Then his good report should have been my son; I
[p]therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
[p]sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
[p]alike and none less dear than thine and my good
[p]CORIOLANUS, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
[p]country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
"
"Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
"
"Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
"
"Indeed, you shall not.
[p]Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
[p]See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
[p]As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
[p]Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
[p]'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
[p]Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
[p]With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
[p]Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
[p]Or all or lose his hire.
"
"His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
"
"Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
[p]Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
[p]When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
[p]Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
[p]At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
[p]We are fit to bid her welcome.
"
"Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
"
"He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
[p]And tread upon his neck.
"
"My ladies both, good day to you.
"
"Sweet madam.
"
"I am glad to see your ladyship.
"
"How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
[p]What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
[p]faith. How does your little son?
"
"I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
"
"He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
[p]look upon his school-master.
"
"O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
[p]very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
[p]Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
[p]confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
[p]butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
[p]again; and after it again; and over and over he
[p]comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
[p]fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
[p]teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
[p]it!
"
"One on 's father's moods.
"
"Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
"
"A crack, madam.
"
"Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
[p]the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
"
"No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
"
"Not out of doors!
"
"She shall, she shall.
"
"Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
[p]threshold till my lord return from the wars.
"
"Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
[p]you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
"
"I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
[p]my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
"
"Why, I pray you?
"
"'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
"
"You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
[p]the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
[p]Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
[p]were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
[p]pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
"
"No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
"
"In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
[p]excellent news of your husband.
"
"O, good madam, there can be none yet.
"
"Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
[p]him last night.
"
"Indeed, madam?
"
"In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
[p]Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
[p]whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
[p]our Roman power: your lord and Titus TITUS are set
[p]down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
[p]prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
[p]on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
"
"Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
[p]thing hereafter.
"
"Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
[p]disease our better mirth.
"
"In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
[p]Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
[p]solemness out o' door. and go along with us.
"
"No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
[p]you much mirth.
"
"Well, then, farewell.
"
"Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
"
"My horse to yours, no.
"
"'Tis done.
"
"Agreed.
"
"Say, has our general met the enemy?
"
"They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
"
"So, the good horse is mine.
"
"I'll buy him of you.
"
"No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
[p]For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
"
"How far off lie these armies?
"
"Within this mile and half.
"
"Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
[p]Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
[p]That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
[p]To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
[p][They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others]
[p]on the walls]
[p]Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
"
"No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
[p]That's lesser than a little.
[p][Drums afar off]
[p]Hark! our drums
[p]Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
[p]Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
[p]Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
[p]They'll open of themselves.
[p][Alarum afar off]
[p]Hark you. far off!
[p]There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
[p]Amongst your cloven army.
"
"O, they are at it!
"
"Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
"
"They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
[p]Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
[p]With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
[p]brave Titus:
[p]They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
[p]Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
[p]He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
[p]And he shall feel mine edge.
[p][Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their]
[p]trenches. Re-enter CORIOLANUS cursing]
"
"All the contagion of the south light on you,
[p]You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
[p]Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
[p]Further than seen and one infect another
[p]Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
[p]That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
[p]From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
[p]All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
[p]With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
[p]Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
[p]And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
[p]If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
[p]As they us to our trenches followed.
[p][Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and CORIOLANUS]
[p]follows them to the gates]
[p]So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
[p]'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
[p]Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.
"
"Fool-hardiness; not I.
"
"Nor I.
"
"See, they have shut him in.
"
"To the pot, I warrant him.
"
"What is become of CORIOLANUS?
"
"Slain, sir, doubtless.
"
"Following the fliers at the very heels,
[p]With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
[p]Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
[p]To answer all the city.
"
"O noble fellow!
[p]Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
[p]And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, CORIOLANUS:
[p]A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
[p]Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
[p]Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
[p]Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
[p]The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
[p]Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
[p]Were feverous and did tremble.
"
"Look, sir.
"
"O,'tis CORIOLANUS!
[p]Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
"
"This will I carry to Rome.
"
"And I this.
"
"A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
"
"See here these movers that do prize their hours
[p]At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
[p]Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
[p]Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
[p]Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
[p]And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
[p]There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
[p]Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
[p]Convenient numbers to make good the city;
[p]Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
[p]To help Cominius.
"
"Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
[p]Thy exercise hath been too violent for
[p]A second course of fight.
"
"Sir, praise me not;
[p]My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
[p]The blood I drop is rather physical
[p]Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
[p]I will appear, and fight.
"
"Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
[p]Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
[p]Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
[p]Prosperity be thy page!
"
"Thy friend no less
[p]Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
"
"Thou worthiest CORIOLANUS!
[p][Exit CORIOLANUS]
[p]Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
[p]Call thither all the officers o' the town,
[p]Where they shall know our mind: away!
"
"Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
[p]we are come off
[p]Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
[p]Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
[p]We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
[p]By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
[p]The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
[p]Lead their successes as we wish our own,
[p]That both our powers, with smiling
[p]fronts encountering,
[p]May give you thankful sacrifice.
[p][Enter a Messenger]
[p]Thy news?
"
"The citizens of Corioli have issued,
[p]And given to TITUS and to CORIOLANUS battle:
[p]I saw our party to their trenches driven,
[p]And then I came away.
"
"Though thou speak'st truth,
[p]Methinks thou speak'st not well.
[p]How long is't since?
"
"Above an hour, my lord.
"
"'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
[p]How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
[p]And bring thy news so late?
"
"Spies of the Volsces
[p]Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
[p]Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
[p]Half an hour since brought my report.
"
"Who's yonder,
[p]That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
[p]He has the stamp of CORIOLANUS; and I have
[p]Before-time seen him thus.
"
"[Within] Come I too late?
"
"The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
[p]More than I know the sound of CORIOLANUS' tongue
[p]From every meaner man.
"
"Come I too late?
"
"Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
[p]But mantled in your own.
"
"O, let me clip ye
[p]In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
[p]As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
[p]And tapers burn'd to bedward!
"
"Flower of warriors,
[p]How is it with Titus TITUS?
"
"As with a man busied about decrees:
[p]Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
[p]Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
[p]Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
[p]Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
[p]To let him slip at will.
"
"Where is that slave
[p]Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
[p]Where is he? call him hither.
"
"Let him alone;
[p]He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
[p]The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
[p]The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
[p]From rascals worse than they.
"
"But how prevail'd you?
"
"Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
[p]Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
[p]If not, why cease you till you are so?
"
"CORIOLANUS,
[p]We have at disadvantage fought and did
[p]Retire to win our purpose.
"
"How lies their battle? know you on which side
[p]They have placed their men of trust?
"
"As I guess, CORIOLANUS,
[p]Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
[p]Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
[p]Their very heart of hope.
"
"I do beseech you,
[p]By all the battles wherein we have fought,
[p]By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
[p]We have made to endure friends, that you directly
[p]Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
[p]And that you not delay the present, but,
[p]Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
[p]We prove this very hour.
"
"Though I could wish
[p]You were conducted to a gentle bath
[p]And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
[p]Deny your asking: take your choice of those
[p]That best can aid your action.
"
"Those are they
[p]That most are willing. If any such be here--
[p]As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
[p]Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
[p]Lesser his person than an ill report;
[p]If any think brave death outweighs bad life
[p]And that his country's dearer than himself;
[p]Let him alone, or so many so minded,
[p]Wave thus, to express his disposition,
[p]And follow CORIOLANUS.
[p][They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in]
[p]their arms, and cast up their caps]
[p]O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
[p]If these shows be not outward, which of you
[p]But is four Volsces? none of you but is
[p]Able to bear against the great Aufidius
[p]A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
[p]Though thanks to all, must I select
[p]from all: the rest
[p]Shall bear the business in some other fight,
[p]As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
[p]And four shall quickly draw out my command,
[p]Which men are best inclined.
"
"March on, my fellows:
[p]Make good this ostentation, and you shall
[p]Divide in all with us.
"
"So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
[p]As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
[p]Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
[p]For a short holding: if we lose the field,
[p]We cannot keep the town.
"
"Fear not our care, sir.
"
"Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
[p]Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.
"
"I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
[p]Worse than a promise-breaker.
"
"We hate alike:
[p]Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
[p]More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
"
"Let the first budger die the other's slave,
[p]And the gods doom him after!
"
"If I fly, CORIOLANUS,
[p]Holloa me like a hare.
"
"Within these three hours, Tullus,
[p]Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
[p]And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
[p]Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
[p]Wrench up thy power to the highest.
"
"Wert thou the Hector
[p]That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
[p]Thou shouldst not scape me here.
[p][They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of]
[p]AUFIDIUS. CORIOLANUS fights till they be driven in
[p]breathless]
[p]Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
[p]In your condemned seconds.
"
"If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
[p]Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
[p]Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
[p]Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
[p]I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
[p]And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
[p]dull tribunes,
[p]That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
[p]Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
[p]Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
[p]Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
[p]Having fully dined before.
[p][Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power,]
[p]from the pursuit]
"
"O general,
[p]Here is the steed, we the caparison:
[p]Hadst thou beheld--
"
"Pray now, no more: my mother,
[p]Who has a charter to extol her blood,
[p]When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
[p]As you have done; that's what I can; induced
[p]As you have been; that's for my country:
[p]He that has but effected his good will
[p]Hath overta'en mine act.
"
"You shall not be
[p]The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
[p]The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
[p]Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
[p]To hide your doings; and to silence that,
[p]Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
[p]Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
[p]In sign of what you are, not to reward
[p]What you have done--before our army hear me.
"
"I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
[p]To hear themselves remember'd.
"
"Should they not,
[p]Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
[p]And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
[p]Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
[p]The treasure in this field achieved and city,
[p]We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
[p]Before the common distribution, at
[p]Your only choice.
"
"I thank you, general;
[p]But cannot make my heart consent to take
[p]A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
[p]And stand upon my common part with those
[p]That have beheld the doing.
[p][A long flourish. They all cry 'CORIOLANUS! CORIOLANUS!']
[p]cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and TITUS
[p]stand bare]
"
"May these same instruments, which you profane,
[p]Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
[p]I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
[p]Made all of false-faced soothing!
[p]When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
[p]Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
[p]No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
[p]My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
[p]Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
[p]You shout me forth
[p]In acclamations hyperbolical;
[p]As if I loved my little should be dieted
[p]In praises sauced with lies.
"
"Too modest are you;
[p]More cruel to your good report than grateful
[p]To us that give you truly: by your patience,
[p]If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
[p]Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
[p]Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
[p]As to us, to all the world, that Caius CORIOLANUS
[p]Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
[p]My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
[p]With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
[p]For what he did before Corioli, call him,
[p]With all the applause and clamour of the host,
[p]CAIUS CORIOLANUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
[p]The addition nobly ever!
"
"Caius CORIOLANUS Coriolanus!
"
"I will go wash;
[p]And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
[p]Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
[p]I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
[p]To undercrest your good addition
[p]To the fairness of my power.
"
"So, to our tent;
[p]Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
[p]To Rome of our success. You, Titus TITUS,
[p]Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
[p]The best, with whom we may articulate,
[p]For their own good and ours.
"
"I shall, my lord.
"
"The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
[p]Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
[p]Of my lord general.
"
"Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
"
"I sometime lay here in Corioli
[p]At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
[p]He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
[p]But then Aufidius was within my view,
[p]And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
[p]To give my poor host freedom.
"
"O, well begg'd!
[p]Were he the butcher of my son, he should
[p]Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
"
"CORIOLANUS, his name?
"
"By Jupiter! forgot.
[p]I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
[p]Have we no wine here?
"
"Go we to our tent:
[p]The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
[p]It should be look'd to: come.
"
"The town is ta'en!
"
"'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
"
"Condition!
[p]I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
[p]Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
[p]What good condition can a treaty find
[p]I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, CORIOLANUS,
[p]I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
[p]And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
[p]As often as we eat. By the elements,
[p]If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
[p]He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
[p]Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
[p]I thought to crush him in an equal force,
[p]True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
[p]Or wrath or craft may get him.
"
"He's the devil.
"
"Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
[p]With only suffering stain by him; for him
[p]Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
[p]Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
[p]The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
[p]Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
[p]Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
[p]My hate to CORIOLANUS: where I find him, were it
[p]At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
[p]Against the hospitable canon, would I
[p]Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
[p]Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
[p]Be hostages for Rome.
"
"Will not you go?
"
"I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
[p]'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
[p]How the world goes, that to the pace of it
[p]I may spur on my journey.
"
"I shall, sir.
"
"The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
"
"Good or bad?
"
"Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
[p]love not CORIOLANUS.
"
"Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
"
"Pray you, who does the wolf love?
"
"The lamb.
"
"Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
[p]noble CORIOLANUS.
"
"He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
"
"He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
[p]are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
"
"Well, sir.
"
"In what enormity is CORIOLANUS poor in, that you two
[p]have not in abundance?
"
"He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
"
"Especially in pride.
"
"And topping all others in boasting.
"
"This is strange now: do you two know how you are
[p]censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
[p]right-hand file? do you?
"
"Why, how are we censured?
"
"Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?
"
"Well, well, sir, well.
"
"Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
[p]occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
[p]give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
[p]your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
[p]pleasure to you in being so. You blame CORIOLANUS for
[p]being proud?
"
"We do it not alone, sir.
"
"I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
[p]are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
[p]single: your abilities are too infant-like for
[p]doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
[p]could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
[p]and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
[p]O that you could!
"
"What then, sir?
"
"Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
[p]proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
[p]any in Rome.
"
"Menenius, you are known well enough too.
"
"I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
[p]loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
[p]Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
[p]favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
[p]upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
[p]with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
[p]of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
[p]malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
[p]you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
[p]you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
[p]crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
[p]delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
[p]compound with the major part of your syllables: and
[p]though I must be content to bear with those that say
[p]you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
[p]tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
[p]the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
[p]well enough too? what barm can your bisson
[p]conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
[p]known well enough too?
"
"Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
"
"You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
[p]are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
[p]wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
[p]cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
[p]and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
[p]second day of audience. When you are hearing a
[p]matter between party and party, if you chance to be
[p]pinched with the colic, you make faces like
[p]mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
[p]patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
[p]dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
[p]by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
[p]cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
[p]a pair of strange ones.
"
"Come, come, you are well understood to be a
[p]perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
[p]bencher in the Capitol.
"
"Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
[p]encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
[p]you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
[p]wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
[p]so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
[p]cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
[p]saddle. Yet you must be saying, CORIOLANUS is proud;
[p]who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
[p]since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
[p]best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
[p]your worships: more of your conversation would
[p]infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
[p]plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
[p][BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside]
[p][Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA]
[p]How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
[p]were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
[p]your eyes so fast?
"
"Honourable Menenius, my boy CORIOLANUS approaches; for
[p]the love of Juno, let's go.
"
"Ha! CORIOLANUS coming home!
"
"Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
[p]approbation.
"
"Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
[p]CORIOLANUS coming home!
"
"[together with Virgilia] Nay, 'tis true.
"
"Nay, 'tis true.
"
"Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
[p]another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
[p]at home for you.
"
"I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
[p]me!
"
"Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
"
"A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
[p]years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
[p]the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
[p]Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
[p]of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
[p]not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
"
"O, no, no, no.
"
"O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
"
"So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
[p]victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
"
"On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
[p]with the oaken garland.
"
"Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
"
"Titus TITUS writes, they fought together, but
[p]Aufidius got off.
"
"And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
[p]an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
[p]fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
[p]that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
"
"Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
[p]has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
[p]son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
[p]action outdone his former deeds doubly
"
"In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
"
"Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
[p]true purchasing.
"
"The gods grant them true!
"
"True! pow, wow.
"
"True! I'll be sworn they are true.
[p]Where is he wounded?
[p][To the Tribunes]
[p]God save your good worships! CORIOLANUS is coming
[p]home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
"
"I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
[p]large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
[p]stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
[p]Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
"
"One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
[p]nine that I know.
"
"He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
[p]wounds upon him.
"
"Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
[p][A shout and flourish]
[p]Hark! the trumpets.
"
"These are the ushers of CORIOLANUS: before him he
[p]carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
[p]Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
[p]Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
[p][A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the]
[p]general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS,
[p]crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and
[p]Soldiers, and a Herald]
"
"Know, Rome, that all alone CORIOLANUS did fight
[p]Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
[p]With fame, a name to Caius CORIOLANUS; these
[p]In honour follows Coriolanus.
[p]Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
"
"Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
"
"No more of this; it does offend my heart:
[p]Pray now, no more.
"
"Look, sir, your mother!
"
"O,
[p]You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
[p]For my prosperity!
"
"Nay, my good soldier, up;
[p]My gentle CORIOLANUS, worthy Caius, and
[p]By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
[p]What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
[p]But O, thy wife!
"
"My gracious silence, hail!
[p]Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
[p]That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
[p]Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
[p]And mothers that lack sons.
"
"Now, the gods crown thee!
"
"And live you yet?
[p][To VALERIA]
[p]O my sweet lady, pardon.
"
"I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
[p]And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
"
"A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
[p]And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
[p]A curse begin at very root on's heart,
[p]That is not glad to see thee! You are three
[p]That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
[p]We have some old crab-trees here
[p]at home that will not
[p]Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
[p]We call a nettle but a nettle and
[p]The faults of fools but folly.
"
"Ever right.
"
"Menenius ever, ever.
"
"Give way there, and go on!
"
"[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA] Your hand, and yours:
[p]Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
[p]The good patricians must be visited;
[p]From whom I have received not only greetings,
[p]But with them change of honours.
"
"I have lived
[p]To see inherited my very wishes
[p]And the buildings of my fancy: only
[p]There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
[p]Our Rome will cast upon thee.
"
"Know, good mother,
[p]I had rather be their servant in my way,
[p]Than sway with them in theirs.
"
"On, to the Capitol!
[p][Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before.]
[p]BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward]
"
"All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
[p]Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
[p]Into a rapture lets her baby cry
[p]While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
[p]Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
[p]Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
[p]Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
[p]With variable complexions, all agreeing
[p]In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
[p]Do press among the popular throngs and puff
[p]To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
[p]Commit the war of white and damask in
[p]Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
[p]Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
[p]As if that whatsoever god who leads him
[p]Were slily crept into his human powers
[p]And gave him graceful posture.
"
"On the sudden,
[p]I warrant him consul.
"
"Then our office may,
[p]During his power, go sleep.
"
"He cannot temperately transport his honours
[p]From where he should begin and end, but will
[p]Lose those he hath won.
"
"In that there's comfort.
"
"Doubt not
[p]The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
[p]Upon their ancient malice will forget
[p]With the least cause these his new honours, which
[p]That he will give them make I as little question
[p]As he is proud to do't.
"
"I heard him swear,
[p]Were he to stand for consul, never would he
[p]Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
[p]The napless vesture of humility;
[p]Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
[p]To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
"
"'Tis right.
"
"It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
[p]Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
[p]And the desire of the nobles.
"
"I wish no better
[p]Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
[p]In execution.
"
"'Tis most like he will.
"
"It shall be to him then as our good wills,
[p]A sure destruction.
"
"So it must fall out
[p]To him or our authorities. For an end,
[p]We must suggest the people in what hatred
[p]He still hath held them; that to's power he would
[p]Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
[p]Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
[p]In human action and capacity,
[p]Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
[p]Than camels in the war, who have their provand
[p]Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
[p]For sinking under them.
"
"This, as you say, suggested
[p]At some time when his soaring insolence
[p]Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
[p]If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
[p]As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
[p]To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
[p]Shall darken him for ever.
"
"What's the matter?
"
"You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
[p]That CORIOLANUS shall be consul:
[p]I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
[p]The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
[p]Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
[p]Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
[p]As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
[p]A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
[p]I never saw the like.
"
"Let's to the Capitol;
[p]And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
[p]But hearts for the event.
"
"Have with you.
"
"Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
[p]for consulships?
"
"Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
[p]Coriolanus will carry it.
"
"That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
[p]loves not the common people.
"
"Faith, there had been many great men that have
[p]flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
[p]be many that they have loved, they know not
[p]wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
[p]they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
[p]Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
[p]him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
[p]disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
[p]them plainly see't.
"
"If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
[p]he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
[p]good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
[p]devotion than can render it him; and leaves
[p]nothing undone that may fully discover him their
[p]opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
[p]displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
[p]dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
"
"He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
[p]ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
[p]having been supple and courteous to the people,
[p]bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
[p]an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
[p]planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
[p]in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
[p]silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
[p]ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
[p]malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
[p]reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
"
"No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
[p]are coming.
[p][A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS]
[p]the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,
[p]SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their
[p]places; the Tribunes take their Places by
[p]themselves. CORIOLANUS stands]
"
"Having determined of the Volsces and
[p]To send for Titus TITUS, it remains,
[p]As the main point of this our after-meeting,
[p]To gratify his noble service that
[p]Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
[p]please you,
[p]Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
[p]The present consul, and last general
[p]In our well-found successes, to report
[p]A little of that worthy work perform'd
[p]By Caius CORIOLANUS Coriolanus, whom
[p]We met here both to thank and to remember
[p]With honours like himself.
"
"Speak, good Cominius:
[p]Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
[p]Rather our state's defective for requital
[p]Than we to stretch it out.
[p][To the Tribunes]
[p]Masters o' the people,
[p]We do request your kindest ears, and after,
[p]Your loving motion toward the common body,
[p]To yield what passes here.
"
"We are convented
[p]Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
[p]Inclinable to honour and advance
[p]The theme of our assembly.
"
"Which the rather
[p]We shall be blest to do, if he remember
[p]A kinder value of the people than
[p]He hath hereto prized them at.
"
"That's off, that's off;
[p]I would you rather had been silent. Please you
[p]To hear Cominius speak?
"
"Most willingly;
[p]But yet my caution was more pertinent
[p]Than the rebuke you give it.
"
"He loves your people
[p]But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
[p]Worthy Cominius, speak.
[p][CORIOLANUS offers to go away]
[p]Nay, keep your place.
"
"Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
[p]What you have nobly done.
"
"Your horror's pardon:
[p]I had rather have my wounds to heal again
[p]Than hear say how I got them.
"
"Sir, I hope
[p]My words disbench'd you not.
"
"No, sir: yet oft,
[p]When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
[p]You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
[p]your people,
[p]I love them as they weigh.
"
"Pray now, sit down.
"
"I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
[p]When the alarum were struck than idly sit
[p]To hear my nothings monster'd.
"
"Masters of the people,
[p]Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
[p]That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
[p]He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
[p]Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
"
"I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
[p]Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
[p]That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
[p]Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
[p]The man I speak of cannot in the world
[p]Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
[p]When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
[p]Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
[p]Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
[p]When with his Amazonian chin he drove
[p]The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
[p]An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
[p]Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
[p]And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
[p]When he might act the woman in the scene,
[p]He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
[p]Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
[p]Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
[p]And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
[p]He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
[p]Before and in Corioli, let me say,
[p]I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
[p]And by his rare example made the coward
[p]Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
[p]A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
[p]And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
[p]Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
[p]He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
[p]Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
[p]The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
[p]With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
[p]And with a sudden reinforcement struck
[p]Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
[p]When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
[p]His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
[p]Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
[p]And to the battle came he; where he did
[p]Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
[p]'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
[p]Both field and city ours, he never stood
[p]To ease his breast with panting.
"
"Worthy man!
"
"He cannot but with measure fit the honours
[p]Which we devise him.
"
"Our spoils he kick'd at,
[p]And look'd upon things precious as they were
[p]The common muck of the world: he covets less
[p]Than misery itself would give; rewards
[p]His deeds with doing them, and is content
[p]To spend the time to end it.
"
"He's right noble:
[p]Let him be call'd for.
"
"Call Coriolanus.
"
"He doth appear.
"
"The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
[p]To make thee consul.
"
"I do owe them still
[p]My life and services.
"
"It then remains
[p]That you do speak to the people.
"
"I do beseech you,
[p]Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
[p]Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
[p]For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
[p]That I may pass this doing.
"
"Sir, the people
[p]Must have their voices; neither will they bate
[p]One jot of ceremony.
"
"Put them not to't:
[p]Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
[p]Take to you, as your predecessors have,
[p]Your honour with your form.
"
"It is apart
[p]That I shall blush in acting, and might well
[p]Be taken from the people.
"
"Mark you that?
"
"To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
[p]Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
[p]As if I had received them for the hire
[p]Of their breath only!
"
"Do not stand upon't.
[p]We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
[p]Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
[p]Wish we all joy and honour.Senators. To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
[p][Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS]
[p]and BRUTUS]
"
"You see how he intends to use the people.
"
"May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
[p]As if he did contemn what he requested
[p]Should be in them to give.
"
"Come, we'll inform them
[p]Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
[p]I know, they do attend us.
"
"Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
"
"We may, sir, if we will.
"
"We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
[p]power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
[p]his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
[p]tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
[p]he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
[p]our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
[p]monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
[p]were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
[p]which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
[p]monstrous members.
"
"And to make us no better thought of, a little help
[p]will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
[p]himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
"
"We have been called so of many; not that our heads
[p]are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
[p]but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
[p]truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
[p]one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
[p]and their consent of one direct way should be at
[p]once to all the points o' the compass.
"
"Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
[p]fly?
"
"Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
[p]will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
[p]if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.
"
"Why that way?
"
"To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
[p]melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
[p]for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.
"
"You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
"
"Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
[p]that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
[p]say, if he would incline to the people, there was
[p]never a worthier man.
[p][Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility,]
[p]with MENENIUS]
[p]Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
[p]behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
[p]come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
[p]by threes. He's to make his requests by
[p]particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
[p]honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
[p]tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
[p]you shall go by him.
"
"Content, content.
"
"O sir, you are not right: have you not known
[p]The worthiest men have done't?
"
"What must I say?
[p]'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
[p]My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
[p]I got them in my country's service, when
[p]Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
[p]From the noise of our own drums.'
"
"O me, the gods!
[p]You must not speak of that: you must desire them
[p]To think upon you.
"
"Think upon me! hang 'em!
[p]I would they would forget me, like the virtues
[p]Which our divines lose by 'em.
"
"You'll mar all:
[p]I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
[p]In wholesome manner.
"
"Bid them wash their faces
[p]And keep their teeth clean.
[p][Re-enter two of the Citizens]
[p]So, here comes a brace.
[p][Re-enter a third Citizen]
[p]You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
"
"We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
"
"Mine own desert.
"
"Your own desert!
"
"Ay, but not mine own desire.
"
"How not your own desire?
"
"No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
[p]poor with begging.
"
"You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
[p]gain by you.
"
"Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
"
"The price is to ask it kindly.
"
"Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
[p]show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
[p]good voice, sir; what say you?
"
"You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
"
"A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
[p]begged. I have your alms: adieu.
"
"But this is something odd.
"
"An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
"
"Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
[p]voices that I may be consul, I have here the
[p]customary gown.
"
"You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
[p]have not deserved nobly.
"
"Your enigma?
"
"You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
[p]been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
[p]the common people.
"
"You should account me the more virtuous that I have
[p]not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
[p]sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
[p]estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
[p]gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
[p]rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
[p]the insinuating nod and be off to them most
[p]counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
[p]bewitchment of some popular man and give it
[p]bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
[p]I may be consul.
"
"We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
[p]you our voices heartily.
"
"You have received many wounds for your country.
"
"I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
[p]will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
"
"The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
"
"Most sweet voices!
[p]Better it is to die, better to starve,
[p]Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
[p]Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
[p]To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
[p]Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
[p]What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
[p]The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
[p]And mountainous error be too highly heapt
[p]For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
[p]Let the high office and the honour go
[p]To one that would do thus. I am half through;
[p]The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
[p][Re-enter three Citizens more]
[p]Here come more voices.
[p]Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
[p]Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
[p]Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
[p]I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
[p]Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
[p]Indeed I would be consul.
"
"He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
[p]man's voice.
"
"Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
[p]and make him good friend to the people!
"
"Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
"
"Worthy voices!
"
"You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
[p]Endue you with the people's voice: remains
[p]That, in the official marks invested, you
[p]Anon do meet the senate.
"
"Is this done?
"
"The custom of request you have discharged:
[p]The people do admit you, and are summon'd
[p]To meet anon, upon your approbation.
"
"Where? at the senate-house?
"
"There, Coriolanus.
"
"May I change these garments?
"
"You may, sir.
"
"That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
[p]Repair to the senate-house.
"
"I'll keep you company. Will you along?
"
"We stay here for the people.
"
"Fare you well.
[p][Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS]
[p]He has it now, and by his looks methink
[p]'Tis warm at 's heart.
"
"With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
[p]will you dismiss the people?
"
"How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
"
"He has our voices, sir.
"
"We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
"
"Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
[p]He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
"
"Certainly
[p]He flouted us downright.
"
"No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
"
"Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
[p]He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
[p]His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
"
"Why, so he did, I am sure.
"
"No, no; no man saw 'em.
"
"He said he had wounds, which he could show
[p]in private;
[p]And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
[p]'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
[p]But by your voices, will not so permit me;
[p]Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
[p]Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
[p]Your most sweet voices: now you have left
[p]your voices,
[p]I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
"
"Why either were you ignorant to see't,
[p]Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
[p]To yield your voices?
"
"Could you not have told him
[p]As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
[p]But was a petty servant to the state,
[p]He was your enemy, ever spake against
[p]Your liberties and the charters that you bear
[p]I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
[p]A place of potency and sway o' the state,
[p]If he should still malignantly remain
[p]Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
[p]Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
[p]That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
[p]Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
[p]Would think upon you for your voices and
[p]Translate his malice towards you into love,
[p]Standing your friendly lord.
"
"Thus to have said,
[p]As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
[p]And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
[p]Either his gracious promise, which you might,
[p]As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
[p]Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
[p]Which easily endures not article
[p]Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
[p]You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
[p]And pass'd him unelected.
"
"Did you perceive
[p]He did solicit you in free contempt
[p]When he did need your loves, and do you think
[p]That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
[p]When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
[p]No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
[p]Against the rectorship of judgment?
"
"Have you
[p]Ere now denied the asker? and now again
[p]Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
[p]Your sued-for tongues?
"
"He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
"
"And will deny him:
[p]I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
"
"I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
"
"Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
[p]They have chose a consul that will from them take
[p]Their liberties; make them of no more voice
[p]Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
[p]As therefore kept to do so.
"
"Let them assemble,
[p]And on a safer judgment all revoke
[p]Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
[p]And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
[p]With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
[p]How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
[p]Thinking upon his services, took from you
[p]The apprehension of his present portance,
[p]Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
[p]After the inveterate hate he bears you.
"
"Lay
[p]A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
[p]No impediment between, but that you must
[p]Cast your election on him.
"
"Say, you chose him
[p]More after our commandment than as guided
[p]By your own true affections, and that your minds,
[p]Preoccupied with what you rather must do
[p]Than what you should, made you against the grain
[p]To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
"
"Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
[p]How youngly he began to serve his country,
[p]How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
[p]The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
[p]That Ancus CORIOLANUS, Numa's daughter's son,
[p]Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
[p]Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
[p]That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
[p]And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,
[p]Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,
[p]Was his great ancestor.
"
"One thus descended,
[p]That hath beside well in his person wrought
[p]To be set high in place, we did commend
[p]To your remembrances: but you have found,
[p]Scaling his present bearing with his past,
[p]That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
[p]Your sudden approbation.
"
"Say, you ne'er had done't--
[p]Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
[p]And presently, when you have drawn your number,
[p]Repair to the Capitol.
"
"We will so: almost all
[p]Repent in their election.
"
"Let them go on;
[p]This mutiny were better put in hazard,
[p]Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
[p]If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
[p]With their refusal, both observe and answer
[p]The vantage of his anger.
"
"To the Capitol, come:
[p]We will be there before the stream o' the people;
[p]And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
[p]Which we have goaded onward.
"
"Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
"
"He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
[p]Our swifter composition.
"
"So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
[p]Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
[p]Upon's again.
"
"They are worn, lord consul, so,
[p]That we shall hardly in our ages see
[p]Their banners wave again.
"
"Saw you Aufidius?
"
"On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
[p]Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
[p]Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
"
"Spoke he of me?
"
"He did, my lord.
"
"How? what?
"
"How often he had met you, sword to sword;
[p]That of all things upon the earth he hated
[p]Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
[p]To hopeless restitution, so he might
[p]Be call'd your vanquisher.
"
"At Antium lives he?
"
"At Antium.
"
"I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
[p]To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
[p][Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS]
[p]Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
[p]The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
[p]For they do prank them in authority,
[p]Against all noble sufferance.
"
"Pass no further.
"
"Ha! what is that?
"
"It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
"
"What makes this change?
"
"The matter?
"
"Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
"
"Cominius, no.
"
"Have I had children's voices?
"
"Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
"
"The people are incensed against him.
"
"Stop,
[p]Or all will fall in broil.
"
"Are these your herd?
[p]Must these have voices, that can yield them now
[p]And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
[p]your offices?
[p]You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
[p]Have you not set them on?
"
"Be calm, be calm.
"
"It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
[p]To curb the will of the nobility:
[p]Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
[p]Nor ever will be ruled.
"
"Call't not a plot:
[p]The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
[p]When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
[p]Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
[p]Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
"
"Why, this was known before.
"
"Not to them all.
"
"Have you inform'd them sithence?
"
"How! I inform them!
"
"You are like to do such business.
"
"Not unlike,
[p]Each way, to better yours.
"
"Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
[p]Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
[p]Your fellow tribune.
"
"You show too much of that
[p]For which the people stir: if you will pass
[p]To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
[p]Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
[p]Or never be so noble as a consul,
[p]Nor yoke with him for tribune.
"
"Let's be calm.
"
"The people are abused; set on. This paltering
[p]Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
[p]Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
[p]I' the plain way of his merit.
"
"Tell me of corn!
[p]This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
"
"Not now, not now.
"
"Not in this heat, sir, now.
"
"Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
[p]I crave their pardons:
[p]For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
[p]Regard me as I do not flatter, and
[p]Therein behold themselves: I say again,
[p]In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
[p]The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
[p]Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
[p]and scatter'd,
[p]By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
[p]Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
[p]Which they have given to beggars.
"
"Well, no more.
"
"No more words, we beseech you.
"
"How! no more!
[p]As for my country I have shed my blood,
[p]Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
[p]Coin words till their decay against those measles,
[p]Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
[p]The very way to catch them.
"
"You speak o' the people,
[p]As if you were a god to punish, not
[p]A man of their infirmity.
"
"'Twere well
[p]We let the people know't.
"
"What, what? his choler?
"
"Choler!
[p]Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
[p]By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
"
"It is a mind
[p]That shall remain a poison where it is,
[p]Not poison any further.
"
"Shall remain!
[p]Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
[p]His absolute 'shall'?
"
"'Twas from the canon.
"
"'Shall'!
[p]O good but most unwise patricians! why,
[p]You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
[p]Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
[p]That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
[p]The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
[p]To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
[p]And make your channel his? If he have power
[p]Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
[p]Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
[p]Be not as common fools; if you are not,
[p]Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
[p]If they be senators: and they are no less,
[p]When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
[p]Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
[p]And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
[p]His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
[p]Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
[p]It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
[p]To know, when two authorities are up,
[p]Neither supreme, how soon confusion
[p]May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
[p]The one by the other.
"
"Well, on to the market-place.
"
"Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
[p]The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
[p]Sometime in Greece,--
"
"Well, well, no more of that.
"
"Though there the people had more absolute power,
[p]I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
[p]The ruin of the state.
"
"Why, shall the people give
[p]One that speaks thus their voice?
"
"I'll give my reasons,
[p]More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
[p]Was not our recompense, resting well assured
[p]That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
[p]Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
[p]They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
[p]Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
[p]Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
[p]Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
[p]Which they have often made against the senate,
[p]All cause unborn, could never be the motive
[p]Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
[p]How shall this bisson multitude digest
[p]The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
[p]What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
[p]We are the greater poll, and in true fear
[p]They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
[p]The nature of our seats and make the rabble
[p]Call our cares fears; which will in time
[p]Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
[p]The crows to peck the eagles.
"
"Come, enough.
"
"Enough, with over-measure.
"
"No, take more:
[p]What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
[p]Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
[p]Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
[p]Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
[p]Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
[p]Of general ignorance,--it must omit
[p]Real necessities, and give way the while
[p]To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
[p]it follows,
[p]Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
[p]You that will be less fearful than discreet,
[p]That love the fundamental part of state
[p]More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
[p]A noble life before a long, and wish
[p]To jump a body with a dangerous physic
[p]That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
[p]The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
[p]The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
[p]Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
[p]Of that integrity which should become't,
[p]Not having the power to do the good it would,
[p]For the in which doth control't.
"
"Has said enough.
"
"Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
[p]As traitors do.
"
"Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
[p]What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
[p]On whom depending, their obedience fails
[p]To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
[p]When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
[p]Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
[p]Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
[p]And throw their power i' the dust.
"
"Manifest treason!
"
"This a consul? no.
"
"The aediles, ho!
[p][Enter an AEdile]
[p]Let him be apprehended.
"
"Go, call the people:
[p][Exit AEdile]
[p]in whose name myself
[p]Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
[p]A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
[p]And follow to thine answer.
"
"Hence, old goat!
"
"Aged sir, hands off.
"
"Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
[p]Out of thy garments.
"
"Help, ye citizens!
[p][Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with]
[p]the AEdiles]
"
"On both sides more respect.
"
"Here's he that would take from you all your power.
"
"Seize him, AEdiles!
"
"Down with him! down with him!
[p][They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying]
[p]'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
[p]'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
[p]'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'
"
"What is about to be? I am out of breath;
[p]Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
[p]To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
[p]Speak, good Sicinius.
"
"Hear me, people; peace!
"
"Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
"
"You are at point to lose your liberties:
[p]CORIOLANUS would have all from you; CORIOLANUS,
[p]Whom late you have named for consul.
"
"Fie, fie, fie!
[p]This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
"
"To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
"
"What is the city but the people?
"
"True,
[p]The people are the city.
"
"By the consent of all, we were establish'd
[p]The people's magistrates.
"
"You so remain.
"
"And so are like to do.
"
"That is the way to lay the city flat;
[p]To bring the roof to the foundation,
[p]And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
[p]In heaps and piles of ruin.
"
"This deserves death.
"
"Or let us stand to our authority,
[p]Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
[p]Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
[p]We were elected theirs, CORIOLANUS is worthy
[p]Of present death.
"
"Therefore lay hold of him;
[p]Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
[p]Into destruction cast him.
"
"AEdiles, seize him!
"
"Yield, CORIOLANUS, yield!
"
"Hear me one word;
[p]Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
"
"Peace, peace!
"
"[To BRUTUS] Be that you seem, truly your
[p]country's friend,
[p]And temperately proceed to what you would
[p]Thus violently redress.
"
"Sir, those cold ways,
[p]That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
[p]Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
[p]And bear him to the rock.
"
"No, I'll die here.
[p][Drawing his sword]
[p]There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
[p]Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
"
"Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
"
"Lay hands upon him.
"
"Help CORIOLANUS, help,
[p]You that be noble; help him, young and old!
"
"Down with him, down with him!
[p][In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the]
[p]People, are beat in]
"
"Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
[p]All will be naught else.
"
"Get you gone.
"
"Stand fast;
[p]We have as many friends as enemies.
"
"Sham it be put to that?
"
"The gods forbid!
[p]I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
[p]Leave us to cure this cause.
"
"For 'tis a sore upon us,
[p]You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
"
"Come, sir, along with us.
"
"I would they were barbarians--as they are,
[p]Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
[p]Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
"
"Be gone;
[p]Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
[p]One time will owe another.
"
"On fair ground
[p]I could beat forty of them.
"
"I could myself
[p]Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
[p]two tribunes:
[p]But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
[p]And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
[p]Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
[p]Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
[p]Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
[p]What they are used to bear.
"
"Pray you, be gone:
[p]I'll try whether my old wit be in request
[p]With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
[p]With cloth of any colour.
"
"Nay, come away.
"
"This man has marr'd his fortune.
"
"His nature is too noble for the world:
[p]He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
[p]Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
[p]What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
[p]And, being angry, does forget that ever
[p]He heard the name of death.
[p][A noise within]
[p]Here's goodly work!
"
"I would they were abed!
"
"I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
[p]Could he not speak 'em fair?
"
"Where is this viper
[p]That would depopulate the city and
[p]Be every man himself?
"
"You worthy tribunes,--
"
"He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
[p]With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
[p]And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
[p]Than the severity of the public power
[p]Which he so sets at nought.
"
"He shall well know
[p]The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
[p]And we their hands.
"
"He shall, sure on't.
"
"Sir, sir,--
"
"Peace!
"
"Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
[p]With modest warrant.
"
"Sir, how comes't that you
[p]Have holp to make this rescue?
"
"Hear me speak:
[p]As I do know the consul's worthiness,
[p]So can I name his faults,--
"
"Consul! what consul?
"
"The consul Coriolanus.
"
"He consul!
"
"No, no, no, no, no.
"
"If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
[p]I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
[p]The which shall turn you to no further harm
[p]Than so much loss of time.
"
"Speak briefly then;
[p]For we are peremptory to dispatch
[p]This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
[p]Were but one danger, and to keep him here
[p]Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
[p]He dies to-night.
"
"Now the good gods forbid
[p]That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
[p]Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
[p]In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
[p]Should now eat up her own!
"
"He's a disease that must be cut away.
"
"O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
[p]Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
[p]What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
[p]Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
[p]Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
[p]By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
[p]And what is left, to lose it by his country,
[p]Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
[p]A brand to the end o' the world.
"
"This is clean kam.
"
"Merely awry: when he did love his country,
[p]It honour'd him.
"
"The service of the foot
[p]Being once gangrened, is not then respected
[p]For what before it was.
"
"We'll hear no more.
[p]Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
[p]Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
[p]Spread further.
"
"One word more, one word.
[p]This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
[p]The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
[p]Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
[p]Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
[p]And sack great Rome with Romans.
"
"If it were so,--
"
"What do ye talk?
[p]Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
[p]Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
"
"Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
[p]Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
[p]In bolted language; meal and bran together
[p]He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
[p]I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
[p]Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
[p]In peace, to his utmost peril.
"
"Noble tribunes,
[p]It is the humane way: the other course
[p]Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
[p]Unknown to the beginning.
"
"Noble Menenius,
[p]Be you then as the people's officer.
[p]Masters, lay down your weapons.
"
"Go not home.
"
"Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
[p]Where, if you bring not CORIOLANUS, we'll proceed
[p]In our first way.
"
"I'll bring him to you.
[p][To the Senators]
[p]Let me desire your company: he must come,
[p]Or what is worst will follow.
"
"Pray you, let's to him.
"
"Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
[p]Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
[p]Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
[p]That the precipitation might down stretch
[p]Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
[p]Be thus to them.
"
"You do the nobler.
"
"I muse my mother
[p]Does not approve me further, who was wont
[p]To call them woollen vassals, things created
[p]To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
[p]In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
[p]When one but of my ordinance stood up
[p]To speak of peace or war.
[p][Enter VOLUMNIA]
[p]I talk of you:
[p]Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
[p]False to my nature? Rather say I play
[p]The man I am.
"
"O, sir, sir, sir,
[p]I would have had you put your power well on,
[p]Before you had worn it out.
"
"Let go.
"
"You might have been enough the man you are,
[p]With striving less to be so; lesser had been
[p]The thwartings of your dispositions, if
[p]You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
[p]Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
"
"Let them hang.
"
"Ay, and burn too.
"
"Come, come, you have been too rough, something
[p]too rough;
[p]You must return and mend it.
"
"There's no remedy;
[p]Unless, by not so doing, our good city
[p]Cleave in the midst, and perish.
"
"Pray, be counsell'd:
[p]I have a heart as little apt as yours,
[p]But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
[p]To better vantage.
"
"Well said, noble woman?
[p]Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
[p]The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
[p]For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
[p]Which I can scarcely bear.
"
"What must I do?
"
"Return to the tribunes.
"
"Well, what then? what then?
"
"Repent what you have spoke.
"
"For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
[p]Must I then do't to them?
"
"You are too absolute;
[p]Though therein you can never be too noble,
[p]But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
[p]Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
[p]I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
[p]In peace what each of them by the other lose,
[p]That they combine not there.
"
"Tush, tush!
"
"A good demand.
"
"If it be honour in your wars to seem
[p]The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
[p]You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
[p]That it shall hold companionship in peace
[p]With honour, as in war, since that to both
[p]It stands in like request?
"
"Why force you this?
"
"Because that now it lies you on to speak
[p]To the people; not by your own instruction,
[p]Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
[p]But with such words that are but rooted in
[p]Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
[p]Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
[p]Now, this no more dishonours you at all
[p]Than to take in a town with gentle words,
[p]Which else would put you to your fortune and
[p]The hazard of much blood.
[p]I would dissemble with my nature where
[p]My fortunes and my friends at stake required
[p]I should do so in honour: I am in this,
[p]Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
[p]And you will rather show our general louts
[p]How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
[p]For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
[p]Of what that want might ruin.
"
"Noble lady!
[p]Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
[p]Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
[p]Of what is past.
"
"I prithee now, my son,
[p]Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
[p]And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
[p]Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
[p]Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
[p]More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
[p]Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
[p]Now humble as the ripest mulberry
[p]That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
[p]Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
[p]Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
[p]Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
[p]In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
[p]Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
[p]As thou hast power and person.
"
"This but done,
[p]Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
[p]For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
[p]As words to little purpose.
"
"Prithee now,
[p]Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
[p]Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
[p]Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
"
"I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
[p]You make strong party, or defend yourself
[p]By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
"
"Only fair speech.
"
"I think 'twill serve, if he
[p]Can thereto frame his spirit.
"
"He must, and will
[p]Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
"
"Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
[p]Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
[p]A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
[p]Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
[p]This mould of CORIOLANUS, they to dust should grind it
[p]And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
[p]You have put me now to such a part which never
[p]I shall discharge to the life.
"
"Come, come, we'll prompt you.
"
"I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
[p]My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
[p]To have my praise for this, perform a part
[p]Thou hast not done before.
"
"Well, I must do't:
[p]Away, my disposition, and possess me
[p]Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
[p]Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
[p]Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
[p]That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
[p]Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
[p]The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
[p]Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
[p]Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
[p]That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
[p]Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
[p]And by my body's action teach my mind
[p]A most inherent baseness.
"
"At thy choice, then:
[p]To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
[p]Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
[p]Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
[p]Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
[p]With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
[p]Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
[p]But owe thy pride thyself.
"
"Pray, be content:
[p]Mother, I am going to the market-place;
[p]Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
[p]Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
[p]Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
[p]Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
[p]Or never trust to what my tongue can do
[p]I' the way of flattery further.
"
"Do your will.
"
"Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
[p]To answer mildly; for they are prepared
[p]With accusations, as I hear, more strong
[p]Than are upon you yet.
"
"The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
[p]Let them accuse me by invention, I
[p]Will answer in mine honour.
"
"Ay, but mildly.
"
"Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
"
"In this point charge him home, that he affects
[p]Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
[p]Enforce him with his envy to the people,
[p]And that the spoil got on the Antiates
[p]Was ne'er distributed.
[p][Enter an AEdile]
[p]What, will he come?
"
"He's coming.
"
"How accompanied?
"
"With old Menenius, and those senators
[p]That always favour'd him.
"
"Have you a catalogue
[p]Of all the voices that we have procured
[p]Set down by the poll?
"
"I have; 'tis ready.
"
"Have you collected them by tribes?
"
"I have.
"
"Assemble presently the people hither;
[p]And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
[p]I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
[p]For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
[p]If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
[p]Insisting on the old prerogative
[p]And power i' the truth o' the cause.
"
"I shall inform them.
"
"And when such time they have begun to cry,
[p]Let them not cease, but with a din confused
[p]Enforce the present execution
[p]Of what we chance to sentence.
"
"Very well.
"
"Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
[p]When we shall hap to give 't them.
"
"Go about it.
[p][Exit AEdile]
[p]Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
[p]Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
[p]Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
[p]Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
[p]What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
[p]With us to break his neck.
"
"Well, here he comes.
[p][Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS,]
[p]with Senators and Patricians]
"
"Calmly, I do beseech you.
"
"Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
[p]Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
[p]Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
[p]Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
[p]Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
[p]And not our streets with war!
"
"Amen, amen.
"
"A noble wish.
"
"Draw near, ye people.
"
"List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!
"
"First, hear me speak.
"
"Well, say. Peace, ho!
"
"Shall I be charged no further than this present?
[p]Must all determine here?
"
"I do demand,
[p]If you submit you to the people's voices,
[p]Allow their officers and are content
[p]To suffer lawful censure for such faults
[p]As shall be proved upon you?
"
"I am content.
"
"Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
[p]The warlike service he has done, consider; think
[p]Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
[p]Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
"
"Scratches with briers,
[p]Scars to move laughter only.
"
"Consider further,
[p]That when he speaks not like a citizen,
[p]You find him like a soldier: do not take
[p]His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
[p]But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
[p]Rather than envy you.
"
"Well, well, no more.
"
"What is the matter
[p]That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
[p]I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
[p]You take it off again?
"
"Answer to us.
"
"Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.
"
"We charge you, that you have contrived to take
[p]From Rome all season'd office and to wind
[p]Yourself into a power tyrannical;
[p]For which you are a traitor to the people.
"
"How! traitor!
"
"Nay, temperately; your promise.
"
"The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
[p]Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
[p]Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
[p]In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
[p]Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
[p]'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
[p]As I do pray the gods.
"
"Mark you this, people?
"
"To the rock, to the rock with him!
"
"Peace!
[p]We need not put new matter to his charge:
[p]What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
[p]Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
[p]Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
[p]Those whose great power must try him; even this,
[p]So criminal and in such capital kind,
[p]Deserves the extremest death.
"
"But since he hath
[p]Served well for Rome,--
"
"What do you prate of service?
"
"I talk of that, that know it.
"
"You?
"
"Is this the promise that you made your mother?
"
"Know, I pray you,--
"
"I know no further:
[p]Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
[p]Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
[p]But with a grain a day, I would not buy
[p]Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
[p]Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
[p]To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
"
"For that he has,
[p]As much as in him lies, from time to time
[p]Envied against the people, seeking means
[p]To pluck away their power, as now at last
[p]Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
[p]Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
[p]That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
[p]And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
[p]Even from this instant, banish him our city,
[p]In peril of precipitation
[p]From off the rock Tarpeian never more
[p]To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
[p]I say it shall be so.
"
"It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
[p]He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
"
"Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--
"
"He's sentenced; no more hearing.
"
"Let me speak:
[p]I have been consul, and can show for Rome
[p]Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
[p]My country's good with a respect more tender,
[p]More holy and profound, than mine own life,
[p]My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
[p]And treasure of my loins; then if I would
[p]Speak that,--
"
"We know your drift: speak what?
"
"There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
[p]As enemy to the people and his country:
[p]It shall be so.
"
"It shall be so, it shall be so.
"
"You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
[p]As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
[p]As the dead carcasses of unburied men
[p]That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
[p]And here remain with your uncertainty!
[p]Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
[p]Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
[p]Fan you into despair! Have the power still
[p]To banish your defenders; till at length
[p]Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
[p]Making not reservation of yourselves,
[p]Still your own foes, deliver you as most
[p]Abated captives to some nation
[p]That won you without blows! Despising,
[p]For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
[p]There is a world elsewhere.
[p][Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, MENENIUS, Senators,]
[p]and Patricians]
"
"The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
"
"Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
"
"Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
[p]As he hath followed you, with all despite;
[p]Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
[p]Attend us through the city.
"
"Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
[p]The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.
"
"Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
[p]With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
[p]Where is your ancient courage? you were used
[p]To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
[p]That common chances common men could bear;
[p]That when the sea was calm all boats alike
[p]Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
[p]When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
[p]A noble cunning: you were used to load me
[p]With precepts that would make invincible
[p]The heart that conn'd them.
"
"O heavens! O heavens!
"
"Nay! prithee, woman,--
"
"Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
[p]And occupations perish!
"
"What, what, what!
[p]I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
[p]Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
[p]If you had been the wife of Hercules,
[p]Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
[p]Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
[p]Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
[p]I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
[p]Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
[p]And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
[p]I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
[p]Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
[p]'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
[p]As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
[p]My hazards still have been your solace: and
[p]Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
[p]Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
[p]Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
[p]Will or exceed the common or be caught
[p]With cautelous baits and practise.
"
"My first son.
[p]Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
[p]With thee awhile: determine on some course,
[p]More than a wild exposture to each chance
[p]That starts i' the way before thee.
"
"O the gods!
"
"I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
[p]Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
[p]And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
[p]A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
[p]O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
[p]And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
[p]I' the absence of the needer.
"
"Fare ye well:
[p]Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
[p]Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
[p]That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
[p]Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
[p]My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
[p]Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
[p]While I remain above the ground, you shall
[p]Hear from me still, and never of me aught
[p]But what is like me formerly.
"
"That's worthily
[p]As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
[p]If I could shake off but one seven years
[p]From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
[p]I'ld with thee every foot.
"
"Give me thy hand: Come.
"
"Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
[p]The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
[p]In his behalf.
"
"Now we have shown our power,
[p]Let us seem humbler after it is done
[p]Than when it was a-doing.
"
"Bid them home:
[p]Say their great enemy is gone, and they
[p]Stand in their ancient strength.
"
"Dismiss them home.
[p][Exit AEdile]
[p]Here comes his mother.
"
"Let's not meet her.
"
"Why?
"
"They say she's mad.
"
"They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
"
"O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
[p]Requite your love!
"
"Peace, peace; be not so loud.
"
"If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
[p]Nay, and you shall hear some.
[p][To BRUTUS]
[p]Will you be gone?
"
"[To SICINIUS] You shall stay too: I would I had the power
[p]To say so to my husband.
"
"Are you mankind?
"
"Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
[p]Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
[p]To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
[p]Than thou hast spoken words?
"
"O blessed heavens!
"
"More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
[p]And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
[p]Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
[p]Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
[p]His good sword in his hand.
"
"What then?
"
"What then!
[p]He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
"
"Bastards and all.
[p]Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
"
"Come, come, peace.
"
"I would he had continued to his country
[p]As he began, and not unknit himself
[p]The noble knot he made.
"
"I would he had.
"
"'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
[p]Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
[p]As I can of those mysteries which heaven
[p]Will not have earth to know.
"
"Pray, let us go.
"
"Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
[p]You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
[p]As far as doth the Capitol exceed
[p]The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
[p]This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
[p]Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.
"
"Well, well, we'll leave you.
"
"Why stay we to be baited
[p]With one that wants her wits?
"
"Take my prayers with you.
[p][Exeunt Tribunes]
[p]I would the gods had nothing else to do
[p]But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
[p]But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
[p]Of what lies heavy to't.
"
"You have told them home;
[p]And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
"
"Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
[p]And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
[p]Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
[p]In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

"Fie, fie, fie!

"I know you well, sir, and you know
[p]me: your name, I think, is Adrian.
"
"It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.
"
"I am a Roman; and my services are,
[p]as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?
"
"Nicanor? no.
"
"The same, sir.
"
"You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
[p]favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
[p]news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
[p]to find you out there: you have well saved me a
[p]day's journey.
"
"There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
[p]people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
"
"Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
[p]so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
[p]hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
"
"The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
[p]would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
[p]so to heart the banishment of that worthy
[p]Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
[p]all power from the people and to pluck from them
[p]their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
[p]tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
[p]breaking out.
"
"Coriolanus banished!
"
"Banished, sir.
"
"You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
"
"The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
[p]said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
[p]when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
[p]Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
[p]great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
[p]of his country.
"
"He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
[p]accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
[p]business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
"
"I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
[p]strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
[p]their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
"
"A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
[p]distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
[p]and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
"
"I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
[p]man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
[p]So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
"
"You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
[p]to be glad of yours.
"
"Well, let us go together.
"
"A goodly city is this Antium. City,
[p]'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
[p]Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
[p]Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
[p]Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
[p]In puny battle slay me.
[p][Enter a Citizen]
[p]Save you, sir.
"
"And you.
"
"Direct me, if it be your will,
[p]Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?
"
"He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
[p]At his house this night.
"
"Which is his house, beseech you?
"
"This, here before you.
"
"Thank you, sir: farewell.
[p][Exit Citizen]
[p]O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
[p]Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
[p]Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
[p]Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
[p]Unseparable, shall within this hour,
[p]On a dissension of a doit, break out
[p]To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
[p]Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
[p]To take the one the other, by some chance,
[p]Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
[p]And interjoin their issues. So with me:
[p]My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
[p]This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
[p]He does fair justice; if he give me way,
[p]I'll do his country service.
"
"Wine, wine, wine! What service
[p]is here! I think our fellows are asleep.
"
"Where's Cotus? my master calls
[p]for him. Cotus!
"
"A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
[p]Appear not like a guest.
"
"What would you have, friend? whence are you?
[p]Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
"
"I have deserved no better entertainment,
[p]In being Coriolanus.
"
"Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
[p]head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
[p]Pray, get you out.
"
"Away!
"
"Away! get you away.
"
"Now thou'rt troublesome.
"
"Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
"
"What fellow's this?
"
"A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
[p]out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.
"
"What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
[p]the house.
"
"Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
"
"What are you?
"
"A gentleman.
"
"A marvellous poor one.
"
"True, so I am.
"
"Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
[p]station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.
"
"Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
"
"What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
[p]strange guest he has here.
"
"And I shall.
"
"Where dwellest thou?
"
"Under the canopy.
"
"Under the canopy!
"
"Ay.
"
"Where's that?
"
"I' the city of kites and crows.
"
"I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
[p]Then thou dwellest with daws too?
"
"No, I serve not thy master.
"
"How, sir! do you meddle with my master?
"
"Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
[p]mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
[p]trencher, hence!
"
"Where is this fellow?
"
"Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
[p]disturbing the lords within.
"
"Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
[p]Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
"
"If, Tullus,
[p][Unmuffling]
[p]Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
[p]Think me for the man I am, necessity
[p]Commands me name myself.
"
"What is thy name?
"
"A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
[p]And harsh in sound to thine.
"
"Say, what's thy name?
[p]Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
[p]Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
[p]Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
"
"Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
[p]thou me yet?
"
"I know thee not: thy name?
"
"My name is Caius CORIOLANUS, who hath done
[p]To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
[p]Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
[p]My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
[p]The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
[p]Shed for my thankless country are requited
[p]But with that surname; a good memory,
[p]And witness of the malice and displeasure
[p]Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
[p]The cruelty and envy of the people,
[p]Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
[p]Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
[p]And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
[p]Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
[p]Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
[p]Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
[p]I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
[p]I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
[p]To be full quit of those my banishers,
[p]Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
[p]A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
[p]Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
[p]Of shame seen through thy country, speed
[p]thee straight,
[p]And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
[p]That my revengeful services may prove
[p]As benefits to thee, for I will fight
[p]Against my canker'd country with the spleen
[p]Of all the under fiends. But if so be
[p]Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
[p]Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
[p]Longer to live most weary, and present
[p]My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
[p]Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
[p]Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
[p]Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
[p]And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
[p]It be to do thee service.
"
"O CORIOLANUS, CORIOLANUS!
[p]Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
[p]A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
[p]Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
[p]And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
[p]Than thee, all noble CORIOLANUS. Let me twine
[p]Mine arms about that body, where against
[p]My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
[p]And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
[p]The anvil of my sword, and do contest
[p]As hotly and as nobly with thy love
[p]As ever in ambitious strength I did
[p]Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
[p]I loved the maid I married; never man
[p]Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
[p]Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
[p]Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
[p]Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
[p]We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
[p]Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
[p]Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
[p]Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
[p]Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
[p]We have been down together in my sleep,
[p]Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
[p]And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy CORIOLANUS,
[p]Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
[p]Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
[p]From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
[p]Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
[p]Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
[p]And take our friendly senators by the hands;
[p]Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
[p]Who am prepared against your territories,
[p]Though not for Rome itself.
"
"You bless me, gods!
"
"Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
[p]The leading of thine own revenges, take
[p]The one half of my commission; and set down--
[p]As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
[p]Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
[p]Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
[p]Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
[p]To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
[p]Let me commend thee first to those that shall
[p]Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
[p]And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
[p]Yet, CORIOLANUS, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
[p][Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two]
[p]Servingmen come forward]
"
"Here's a strange alteration!
"
"By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
[p]a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
[p]false report of him.
"
"What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
[p]finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
"
"Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
[p]him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
[p]cannot tell how to term it.
"
"He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
[p]but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
"
"So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
[p]man i' the world.
"
"I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
"
"Who, my master?
"
"Nay, it's no matter for that.
"
"Worth six on him.
"
"Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
[p]greater soldier.
"
"Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
[p]for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.
"
"Ay, and for an assault too.
"
"O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
"
"[together] What, what, what? let's partake.
"
"[together] What, what, what? let's partake.
"
"I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
[p]lieve be a condemned man.
"
"[together] Wherefore? wherefore?
"
"[together] wherefore?
"
"Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
[p]Caius CORIOLANUS.
"
"Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
"
"I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
[p]good enough for him.
"
"Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
[p]hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
"
"He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
[p]on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
[p]him like a carbon ado.
"
"An he had been cannibally given, he might have
[p]broiled and eaten him too.
"
"But, more of thy news?
"
"Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
[p]and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
[p]question asked him by any of the senators, but they
[p]stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
[p]mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
[p]turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
[p]the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
[p]the middle and but one half of what he was
[p]yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
[p]and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
[p]and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
[p]will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.
"
"And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
"
"Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
[p]many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
[p]were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
[p]we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.
"
"Directitude! what's that?
"
"But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
[p]and the man in blood, they will out of their
[p]burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
[p]him.
"
"But when goes this forward?
"
"To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
[p]drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
[p]parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
[p]wipe their lips.
"
"Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
[p]This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
[p]tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
"
"Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
[p]day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
[p]full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
[p]mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
[p]bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
"
"'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
[p]be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
[p]great maker of cuckolds.
"
"Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
"
"Reason; because they then less need one another.
[p]The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
[p]as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
"
"In, in, in, in!
"
"We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
[p]His remedies are tame i' the present peace
[p]And quietness of the people, which before
[p]Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
[p]Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
[p]Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
[p]Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
[p]Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
[p]About their functions friendly.
"
"We stood to't in good time.
[p][Enter MENENIUS]
[p]Is this Menenius?
"
"'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.
"
"Hail sir!
"
"Hail to you both!
"
"Your Coriolanus
[p]Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
[p]The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
[p]Were he more angry at it.
"
"All's well; and might have been much better, if
[p]He could have temporized.
"
"Where is he, hear you?
"
"Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
[p]Hear nothing from him.
"
"The gods preserve you both!
"
"God-den, our neighbours.
"
"God-den to you all, god-den to you all.
"
"Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
[p]Are bound to pray for you both.
"
"Live, and thrive!
"
"Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
[p]Had loved you as we did.
"
"Now the gods keep you!
"
"Farewell, farewell.
"
"This is a happier and more comely time
[p]Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
[p]Crying confusion.
"
"Caius CORIOLANUS was
[p]A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
[p]O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
[p]Self-loving,--
"
"And affecting one sole throne,
[p]Without assistance.
"
"I think not so.
"
"We should by this, to all our lamentation,
[p]If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
"
"The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
[p]Sits safe and still without him.
"
"Worthy tribunes,
[p]There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
[p]Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
[p]Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
[p]And with the deepest malice of the war
[p]Destroy what lies before 'em.
"
"'Tis Aufidius,
[p]Who, hearing of our CORIOLANUS' banishment,
[p]Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
[p]Which were inshell'd when CORIOLANUS stood for Rome,
[p]And durst not once peep out.
"
"Come, what talk you
[p]Of CORIOLANUS?
"
"Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
[p]The Volsces dare break with us.
"
"Cannot be!
[p]We have record that very well it can,
[p]And three examples of the like have been
[p]Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
[p]Before you punish him, where he heard this,
[p]Lest you shall chance to whip your information
[p]And beat the messenger who bids beware
[p]Of what is to be dreaded.
"
"Tell not me:
[p]I know this cannot be.
"
"Not possible.
"
"The nobles in great earnestness are going
[p]All to the senate-house: some news is come
[p]That turns their countenances.
"
"'Tis this slave;--
[p]Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
[p]Nothing but his report.
"
"Yes, worthy sir,
[p]The slave's report is seconded; and more,
[p]More fearful, is deliver'd.
"
"What more fearful?
"
"It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
[p]How probable I do not know--that CORIOLANUS,
[p]Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
[p]And vows revenge as spacious as between
[p]The young'st and oldest thing.
"
"This is most likely!
"
"Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
[p]Good CORIOLANUS home again.
"
"The very trick on't.
"
"This is unlikely:
[p]He and Aufidius can no more atone
[p]Than violentest contrariety.
"
"You are sent for to the senate:
[p]A fearful army, led by Caius CORIOLANUS
[p]Associated with Aufidius, rages
[p]Upon our territories; and have already
[p]O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
[p]What lay before them.
"
"O, you have made good work!
"
"What news? what news?
"
"You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
[p]To melt the city leads upon your pates,
[p]To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--
"
"What's the news? what's the news?
"
"Your temples burned in their cement, and
[p]Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
[p]Into an auger's bore.
"
"Pray now, your news?
[p]You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
[p]If CORIOLANUS should be join'd with Volscians,--
"
"If!
[p]He is their god: he leads them like a thing
[p]Made by some other deity than nature,
[p]That shapes man better; and they follow him,
[p]Against us brats, with no less confidence
[p]Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
[p]Or butchers killing flies.
"
"You have made good work,
[p]You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
[p]on the voice of occupation and
[p]The breath of garlic-eaters!
"
"He will shake
[p]Your Rome about your ears.
"
"As Hercules
[p]Did shake down mellow fruit.
[p]You have made fair work!
"
"But is this true, sir?
"
"Ay; and you'll look pale
[p]Before you find it other. All the regions
[p]Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
[p]Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
[p]And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
[p]Your enemies and his find something in him.
"
"We are all undone, unless
[p]The noble man have mercy.
"
"Who shall ask it?
[p]The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
[p]Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
[p]Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
[p]Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
[p]As those should do that had deserved his hate,
[p]And therein show'd like enemies.
"
"'Tis true:
[p]If he were putting to my house the brand
[p]That should consume it, I have not the face
[p]To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
[p]You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
"
"You have brought
[p]A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
[p]So incapable of help.
"
"Say not we brought it.
"
"How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
[p]And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
[p]Who did hoot him out o' the city.
"
"But I fear
[p]They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
[p]The second name of men, obeys his points
[p]As if he were his officer: desperation
[p]Is all the policy, strength and defence,
[p]That Rome can make against them.
"
"Here come the clusters.
[p]And is Aufidius with him? You are they
[p]That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
[p]Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
[p]Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
[p]And not a hair upon a soldier's head
[p]Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
[p]As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
[p]And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
[p]if he could burn us all into one coal,
[p]We have deserved it.
"
"Faith, we hear fearful news.
"
"For mine own part,
[p]When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
"
"And so did I.
"
"And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
[p]many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
[p]though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
[p]it was against our will.
"
"Ye re goodly things, you voices!
"
"You have made
[p]Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
"
"O, ay, what else?
"
"Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
[p]These are a side that would be glad to have
[p]This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
[p]And show no sign of fear.
"
"The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
[p]I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
[p]him.
"
"So did we all. But, come, let's home.
"
"I do not like this news.
"
"Nor I.
"
"Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
[p]Would buy this for a lie!
"
"Pray, let us go.
"
"Do they still fly to the Roman?
"
"I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
[p]Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
[p]Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
[p]And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
[p]Even by your own.
"
"I cannot help it now,
[p]Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
[p]Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
[p]Even to my person, than I thought he would
[p]When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
[p]In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
[p]What cannot be amended.
"
"Yet I wish, sir,--
[p]I mean for your particular,--you had not
[p]Join'd in commission with him; but either
[p]Had borne the action of yourself, or else
[p]To him had left it solely.
"
"I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
[p]when he shall come to his account, he knows not
[p]What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
[p]And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
[p]To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
[p]And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
[p]Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
[p]As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
[p]That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
[p]Whene'er we come to our account.
"
"Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
"
"All places yield to him ere he sits down;
[p]And the nobility of Rome are his:
[p]The senators and patricians love him too:
[p]The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
[p]Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
[p]To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
[p]As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
[p]By sovereignty of nature. First he was
[p]A noble servant to them; but he could not
[p]Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
[p]Which out of daily fortune ever taints
[p]The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
[p]To fail in the disposing of those chances
[p]Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
[p]Not to be other than one thing, not moving
[p]From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
[p]Even with the same austerity and garb
[p]As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
[p]As he hath spices of them all, not all,
[p]For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
[p]So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
[p]To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
[p]Lie in the interpretation of the time:
[p]And power, unto itself most commendable,
[p]Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
[p]To extol what it hath done.
[p]One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
[p]Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
[p]Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
[p]Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
"
"No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
[p]Which was sometime his general; who loved him
[p]In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
[p]But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
[p]A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
[p]The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
[p]To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
"
"He would not seem to know me.
"
"Do you hear?
"
"Yet one time he did call me by my name:
[p]I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
[p]That we have bled together. Coriolanus
[p]He would not answer to: forbad all names;
[p]He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
[p]Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
[p]Of burning Rome.
"
"Why, so: you have made good work!
[p]A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
[p]To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
"
"I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
[p]When it was less expected: he replied,
[p]It was a bare petition of a state
[p]To one whom they had punish'd.
"
"Very well:
[p]Could he say less?
"
"I offer'd to awaken his regard
[p]For's private friends: his answer to me was,
[p]He could not stay to pick them in a pile
[p]Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
[p]For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
[p]And still to nose the offence.
"
"For one poor grain or two!
[p]I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
[p]And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
[p]You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
[p]Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
"
"Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
[p]In this so never-needed help, yet do not
[p]Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
[p]Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
[p]More than the instant army we can make,
[p]Might stop our countryman.
"
"No, I'll not meddle.
"
"Pray you, go to him.
"
"What should I do?
"
"Only make trial what your love can do
[p]For Rome, towards CORIOLANUS.
"
"Well, and say that CORIOLANUS
[p]Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
[p]Unheard; what then?
[p]But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
[p]With his unkindness? say't be so?
"
"Yet your good will
[p]must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
[p]As you intended well.
"
"I'll undertake 't:
[p]I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
[p]And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
[p]He was not taken well; he had not dined:
[p]The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
[p]We pout upon the morning, are unapt
[p]To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
[p]These and these conveyances of our blood
[p]With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
[p]Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
[p]Till he be dieted to my request,
[p]And then I'll set upon him.
"
"You know the very road into his kindness,
[p]And cannot lose your way.
"
"Good faith, I'll prove him,
[p]Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
[p]Of my success.
"
"He'll never hear him.
"
"Not?
"
"I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
[p]Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
[p]The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
[p]'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
[p]Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
[p]He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
[p]Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
[p]So that all hope is vain.
[p]Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
[p]Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
[p]For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
[p]And with our fair entreaties haste them on.
"
"Stay: whence are you?
"
"Stand, and go back.
"
"You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
[p]I am an officer of state, and come
[p]To speak with Coriolanus.
"
"From whence?
"
"From Rome.
"
"You may not pass, you must return: our general
[p]Will no more hear from thence.
"
"You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
[p]You'll speak with Coriolanus.
"
"Good my friends,
[p]If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
[p]And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
[p]My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
"
"Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
[p]Is not here passable.
"
"I tell thee, fellow,
[p]The general is my lover: I have been
[p]The book of his good acts, whence men have read
[p]His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
[p]For I have ever verified my friends,
[p]Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
[p]Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
[p]Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
[p]I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
[p]Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
[p]I must have leave to pass.
"
"Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
[p]behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
[p]should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
[p]to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.
"
"Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
[p]always factionary on the party of your general.
"
"Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
[p]have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
[p]say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.
"
"Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
[p]speak with him till after dinner.
"
"You are a Roman, are you?
"
"I am, as thy general is.
"
"Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
[p]when you have pushed out your gates the very
[p]defender of them, and, in a violent popular
[p]ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
[p]front his revenges with the easy groans of old
[p]women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
[p]the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
[p]you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
[p]intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
[p]such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
[p]therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
[p]execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
[p]you out of reprieve and pardon.
"
"Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
[p]use me with estimation.
"
"Come, my captain knows you not.
"
"I mean, thy general.
"
"My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
[p]I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
[p]the utmost of your having: back.
"
"Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--
"
"What's the matter?
"
"Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
[p]You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
[p]perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
[p]my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
[p]with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
[p]hanging, or of some death more long in
[p]spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
[p]presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
[p][To CORIOLANUS]
[p]The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
[p]particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
[p]thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
[p]thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
[p]water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
[p]thee; but being assured none but myself could move
[p]thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
[p]sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
[p]petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
[p]wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
[p]here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
[p]access to thee.
"
"Away!
"
"How! away!
"
"Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
[p]Are servanted to others: though I owe
[p]My revenge properly, my remission lies
[p]In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
[p]Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
[p]Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
[p]Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
[p]Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
[p]Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
[p][Gives a letter]
[p]And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
[p]I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
[p]Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
"
"You keep a constant temper.
"
"Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
"
"'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
[p]way home again.
"
"Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
[p]greatness back?
"
"What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
"
"I neither care for the world nor your general: for
[p]such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
[p]ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
[p]himself fears it not from another: let your general
[p]do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
[p]your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
[p]as I was said to, Away!
"
"A noble fellow, I warrant him.
"
"The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
[p]oak not to be wind-shaken.
"
"We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
[p]Set down our host. My partner in this action,
[p]You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
[p]I have borne this business.
"
"Only their ends
[p]You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
[p]The general suit of Rome; never admitted
[p]A private whisper, no, not with such friends
[p]That thought them sure of you.
"
"This last old man,
[p]Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
[p]Loved me above the measure of a father;
[p]Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
[p]Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
[p]Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
[p]The first conditions, which they did refuse
[p]And cannot now accept; to grace him only
[p]That thought he could do more, a very little
[p]I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
[p]Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
[p]Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
[p][Shout within]
[p]Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
[p]In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
[p][Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA,]
[p]leading young CORIOLANUS, VALERIA, and Attendants]
[p]My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
[p]Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
[p]The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
[p]All bond and privilege of nature, break!
[p]Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
[p]What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
[p]Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
[p]Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
[p]As if Olympus to a molehill should
[p]In supplication nod: and my young boy
[p]Hath an aspect of intercession, which
[p]Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
[p]Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
[p]Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
[p]As if a man were author of himself
[p]And knew no other kin.
"
"My lord and husband!
"
"These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
"
"The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
[p]Makes you think so.
"
"Like a dull actor now,
[p]I have forgot my part, and I am out,
[p]Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
[p]Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
[p]For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
[p]Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
[p]Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
[p]I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
[p]Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
[p]And the most noble mother of the world
[p]Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
[p][Kneels]
[p]Of thy deep duty more impression show
[p]Than that of common sons.
"
"O, stand up blest!
[p]Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
[p]I kneel before thee; and unproperly
[p]Show duty, as mistaken all this while
[p]Between the child and parent.
"
"What is this?
[p]Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
[p]Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
[p]Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
[p]Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
[p]Murdering impossibility, to make
[p]What cannot be, slight work.
"
"Thou art my warrior;
[p]I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
"
"The noble sister of Publicola,
[p]The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
[p]That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
[p]And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
"
"This is a poor epitome of yours,
[p]Which by the interpretation of full time
[p]May show like all yourself.
"
"The god of soldiers,
[p]With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
[p]Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
[p]To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
[p]Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
[p]And saving those that eye thee!
"
"Your knee, sirrah.
"
"That's my brave boy!
"
"Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
[p]Are suitors to you.
"
"I beseech you, peace:
[p]Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
[p]The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
[p]Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
[p]Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
[p]Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
[p]Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
[p]To ally my rages and revenges with
[p]Your colder reasons.
"
"O, no more, no more!
[p]You have said you will not grant us any thing;
[p]For we have nothing else to ask, but that
[p]Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
[p]That, if you fail in our request, the blame
[p]May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
"
"Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
[p]Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
"
"Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
[p]And state of bodies would bewray what life
[p]We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
[p]How more unfortunate than all living women
[p]Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
[p]which should
[p]Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
[p]with comforts,
[p]Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
[p]Making the mother, wife and child to see
[p]The son, the husband and the father tearing
[p]His country's bowels out. And to poor we
[p]Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
[p]Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
[p]That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
[p]Alas, how can we for our country pray.
[p]Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
[p]Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
[p]The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
[p]Our comfort in the country. We must find
[p]An evident calamity, though we had
[p]Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
[p]Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
[p]With manacles thorough our streets, or else
[p]triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
[p]And bear the palm for having bravely shed
[p]Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
[p]I purpose not to wait on fortune till
[p]These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
[p]Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
[p]Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
[p]March to assault thy country than to tread--
[p]Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
[p]That brought thee to this world.
"
"Ay, and mine,
[p]That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
[p]Living to time.
"
"A' shall not tread on me;
[p]I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
"
"Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
[p]Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
[p]I have sat too long.
"
"Nay, go not from us thus.
[p]If it were so that our request did tend
[p]To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
[p]The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
[p]As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
[p]Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
[p]May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
[p]'This we received;' and each in either side
[p]Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
[p]For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
[p]The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
[p]That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
[p]Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
[p]Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
[p]Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
[p]But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
[p]Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
[p]To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
[p]Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
[p]To imitate the graces of the gods;
[p]To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
[p]And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
[p]That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
[p]Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
[p]Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
[p]He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
[p]Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
[p]Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
[p]More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
[p]Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
[p]Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
[p]When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
[p]Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
[p]Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
[p]And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
[p]Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
[p]That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
[p]To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
[p]Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
[p]To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
[p]Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
[p]This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
[p]And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
[p]This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
[p]But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
[p]Does reason our petition with more strength
[p]Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
[p]This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
[p]His wife is in Corioli and his child
[p]Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
[p]I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
[p]And then I'll speak a little.
"
"O mother, mother!
[p]What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
[p]The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
[p]They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
[p]You have won a happy victory to Rome;
[p]But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
[p]Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
[p]If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
[p]Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
[p]I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
[p]Were you in my stead, would you have heard
[p]A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?
"
"I was moved withal.
"
"I dare be sworn you were:
[p]And, sir, it is no little thing to make
[p]Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
[p]What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
[p]I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
[p]Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
"
"[Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
[p]thy honour
[p]At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
[p]Myself a former fortune.
"
"Ay, by and by;
[p][To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, &c]
[p]But we will drink together; and you shall bear
[p]A better witness back than words, which we,
[p]On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
[p]Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
[p]To have a temple built you: all the swords
[p]In Italy, and her confederate arms,
[p]Could not have made this peace.
"
"See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
[p]corner-stone?
"
"Why, what of that?
"
"If it be possible for you to displace it with your
[p]little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
[p]Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
[p]But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
[p]sentenced and stay upon execution.
"
"Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
[p]condition of a man!
"
"There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
[p]yet your butterfly was a grub. This CORIOLANUS is grown
[p]from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
[p]creeping thing.
"
"He loved his mother dearly.
"
"So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
[p]now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
[p]of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
[p]moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
[p]his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
[p]his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
[p]battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
[p]Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
[p]his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
[p]and a heaven to throne in.
"
"Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
"
"I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
[p]mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
[p]in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
[p]shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
[p]you.
"
"The gods be good unto us!
"
"No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
[p]us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
[p]and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.
"
"Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
[p]The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
[p]And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
[p]The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
[p]They'll give him death by inches.
"
"What's the news?
"
"Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
[p]The Volscians are dislodged, and CORIOLANUS gone:
[p]A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
[p]No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
"
"Friend,
[p]Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
"
"As certain as I know the sun is fire:
[p]Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
[p]Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
[p]As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
[p][Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together]
[p]The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
[p]Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
[p]Make the sun dance. Hark you!
"
"This is good news:
[p]I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
[p]Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
[p]A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
[p]A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
[p]This morning for ten thousand of your throats
[p]I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
"
"First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
[p]Accept my thankfulness.
"
"Sir, we have all
[p]Great cause to give great thanks.
"
"They are near the city?
"
"Almost at point to enter.
"
"We will meet them,
[p]And help the joy.
"
"Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
[p]Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
[p]And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
[p]Unshout the noise that banish'd CORIOLANUS,
[p]Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
[p]Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
"
"Welcome, ladies, Welcome!
"
"Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
[p]Deliver them this paper: having read it,
[p]Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
[p]Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
[p]Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
[p]The city ports by this hath enter'd and
[p]Intends to appear before the people, hoping
[p]To purge herself with words: dispatch.
[p][Exeunt Attendants]
[p][Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction]
[p]Most welcome!
"
"How is it with our general?
"
"Even so
[p]As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
[p]And with his charity slain.
"
"Most noble sir,
[p]If you do hold the same intent wherein
[p]You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
[p]Of your great danger.
"
"Sir, I cannot tell:
[p]We must proceed as we do find the people.
"
"The people will remain uncertain whilst
[p]'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
[p]Makes the survivor heir of all.
"
"I know it;
[p]And my pretext to strike at him admits
[p]A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
[p]Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
[p]He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
[p]Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
[p]He bow'd his nature, never known before
[p]But to be rough, unswayable and free.
"
"Sir, his stoutness
[p]When he did stand for consul, which he lost
[p]By lack of stooping,--
"
"That I would have spoke of:
[p]Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
[p]Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
[p]Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
[p]In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
[p]Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
[p]My best and freshest men; served his designments
[p]In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
[p]Which he did end all his; and took some pride
[p]To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
[p]I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
[p]He waged me with his countenance, as if
[p]I had been mercenary.
"
"So he did, my lord:
[p]The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
[p]When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
[p]For no less spoil than glory,--
"
"There was it:
[p]For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
[p]At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
[p]As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
[p]Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
[p]And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
[p][Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of]
[p]the People]
"
"Your native town you enter'd like a post,
[p]And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
[p]Splitting the air with noise.
"
"And patient fools,
[p]Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
[p]With giving him glory.
"
"Therefore, at your vantage,
[p]Ere he express himself, or move the people
[p]With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
[p]Which we will second. When he lies along,
[p]After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
[p]His reasons with his body.
"
"Say no more:
[p]Here come the lords.
"
"You are most welcome home.
"
"I have not deserved it.
[p]But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
[p]What I have written to you?
"
"We have.
"
"And grieve to hear't.
[p]What faults he made before the last, I think
[p]Might have found easy fines: but there to end
[p]Where he was to begin and give away
[p]The benefit of our levies, answering us
[p]With our own charge, making a treaty where
[p]There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.
"
"He approaches: you shall hear him.
[p][Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and]
[p]colours; commoners being with him]
"
"Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
[p]No more infected with my country's love
[p]Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
[p]Under your great command. You are to know
[p]That prosperously I have attempted and
[p]With bloody passage led your wars even to
[p]The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
[p]Do more than counterpoise a full third part
[p]The charges of the action. We have made peace
[p]With no less honour to the Antiates
[p]Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
[p]Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
[p]Together with the seal o' the senate, what
[p]We have compounded on.
"
"Read it not, noble lords;
[p]But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
[p]He hath abused your powers.
"
"Traitor! how now!
"
"Ay, traitor, CORIOLANUS!
"
"CORIOLANUS!
"
"Ay, CORIOLANUS, Caius CORIOLANUS: dost thou think
[p]I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
[p]Coriolanus in Corioli?
[p]You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
[p]He has betray'd your business, and given up,
[p]For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
[p]I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
[p]Breaking his oath and resolution like
[p]A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
[p]Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
[p]He whined and roar'd away your victory,
[p]That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
[p]Look'd wondering each at other.
"
"Hear'st thou, Mars?
"
"Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
"
"Ha!
"
"No more.
"
"Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
[p]Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
[p]Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
[p]I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
[p]Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
[p]Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
[p]Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
[p]To thrust the lie unto him.
"
"Peace, both, and hear me speak.
"
"Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
[p]Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
[p]If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
[p]That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
[p]Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
[p]Alone I did it. Boy!
"
"Why, noble lords,
[p]Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
[p]Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
[p]'Fore your own eyes and ears?
"
"Let him die for't.
"
"'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
[p]my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
[p]Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
"
"Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
[p]The man is noble and his fame folds-in
[p]This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
[p]Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
[p]And trouble not the peace.
"
"O that I had him,
[p]With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
[p]To use my lawful sword!
"
"Insolent villain!
"
"Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
[p][The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS:]
[p]AUFIDIUS stands on his body]
"
"Hold, hold, hold, hold!
"
"My noble masters, hear me speak.
"
"O Tullus,--
"
"Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
"
"Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
[p]Put up your swords.
"
"My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
[p]Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
[p]Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
[p]That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
[p]To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
[p]Myself your loyal servant, or endure
[p]Your heaviest censure.
"
"Bear from hence his body;
[p]And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
[p]As the most noble corse that ever herald
[p]Did follow to his urn.
"
"His own impatience
[p]Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
[p]Let's make the best of it.
"
"My rage is gone;
[p]And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
[p]Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
[p]Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
[p]Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
[p]Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
[p]Which to this hour bewail the injury,
[p]Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
"
"You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
[p]No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
[p]Still seem as does the king.
"
"But what's the matter?
"
"His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
[p]He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
[p]That late he married--hath referr'd herself
[p]Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;
[p]Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all
[p]Is outward sorrow; though I think the king
[p]Be touch'd at very heart.
"
"None but the king?
"
"He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
[p]That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
[p]Although they wear their faces to the bent
[p]Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
[p]Glad at the thing they scowl at.
"
"And why so?
"
"He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
[p]Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
[p]I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
[p]And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
[p]As, to seek through the regions of the earth
[p]For one his like, there would be something failing
[p]In him that should compare. I do not think
[p]So fair an outward and such stuff within
[p]Endows a man but he.
"
"You speak him far.
"
"I do extend him, sir, within himself,
[p]Crush him together rather than unfold
[p]His measure duly.
"
"What's his name and birth?
"
"I cannot delve him to the root: his father
[p]Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
[p]Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
[p]But had his titles by Tenantius whom
[p]He served with glory and admired success,
[p]So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
[p]And had, besides this gentleman in question,
[p]Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
[p]Died with their swords in hand; for which
[p]their father,
[p]Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
[p]That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
[p]Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
[p]As he was born. The king he takes the babe
[p]To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
[p]Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
[p]Puts to him all the learnings that his time
[p]Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
[p]As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
[p]And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
[p]Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
[p]A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
[p]A glass that feated them, and to the graver
[p]A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
[p]For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
[p]Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
[p]By her election may be truly read
[p]What kind of man he is.
"
"I honour him
[p]Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
[p]Is she sole child to the king?
"
"His only child.
[p]He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
[p]Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
[p]I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
[p]Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
[p]Which way they went.
"
"How long is this ago?
"
"Some twenty years.
"
"That a king's children should be so convey'd,
[p]So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
[p]That could not trace them!
"
"Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
[p]Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
[p]Yet is it true, sir.
"
"I do well believe you.
"
"We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,
[p]The queen, and princess.
"
"No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
[p]After the slander of most stepmothers,
[p]Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but
[p]Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
[p]That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
[p]So soon as I can win the offended king,
[p]I will be known your advocate: marry, yet
[p]The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
[p]You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
[p]Your wisdom may inform you.
"
"Please your highness,
[p]I will from hence to-day.
"
"You know the peril.
[p]I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
[p]The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
[p]Hath charged you should not speak together.
"
"O
[p]Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
[p]Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
[p]I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--
[p]Always reserved my holy duty--what
[p]His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
[p]And I shall here abide the hourly shot
[p]Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
[p]But that there is this jewel in the world
[p]That I may see again.
"
"My queen! my mistress!
[p]O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
[p]To be suspected of more tenderness
[p]Than doth become a man. I will remain
[p]The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
[p]My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
[p]Who to my father was a friend, to me
[p]Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,
[p]And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
[p]Though ink be made of gall.
"
"Be brief, I pray you:
[p]If the king come, I shall incur I know not
[p]How much of his displeasure.
[p][Aside]
[p]Yet I'll move him
[p]To walk this way: I never do him wrong,
[p]But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
[p]Pays dear for my offences.
"
"Should we be taking leave
[p]As long a term as yet we have to live,
[p]The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
"
"Nay, stay a little:
[p]Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
[p]Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;
[p]This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;
[p]But keep it till you woo another wife,
[p]When Imogen is dead.
"
"How, how! another?
[p]You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
[p]And sear up my embracements from a next
[p]With bonds of death!
[p][Putting on the ring]
[p]Remain, remain thou here
[p]While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
[p]As I my poor self did exchange for you,
[p]To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
[p]I still win of you: for my sake wear this;
[p]It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
[p]Upon this fairest prisoner.
"
"O the gods!
[p]When shall we see again?
"
"Alack, the king!
"
"Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!
[p]If after this command thou fraught the court
[p]With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!
[p]Thou'rt poison to my blood.
"
"The gods protect you!
[p]And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.
"
"There cannot be a pinch in death
[p]More sharp than this is.
"
"O disloyal thing,
[p]That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
[p]A year's age on me.
"
"I beseech you, sir,
[p]Harm not yourself with your vexation
[p]I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
[p]Subdues all pangs, all fears.
"
"Past grace? obedience?
"
"Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.
"
"That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
"
"O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
[p]And did avoid a puttock.
"
"Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
[p]A seat for baseness.
"
"No; I rather added
[p]A lustre to it.
"
"O thou vile one!
"
"Sir,
[p]It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
[p]You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
[p]A man worth any woman, overbuys me
[p]Almost the sum he pays.
"
"What, art thou mad?
"
"Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
[p]A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
[p]Our neighbour shepherd's son!
"
"Thou foolish thing!
[p][Re-enter QUEEN]
[p]They were again together: you have done
[p]Not after our command. Away with her,
[p]And pen her up.
"
"Beseech your patience. Peace,
[p]Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
[p]Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort
[p]Out of your best advice.
"
"Nay, let her languish
[p]A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,
[p]Die of this folly!
"
"Fie! you must give way.
[p][Enter PISANIO]
[p]Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
"
"My lord your son drew on my master.
"
"Ha!
[p]No harm, I trust, is done?
"
"There might have been,
[p]But that my master rather play'd than fought
[p]And had no help of anger: they were parted
[p]By gentlemen at hand.
"
"I am very glad on't.
"
"Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
[p]To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
[p]I would they were in Afric both together;
[p]Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
[p]The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
"
"On his command: he would not suffer me
[p]To bring him to the haven; left these notes
[p]Of what commands I should be subject to,
[p]When 't pleased you to employ me.
"
"This hath been
[p]Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
[p]He will remain so.
"
"I humbly thank your highness.
"
"Pray, walk awhile.
"
"About some half-hour hence,
[p]I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
[p]Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
"
"Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
[p]violence of action hath made you reek as a
[p]sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
[p]there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
"
"If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
"
"[Aside] No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.
"
"Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
[p]not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.
"
"[Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' the
[p]backside the town.
"
"The villain would not stand me.
"
"[Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.
"
"Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
[p]he added to your having; gave you some ground.
"
"[Aside] As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
"
"I would they had not come between us.
"
"[Aside] So would I, till you had measured how long
[p]a fool you were upon the ground.
"
"And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
"
"[Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she
[p]is damned.
"
"Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
[p]go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen
[p]small reflection of her wit.
"
"[Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the
[p]reflection should hurt her.
"
"Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some
[p]hurt done!
"
"[Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall
[p]of an ass, which is no great hurt.
"
"You'll go with us?
"
"I'll attend your lordship.
"
"Nay, come, let's go together.
"
"Well, my lord.
"
"I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
[p]And question'dst every sail: if he should write
[p]And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
[p]As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
[p]That he spake to thee?
"
"It was his queen, his queen!
"
"Then waved his handkerchief?
"
"And kiss'd it, madam.
"
"Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
[p]And that was all?
"
"No, madam; for so long
[p]As he could make me with this eye or ear
[p]Distinguish him from others, he did keep
[p]The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
[p]Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind
[p]Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
[p]How swift his ship.
"
"Thou shouldst have made him
[p]As little as a crow, or less, ere left
[p]To after-eye him.
"
"Madam, so I did.
"
"I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
[p]To look upon him, till the diminution
[p]Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,
[p]Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
[p]The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
[p]Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
[p]When shall we hear from him?
"
"Be assured, madam,
[p]With his next vantage.
"
"I did not take my leave of him, but had
[p]Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
[p]How I would think on him at certain hours
[p]Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
[p]The shes of Italy should not betray
[p]Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
[p]At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
[p]To encounter me with orisons, for then
[p]I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
[p]Give him that parting kiss which I had set
[p]Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
[p]And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
[p]Shakes all our buds from growing.
"
"The queen, madam,
[p]Desires your highness' company.
"
"Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
[p]I will attend the queen.
"
"Madam, I shall.
"
"Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was
[p]then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy
[p]as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I
[p]could then have looked on him without the help of
[p]admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments
[p]had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
"
"You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
[p]he is with that which makes him both without and within.
"
"I have seen him in France: we had very many there
[p]could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
"
"This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein
[p]he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,
[p]words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
"
"And then his banishment.
"
"Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this
[p]lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
[p]to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,
[p]which else an easy battery might lay flat, for
[p]taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
[p]it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
[p]acquaintance?
"
"His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I
[p]have been often bound for no less than my life.
[p]Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
[p]amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your
[p]knowing, to a stranger of his quality.
[p][Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS]
[p]I beseech you all, be better known to this
[p]gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend
[p]of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
[p]hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.
"
"Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
"
"Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
[p]which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
"
"Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I
[p]did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity
[p]you should have been put together with so mortal a
[p]purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
[p]slight and trivial a nature.
"
"By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;
[p]rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
[p]my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
[p]but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
[p]it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.
"
"'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,
[p]and by such two that would by all likelihood have
[p]confounded one the other, or have fallen both.
"
"Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
"
"Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,
[p]which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.
[p]It was much like an argument that fell out last
[p]night, where each of us fell in praise of our
[p]country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
[p]vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
[p]affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,
[p]chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable
[p]than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
"
"That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's
[p]opinion by this worn out.
"
"She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
"
"You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
"
"Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would
[p]abate her nothing, though I profess myself her
[p]adorer, not her friend.
"
"As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
[p]comparison--had been something too fair and too good
[p]for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
[p]I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
[p]many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
[p]excelled many: but I have not seen the most
[p]precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.
"
"I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
"
"What do you esteem it at?
"
"More than the world enjoys.
"
"Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's
[p]outprized by a trifle.
"
"You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if
[p]there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit
[p]for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,
[p]and only the gift of the gods.
"
"Which the gods have given you?
"
"Which, by their graces, I will keep.
"
"You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,
[p]strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
[p]ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
[p]estimations; the one is but frail and the other
[p]casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished
[p]courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
"
"Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
[p]to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the
[p]holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do
[p]nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
[p]notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
"
"Let us leave here, gentlemen.
"
"Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I
[p]thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
"
"With five times so much conversation, I should get
[p]ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even
[p]to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.
"
"No, no.
"
"I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
[p]your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it
[p]something: but I make my wager rather against your
[p]confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your
[p]offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
[p]lady in the world.
"
"You are a great deal abused in too bold a
[p]persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're
[p]worthy of by your attempt.
"
"What's that?
"
"A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,
[p]deserve more; a punishment too.
"
"Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;
[p]let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be
[p]better acquainted.
"
"Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
[p]approbation of what I have spoke!
"
"What lady would you choose to assail?
"
"Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
[p]I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,
[p]that, commend me to the court where your lady is,
[p]with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
[p]second conference, and I will bring from thence
[p]that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
"
"I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring
[p]I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
"
"You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy
[p]ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
[p]preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
[p]religion in you, that you fear.
"
"This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a
[p]graver purpose, I hope.
"
"I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo
[p]what's spoken, I swear.
"
"Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
[p]return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
[p]mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
[p]unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.
"
"I will have it no lay.
"
"By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no
[p]sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
[p]bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
[p]are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,
[p]and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,
[p]she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
[p]yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
[p]free entertainment.
"
"I embrace these conditions; let us have articles
[p]betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if
[p]you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
[p]to understand you have prevailed, I am no further
[p]your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she
[p]remain unseduced, you not making it appear
[p]otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you
[p]have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
[p]your sword.
"
"Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set
[p]down by lawful counsel, and straight away for
[p]Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and
[p]starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two
[p]wagers recorded.
"
"Agreed.
"
"Will this hold, think you?
"
"Signior Iachimo will not from it.
[p]Pray, let us follow 'em.
"
"Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
[p]Make haste: who has the note of them?
"
"I, madam.
"
"Dispatch.
[p][Exeunt Ladies]
[p]Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?
"
"Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:
[p][Presenting a small box]
[p]But I beseech your grace, without offence,--
[p]My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
[p]Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,
[p]Which are the movers of a languishing death;
[p]But though slow, deadly?
"
"I wonder, doctor,
[p]Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
[p]Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
[p]To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
[p]That our great king himself doth woo me oft
[p]For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--
[p]Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
[p]That I did amplify my judgment in
[p]Other conclusions? I will try the forces
[p]Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
[p]We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
[p]To try the vigour of them and apply
[p]Allayments to their act, and by them gather
[p]Their several virtues and effects.
"
"Your highness
[p]Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:
[p]Besides, the seeing these effects will be
[p]Both noisome and infectious.
"
"O, content thee.
[p][Enter PISANIO]
[p][Aside]
[p]Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
[p]Will I first work: he's for his master,
[p]An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!
[p]Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
[p]Take your own way.
"
"[Aside] I do suspect you, madam;
[p]But you shall do no harm.
"
"[To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.
"
"[Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has
[p]Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,
[p]And will not trust one of her malice with
[p]A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
[p]Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
[p]Which first, perchance, she'll prove on
[p]cats and dogs,
[p]Then afterward up higher: but there is
[p]No danger in what show of death it makes,
[p]More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
[p]To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
[p]With a most false effect; and I the truer,
[p]So to be false with her.
"
"No further service, doctor,
[p]Until I send for thee.
"
"I humbly take my leave.
"
"Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
[p]She will not quench and let instructions enter
[p]Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
[p]When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
[p]I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
[p]As great as is thy master, greater, for
[p]His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
[p]Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor
[p]Continue where he is: to shift his being
[p]Is to exchange one misery with another,
[p]And every day that comes comes to decay
[p]A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
[p]To be depender on a thing that leans,
[p]Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
[p]So much as but to prop him?
[p][The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up]
[p]Thou takest up
[p]Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:
[p]It is a thing I made, which hath the king
[p]Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know
[p]What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;
[p]It is an earnest of a further good
[p]That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
[p]The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
[p]Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
[p]Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
[p]Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king
[p]To any shape of thy preferment such
[p]As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
[p]That set thee on to this desert, am bound
[p]To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
[p]Think on my words.
[p][Exit PISANIO]
[p]A sly and constant knave,
[p]Not to be shaked; the agent for his master
[p]And the remembrancer of her to hold
[p]The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
[p]Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
[p]Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
[p]Except she bend her humour, shall be assured
[p]To taste of too.
[p][Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies]
[p]So, so: well done, well done:
[p]The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
[p]Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
[p]Think on my words.
"
"And shall do:
[p]But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
[p]I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.
"
"A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
[p]A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
[p]That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!
[p]My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
[p]Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
[p]As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
[p]Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,
[p]How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
[p]Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
"
"Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
[p]Comes from my lord with letters.
"
"Change you, madam?
[p]The worthy Leonatus is in safety
[p]And greets your highness dearly.
"
"Thanks, good sir:
[p]You're kindly welcome.
"
"[Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich!
[p]If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
[p]She is alone the Arabian bird, and I
[p]Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
[p]Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
[p]Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
[p]Rather directly fly.
"
"[Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
[p]kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
[p]him accordingly, as you value your trust--
[p]LEONATUS.'
[p]So far I read aloud:
[p]But even the very middle of my heart
[p]Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
[p]You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
[p]Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
[p]In all that I can do.
"
"Thanks, fairest lady.
[p]What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
[p]To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
[p]Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
[p]The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
[p]Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
[p]Partition make with spectacles so precious
[p]'Twixt fair and foul?
"
"What makes your admiration?
"
"It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys
[p]'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
[p]Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,
[p]For idiots in this case of favour would
[p]Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;
[p]Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
[p]Should make desire vomit emptiness,
[p]Not so allured to feed.
"
"What is the matter, trow?
"
"The cloyed will,
[p]That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
[p]Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb
[p]Longs after for the garbage.
"
"What, dear sir,
[p]Thus raps you? Are you well?
"
"Thanks, madam; well.
[p][To PISANIO]
[p]Beseech you, sir, desire
[p]My man's abode where I did leave him: he
[p]Is strange and peevish.
"
"I was going, sir,
[p]To give him welcome.
"
"Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?
"
"Well, madam.
"
"Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
"
"Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
[p]So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
[p]The Briton reveller.
"
"When he was here,
[p]He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
[p]Not knowing why.
"
"I never saw him sad.
[p]There is a Frenchman his companion, one
[p]An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
[p]A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces
[p]The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--
[p]Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
[p]Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
[p]By history, report, or his own proof,
[p]What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
[p]But must be, will his free hours languish for
[p]Assured bondage?'
"
"Will my lord say so?
"
"Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:
[p]It is a recreation to be by
[p]And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,
[p]Some men are much to blame.
"
"Not he, I hope.
"
"Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
[p]Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
[p]In you, which I account his beyond all talents,
[p]Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
[p]To pity too.
"
"What do you pity, sir?
"
"Two creatures heartily.
"
"Am I one, sir?
[p]You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
[p]Deserves your pity?
"
"Lamentable! What,
[p]To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
[p]I' the dungeon by a snuff?
"
"I pray you, sir,
[p]Deliver with more openness your answers
[p]To my demands. Why do you pity me?
"
"That others do--
[p]I was about to say--enjoy your--But
[p]It is an office of the gods to venge it,
[p]Not mine to speak on 't.
"
"You do seem to know
[p]Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--
[p]Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
[p]Than to be sure they do; for certainties
[p]Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
[p]The remedy then born--discover to me
[p]What both you spur and stop.
"
"Had I this cheek
[p]To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
[p]Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
[p]To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
[p]Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
[p]Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
[p]Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
[p]That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
[p]Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as
[p]With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
[p]Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
[p]That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
[p]That all the plagues of hell should at one time
[p]Encounter such revolt.
"
"My lord, I fear,
[p]Has forgot Britain.
"
"And himself. Not I,
[p]Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
[p]The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
[p]That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
[p]Charms this report out.
"
"Let me hear no more.
"
"O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
[p]With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
[p]So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
[p]Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd
[p]With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
[p]Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
[p]That play with all infirmities for gold
[p]Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
[p]As well might poison poison! Be revenged;
[p]Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
[p]Recoil from your great stock.
"
"Revenged!
[p]How should I be revenged? If this be true,--
[p]As I have such a heart that both mine ears
[p]Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
[p]How should I be revenged?
"
"Should he make me
[p]Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
[p]Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
[p]In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
[p]I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
[p]More noble than that runagate to your bed,
[p]And will continue fast to your affection,
[p]Still close as sure.
"
"What, ho, Pisanio!
"
"Let me my service tender on your lips.
"
"Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
[p]So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
[p]Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
[p]For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
[p]Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
[p]From thy report as thou from honour, and
[p]Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
[p]Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
[p]The king my father shall be made acquainted
[p]Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
[p]A saucy stranger in his court to mart
[p]As in a Romish stew and to expound
[p]His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
[p]He little cares for and a daughter who
[p]He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!
"
"O happy Leonatus! I may say
[p]The credit that thy lady hath of thee
[p]Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
[p]Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
[p]A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
[p]Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
[p]For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
[p]I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
[p]Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,
[p]That which he is, new o'er: and he is one
[p]The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
[p]That he enchants societies into him;
[p]Half all men's hearts are his.
"
"You make amends.
"
"He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
[p]He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
[p]More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
[p]Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
[p]To try your taking a false report; which hath
[p]Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
[p]In the election of a sir so rare,
[p]Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him
[p]Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
[p]Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.
"
"All's well, sir: take my power i' the court
[p]for yours.
"
"My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
[p]To entreat your grace but in a small request,
[p]And yet of moment to, for it concerns
[p]Your lord; myself and other noble friends,
[p]Are partners in the business.
"
"Pray, what is't?
"
"Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
[p]The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
[p]To buy a present for the emperor
[p]Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
[p]In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels
[p]Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
[p]And I am something curious, being strange,
[p]To have them in safe stowage: may it please you
[p]To take them in protection?
"
"Willingly;
[p]And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
[p]My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
[p]In my bedchamber.
"
"They are in a trunk,
[p]Attended by my men: I will make bold
[p]To send them to you, only for this night;
[p]I must aboard to-morrow.
"
"O, no, no.
"
"Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
[p]By lengthening my return. From Gallia
[p]I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
[p]To see your grace.
"
"I thank you for your pains:
[p]But not away to-morrow!
"
"O, I must, madam:
[p]Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
[p]To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:
[p]I have outstood my time; which is material
[p]To the tender of our present.
"
"I will write.
[p]Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
[p]And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.
"
"Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the
[p]jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a
[p]hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes
[p]must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine
[p]oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
"
"What got he by that? You have broke his pate with
[p]your bowl.
"
"[Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it,
[p]it would have run all out.
"
"When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for
[p]any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?
"
"No my lord;
[p][Aside]
[p]nor crop the ears of them.
"
"Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?
[p]Would he had been one of my rank!
"
"[Aside] To have smelt like a fool.
"
"I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a
[p]pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;
[p]they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my
[p]mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of
[p]fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that
[p]nobody can match.
"
"[Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
[p]cock, with your comb on.
"
"Sayest thou?
"
"It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
[p]companion that you give offence to.
"
"No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit
[p]offence to my inferiors.
"
"Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
"
"Why, so I say.
"
"Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
"
"A stranger, and I not know on't!
"
"[Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
[p]not.
"
"There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of
[p]Leonatus' friends.
"
"Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,
[p]whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
"
"One of your lordship's pages.
"
"Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
[p]derogation in't?
"
"You cannot derogate, my lord.
"
"Not easily, I think.
"
"[Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your
[p]issues, being foolish, do not derogate.
"
"Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost
[p]to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.
"
"I'll attend your lordship.
[p][Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord]
[p]That such a crafty devil as is his mother
[p]Should yield the world this ass! a woman that
[p]Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
[p]Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
[p]And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
[p]Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,
[p]Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
[p]A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
[p]More hateful than the foul expulsion is
[p]Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
[p]Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm
[p]The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked
[p]That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,
[p]To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!
"
"Who's there? my woman Helen?
"
"Please you, madam
"
"What hour is it?
"
"Almost midnight, madam.
"
"I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:
[p]Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:
[p]Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
[p]And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,
[p]I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly
[p][Exit Lady]
[p]To your protection I commend me, gods.
[p]From fairies and the tempters of the night
[p]Guard me, beseech ye.
"
"The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense
[p]Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
[p]Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd
[p]The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
[p]How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,
[p]And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
[p]But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
[p]How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
[p]Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper
[p]Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
[p]To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
[p]Under these windows, white and azure laced
[p]With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,
[p]To note the chamber: I will write all down:
[p]Such and such pictures; there the window; such
[p]The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,
[p]Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.
[p]Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
[p]Above ten thousand meaner moveables
[p]Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
[p]O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
[p]And be her sense but as a monument,
[p]Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:
[p][Taking off her bracelet]
[p]As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
[p]'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
[p]As strongly as the conscience does within,
[p]To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
[p]A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
[p]I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,
[p]Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
[p]Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
[p]The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
[p]Why should I write this down, that's riveted,
[p]Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
[p]The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
[p]Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
[p]To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
[p]Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
[p]May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
[p]Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.
[p][Clock strikes]
[p]One, two, three: time, time!
"
"Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the
[p]most coldest that ever turned up ace.
"
"It would make any man cold to lose.
"
"But not every man patient after the noble temper of
[p]your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
"
"Winning will put any man into courage. If I could
[p]get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.
[p]It's almost morning, is't not?
"
"Day, my lord.
"
"I would this music would come: I am advised to give
[p]her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.
[p][Enter Musicians]
[p]Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your
[p]fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none
[p]will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.
[p]First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;
[p]after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich
[p]words to it: and then let her consider.
[p][SONG]
[p]Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
[p]And Phoebus 'gins arise,
[p]His steeds to water at those springs
[p]On chaliced flowers that lies;
[p]And winking Mary-buds begin
[p]To ope their golden eyes:
[p]With every thing that pretty is,
[p]My lady sweet, arise:
[p]Arise, arise.
"
"So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will
[p]consider your music the better: if it do not, it is
[p]a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and
[p]calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
[p]boot, can never amend.
"
"Here comes the king.
"
"I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I
[p]was up so early: he cannot choose but take this
[p]service I have done fatherly.
[p][Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN]
[p]Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.
"
"Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
[p]Will she not forth?
"
"I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.
"
"The exile of her minion is too new;
[p]She hath not yet forgot him: some more time
[p]Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
[p]And then she's yours.
"
"You are most bound to the king,
[p]Who lets go by no vantages that may
[p]Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
[p]To orderly soliciting, and be friended
[p]With aptness of the season; make denials
[p]Increase your services; so seem as if
[p]You were inspired to do those duties which
[p]You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
[p]Save when command to your dismission tends,
[p]And therein you are senseless.
"
"Senseless! not so.
"
"So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
[p]The one is Caius Lucius.
"
"A worthy fellow,
[p]Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
[p]But that's no fault of his: we must receive him
[p]According to the honour of his sender;
[p]And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
[p]We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
[p]When you have given good morning to your mistress,
[p]Attend the queen and us; we shall have need
[p]To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.
"
"If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,
[p]Let her lie still and dream.
[p][Knocks]
[p]By your leave, ho!
[p]I Know her women are about her: what
[p]If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
[p]Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes
[p]Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
[p]Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold
[p]Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
[p]Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
[p]Can it not do and undo? I will make
[p]One of her women lawyer to me, for
[p]I yet not understand the case myself.
[p][Knocks]
[p]By your leave.
"
"Who's there that knocks?
"
"A gentleman.
"
"No more?
"
"Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.
"
"That's more
[p]Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
[p]Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?
"
"Your lady's person: is she ready?
"
"Ay,
[p]To keep her chamber.
"
"There is gold for you;
[p]Sell me your good report.
"
"How! my good name? or to report of you
[p]What I shall think is good?--The princess!
"
"Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.
"
"Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
[p]For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give
[p]Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
[p]And scarce can spare them.
"
"Still, I swear I love you.
"
"If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:
[p]If you swear still, your recompense is still
[p]That I regard it not.
"
"This is no answer.
"
"But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
[p]I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,
[p]I shall unfold equal discourtesy
[p]To your best kindness: one of your great knowing
[p]Should learn, being taught, forbearance.
"
"To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:
[p]I will not.
"
"Fools are not mad folks.
"
"Do you call me fool?
"
"As I am mad, I do:
[p]If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;
[p]That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
[p]You put me to forget a lady's manners,
[p]By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,
[p]That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
[p]By the very truth of it, I care not for you,
[p]And am so near the lack of charity--
[p]To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather
[p]You felt than make't my boast.
"
"You sin against
[p]Obedience, which you owe your father. For
[p]The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
[p]One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,
[p]With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:
[p]And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--
[p]Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,
[p]On whom there is no more dependency
[p]But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;
[p]Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
[p]The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil
[p]The precious note of it with a base slave.
[p]A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
[p]A pantler, not so eminent.
"
"Profane fellow
[p]Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
[p]But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
[p]To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,
[p]Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
[p]Comparative for your virtues, to be styled
[p]The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
[p]For being preferred so well.
"
"The south-fog rot him!
"
"He never can meet more mischance than come
[p]To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,
[p]That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer
[p]In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
[p]Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!
"
"'His garment!' Now the devil--
"
"To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--
"
"'His garment!'
"
"I am sprited with a fool.
[p]Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman
[p]Search for a jewel that too casually
[p]Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,
[p]If I would lose it for a revenue
[p]Of any king's in Europe. I do think
[p]I saw't this morning: confident I am
[p]Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
[p]I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
[p]That I kiss aught but he.
"
"'Twill not be lost.
"
"I hope so: go and search.
"
"You have abused me:
[p]'His meanest garment!'
"
"Ay, I said so, sir:
[p]If you will make't an action, call witness to't.
"
"I will inform your father.
"
"Your mother too:
[p]She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
[p]But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,
[p]To the worst of discontent.
"
"I'll be revenged:
[p]'His meanest garment!' Well.
"
"Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure
[p]To win the king as I am bold her honour
[p]Will remain hers.
"
"What means do you make to him?
"
"Not any, but abide the change of time,
[p]Quake in the present winter's state and wish
[p]That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,
[p]I barely gratify your love; they failing,
[p]I must die much your debtor.
"
"Your very goodness and your company
[p]O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
[p]Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius
[p]Will do's commission throughly: and I think
[p]He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
[p]Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
[p]Is yet fresh in their grief.
"
"I do believe,
[p]Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
[p]That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
[p]The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
[p]In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
[p]Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
[p]Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
[p]Smiled at their lack of skill, but found
[p]their courage
[p]Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,
[p]Now mingled with their courages, will make known
[p]To their approvers they are people such
[p]That mend upon the world.
"
"See! Iachimo!
"
"The swiftest harts have posted you by land;
[p]And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
[p]To make your vessel nimble.
"
"Welcome, sir.
"
"I hope the briefness of your answer made
[p]The speediness of your return.
"
"Your lady
[p]Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
"
"And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
[p]Look through a casement to allure false hearts
[p]And be false with them.
"
"Here are letters for you.
"
"Their tenor good, I trust.
"
"'Tis very like.
"
"Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
[p]When you were there?
"
"He was expected then,
[p]But not approach'd.
"
"All is well yet.
[p]Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not
[p]Too dull for your good wearing?
"
"If I had lost it,
[p]I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
[p]I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy
[p]A second night of such sweet shortness which
[p]Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.
"
"The stone's too hard to come by.
"
"Not a whit,
[p]Your lady being so easy.
"
"Make not, sir,
[p]Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we
[p]Must not continue friends.
"
"Good sir, we must,
[p]If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
[p]The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
[p]We were to question further: but I now
[p]Profess myself the winner of her honour,
[p]Together with your ring; and not the wronger
[p]Of her or you, having proceeded but
[p]By both your wills.
"
"If you can make't apparent
[p]That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
[p]And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion
[p]You had of her pure honour gains or loses
[p]Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both
[p]To who shall find them.
"
"Sir, my circumstances,
[p]Being so near the truth as I will make them,
[p]Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
[p]I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,
[p]You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
[p]You need it not.
"
"Proceed.
"
"First, her bedchamber,--
[p]Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess
[p]Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd
[p]With tapesty of silk and silver; the story
[p]Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
[p]And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
[p]The press of boats or pride: a piece of work
[p]So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
[p]In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd
[p]Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
[p]Since the true life on't was--
"
"This is true;
[p]And this you might have heard of here, by me,
[p]Or by some other.
"
"More particulars
[p]Must justify my knowledge.
"
"So they must,
[p]Or do your honour injury.
"
"The chimney
[p]Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
[p]Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures
[p]So likely to report themselves: the cutter
[p]Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,
[p]Motion and breath left out.
"
"This is a thing
[p]Which you might from relation likewise reap,
[p]Being, as it is, much spoke of.
"
"The roof o' the chamber
[p]With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--
[p]I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
[p]Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
[p]Depending on their brands.
"
"This is her honour!
[p]Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
[p]Be given to your remembrance--the description
[p]Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
[p]The wager you have laid.
"
"Then, if you can,
[p][Showing the bracelet]
[p]Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!
[p]And now 'tis up again: it must be married
[p]To that your diamond; I'll keep them.
"
"Jove!
[p]Once more let me behold it: is it that
[p]Which I left with her?
"
"Sir--I thank her--that:
[p]She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
[p]Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
[p]And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said
[p]She prized it once.
"
"May be she pluck'd it off
[p]To send it me.
"
"She writes so to you, doth she?
"
"O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;
[p][Gives the ring]
[p]It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
[p]Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
[p]Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,
[p]Where there's another man: the vows of women
[p]Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,
[p]Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.
[p]O, above measure false!
"
"Have patience, sir,
[p]And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
[p]It may be probable she lost it; or
[p]Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,
[p]Hath stol'n it from her?
"
"Very true;
[p]And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:
[p]Render to me some corporal sign about her,
[p]More evident than this; for this was stolen.
"
"By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.
"
"Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
[p]'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure
[p]She would not lose it: her attendants are
[p]All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
[p]And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:
[p]The cognizance of her incontinency
[p]Is this: she hath bought the name of whore
[p]thus dearly.
[p]There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
[p]Divide themselves between you!
"
"Sir, be patient:
[p]This is not strong enough to be believed
[p]Of one persuaded well of--
"
"Never talk on't;
[p]She hath been colted by him.
"
"If you seek
[p]For further satisfying, under her breast--
[p]Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud
[p]Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,
[p]I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger
[p]To feed again, though full. You do remember
[p]This stain upon her?
"
"Ay, and it doth confirm
[p]Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
[p]Were there no more but it.
"
"Will you hear more?
"
"Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;
[p]Once, and a million!
"
"I'll be sworn--
"
"No swearing.
[p]If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
[p]And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny
[p]Thou'st made me cuckold.
"
"I'll deny nothing.
"
"O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
[p]I will go there and do't, i' the court, before
[p]Her father. I'll do something--
"
"Quite besides
[p]The government of patience! You have won:
[p]Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath
[p]He hath against himself.
"
"With an my heart.
"
"Is there no way for men to be but women
[p]Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;
[p]And that most venerable man which I
[p]Did call my father, was I know not where
[p]When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools
[p]Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd
[p]The Dian of that time so doth my wife
[p]The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
[p]Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
[p]And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
[p]A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't
[p]Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
[p]As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!
[p]This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--
[p]Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,
[p]Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
[p]Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition
[p]But what he look'd for should oppose and she
[p]Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
[p]The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
[p]That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
[p]It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,
[p]The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
[p]Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
[p]Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
[p]Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
[p]All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,
[p]Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;
[p]For even to vice
[p]They are not constant but are changing still
[p]One vice, but of a minute old, for one
[p]Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,
[p]Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
[p]In a true hate, to pray they have their will:
[p]The very devils cannot plague them better.
"
"Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
"
"When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet
[p]Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
[p]Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain
[p]And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--
[p]Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less
[p]Than in his feats deserving it--for him
[p]And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
[p]Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
[p]Is left untender'd.
"
"And, to kill the marvel,
[p]Shall be so ever.
"
"There be many Caesars,
[p]Ere such another Julius. Britain is
[p]A world by itself; and we will nothing pay
[p]For wearing our own noses.
"
"That opportunity
[p]Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
[p]We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
[p]The kings your ancestors, together with
[p]The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
[p]As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
[p]With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,
[p]With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,
[p]But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
[p]Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
[p]Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--
[p]That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
[p]From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--
[p]Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,
[p]Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd
[p]As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
[p]The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--
[p]O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
[p]And Britons strut with courage.
"
"Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our
[p]kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,
[p]as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of
[p]them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such
[p]straight arms, none.
"
"Son, let your mother end.
"
"We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
[p]Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a
[p]hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If
[p]Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or
[p]put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute
[p]for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.
"
"You must know,
[p]Till the injurious Romans did extort
[p]This tribute from us, we were free:
[p]Caesar's ambition,
[p]Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
[p]The sides o' the world, against all colour here
[p]Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off
[p]Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
[p]Ourselves to be.
"
"[with Lords] We do.
"
"Say, then, to Caesar,
[p]Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
[p]Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar
[p]Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
[p]Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
[p]Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,
[p]Who was the first of Britain which did put
[p]His brows within a golden crown and call'd
[p]Himself a king.
"
"I am sorry, Cymbeline,
[p]That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--
[p]Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than
[p]Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:
[p]Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
[p]In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
[p]For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
[p]I thank thee for myself.
"
"Thou art welcome, Caius.
[p]Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
[p]Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;
[p]Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
[p]Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
[p]That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
[p]Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
[p]Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
[p]So Caesar shall not find them.
"
"Let proof speak.
"
"His majesty bids you welcome. Make
[p]pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if
[p]you seek us afterwards in other terms, you
[p]shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you
[p]beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in
[p]the adventure, our crows shall fare the better
[p]for you; and there's an end.
"
"So, sir.
"
"I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
[p]All the remain is 'Welcome!'
"
"How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
[p]What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,
[p]O master! what a strange infection
[p]Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,
[p]As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd
[p]On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:
[p]She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
[p]More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
[p]As would take in some virtue. O my master!
[p]Thy mind to her is now as low as were
[p]Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?
[p]Upon the love and truth and vows which I
[p]Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?
[p]If it be so to do good service, never
[p]Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,
[p]That I should seem to lack humanity
[p]so much as this fact comes to?
[p][Reading]
[p]'Do't: the letter
[p]that I have sent her, by her own command
[p]Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!
[p]Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
[p]Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st
[p]So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
[p]I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
"
"How now, Pisanio!
"
"Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
"
"Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!
[p]O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
[p]That knew the stars as I his characters;
[p]He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,
[p]Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
[p]Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not
[p]That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:
[p]Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
[p]For it doth physic love: of his content,
[p]All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
[p]You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
[p]And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:
[p]Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
[p]You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
[p][Reads]
[p]'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me
[p]in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as
[p]you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me
[p]with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,
[p]at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of
[p]this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all
[p]happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,
[p]increasing in love,
[p]LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'
[p]O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
[p]He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me
[p]How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
[p]May plod it in a week, why may not I
[p]Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--
[p]Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--
[p]let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,
[p]But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;
[p]For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;
[p]Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
[p]To the smothering of the sense--how far it is
[p]To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
[p]Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
[p]To inherit such a haven: but first of all,
[p]How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
[p]That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
[p]And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:
[p]Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?
[p]We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
[p]How many score of miles may we well ride
[p]'Twixt hour and hour?
"
"One score 'twixt sun and sun,
[p]Madam, 's enough for you:
[p][Aside]
[p]and too much too.
"
"Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
[p]Could never go so slow: I have heard of
[p]riding wagers,
[p]Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
[p]That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:
[p]Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
[p]She'll home to her father: and provide me presently
[p]A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
[p]A franklin's housewife.
"
"Madam, you're best consider.
"
"I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,
[p]Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,
[p]That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
[p]Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,
[p]Accessible is none but Milford way.
"
"A goodly day not to keep house, with such
[p]Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
[p]Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
[p]To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs
[p]Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
[p]And keep their impious turbans on, without
[p]Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
[p]We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
[p]As prouder livers do.
"
"Hail, heaven!
"
"Hail, heaven!
"
"Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;
[p]Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,
[p]When you above perceive me like a crow,
[p]That it is place which lessens and sets off;
[p]And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
[p]Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:
[p]This service is not service, so being done,
[p]But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,
[p]Draws us a profit from all things we see;
[p]And often, to our comfort, shall we find
[p]The sharded beetle in a safer hold
[p]Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
[p]Is nobler than attending for a cheque,
[p]Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,
[p]Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
[p]Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,
[p]Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.
"
"Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,
[p]Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not
[p]What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
[p]If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
[p]That have a sharper known; well corresponding
[p]With your stiff age: but unto us it is
[p]A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;
[p]A prison for a debtor, that not dares
[p]To stride a limit.
"
"What should we speak of
[p]When we are old as you? when we shall hear
[p]The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
[p]In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse
[p]The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
[p]We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,
[p]Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;
[p]Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
[p]We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,
[p]And sing our bondage freely.
"
"How you speak!
[p]Did you but know the city's usuries
[p]And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court
[p]As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
[p]Is certain falling, or so slippery that
[p]The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,
[p]A pain that only seems to seek out danger
[p]I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'
[p]the search,
[p]And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
[p]As record of fair act; nay, many times,
[p]Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
[p]Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story
[p]The world may read in me: my body's mark'd
[p]With Roman swords, and my report was once
[p]First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,
[p]And when a soldier was the theme, my name
[p]Was not far off: then was I as a tree
[p]Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,
[p]A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
[p]Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
[p]And left me bare to weather.
"
"Uncertain favour!
"
"My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
[p]But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
[p]Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
[p]I was confederate with the Romans: so
[p]Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
[p]This rock and these demesnes have been my world;
[p]Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
[p]More pious debts to heaven than in all
[p]The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
[p]This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
[p]The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;
[p]To him the other two shall minister;
[p]And we will fear no poison, which attends
[p]In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
[p][Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]
[p]How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
[p]These boys know little they are sons to the king;
[p]Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
[p]They think they are mine; and though train'd
[p]up thus meanly
[p]I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
[p]The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
[p]In simple and low things to prince it much
[p]Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
[p]The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
[p]The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!
[p]When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
[p]The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
[p]Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,
[p]And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then
[p]The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
[p]Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
[p]That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
[p]Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,
[p]Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
[p]His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!
[p]O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
[p]Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,
[p]At three and two years old, I stole these babes;
[p]Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
[p]Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,
[p]Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for
[p]their mother,
[p]And every day do honour to her grave:
[p]Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
[p]They take for natural father. The game is up.
"
"Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
[p]Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
[p]To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!
[p]Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,
[p]That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
[p]From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,
[p]Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
[p]Beyond self-explication: put thyself
[p]Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness
[p]Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
[p]Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with
[p]A look untender? If't be summer news,
[p]Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st
[p]But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!
[p]That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
[p]And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
[p]May take off some extremity, which to read
[p]Would be even mortal to me.
"
"Please you, read;
[p]And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
[p]The most disdain'd of fortune.
"
"[Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the
[p]strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie
[p]bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,
[p]but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
[p]as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,
[p]must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with
[p]the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away
[p]her life: I shall give thee opportunity at
[p]Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose
[p]where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
[p]it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
[p]equally to me disloyal.'
"
"What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
[p]Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
[p]Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
[p]Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
[p]Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
[p]All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,
[p]Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
[p]This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?
"
"False to his bed! What is it to be false?
[p]To lie in watch there and to think on him?
[p]To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep
[p]charge nature,
[p]To break it with a fearful dream of him
[p]And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?
"
"Alas, good lady!
"
"I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,
[p]Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
[p]Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
[p]Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy
[p]Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
[p]Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;
[p]And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
[p]I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,
[p]Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
[p]By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
[p]Put on for villany; not born where't grows,
[p]But worn a bait for ladies.
"
"Good madam, hear me.
"
"True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,
[p]Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
[p]Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
[p]From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,
[p]Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
[p]Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
[p]From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:
[p]Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,
[p]A little witness my obedience: look!
[p]I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit
[p]The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;
[p]Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
[p]Thy master is not there, who was indeed
[p]The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
[p]Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
[p]But now thou seem'st a coward.
"
"Hence, vile instrument!
[p]Thou shalt not damn my hand.
"
"Why, I must die;
[p]And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
[p]No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
[p]There is a prohibition so divine
[p]That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.
[p]Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;
[p]Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
[p]The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
[p]All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
[p]Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
[p]Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
[p]Believe false teachers: though those that
[p]are betray'd
[p]Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
[p]Stands in worse case of woe.
[p]And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
[p]My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
[p]And make me put into contempt the suits
[p]Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
[p]It is no act of common passage, but
[p]A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
[p]To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
[p]That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
[p]Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:
[p]The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
[p]Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
[p]When I desire it too.
"
"O gracious lady,
[p]Since I received command to do this business
[p]I have not slept one wink.
"
"Do't, and to bed then.
"
"I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.
"
"Wherefore then
[p]Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
[p]So many miles with a pretence? this place?
[p]Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
[p]The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
[p]For my being absent? whereunto I never
[p]Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
[p]To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
[p]The elected deer before thee?
"
"But to win time
[p]To lose so bad employment; in the which
[p]I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
[p]Hear me with patience.
"
"Talk thy tongue weary; speak
[p]I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear
[p]Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
[p]Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
"
"Then, madam,
[p]I thought you would not back again.
"
"Most like;
[p]Bringing me here to kill me.
"
"Not so, neither:
[p]But if I were as wise as honest, then
[p]My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
[p]But that my master is abused:
[p]Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.
[p]Hath done you both this cursed injury.
"
"Some Roman courtezan.
"
"No, on my life.
[p]I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
[p]Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded
[p]I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
[p]And that will well confirm it.
"
"Why good fellow,
[p]What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?
[p]Or in my life what comfort, when I am
[p]Dead to my husband?
"
"If you'll back to the court--
"
"No court, no father; nor no more ado
[p]With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
[p]That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
[p]As fearful as a siege.
"
"If not at court,
[p]Then not in Britain must you bide.
"
"Where then
[p]Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
[p]Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume
[p]Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;
[p]In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think
[p]There's livers out of Britain.
"
"I am most glad
[p]You think of other place. The ambassador,
[p]Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
[p]To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind
[p]Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
[p]That which, to appear itself, must not yet be
[p]But by self-danger, you should tread a course
[p]Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near
[p]The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least
[p]That though his actions were not visible, yet
[p]Report should render him hourly to your ear
[p]As truly as he moves.
"
"O, for such means!
[p]Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
[p]I would adventure.
"
"Well, then, here's the point:
[p]You must forget to be a woman; change
[p]Command into obedience: fear and niceness--
[p]The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
[p]Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:
[p]Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and
[p]As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must
[p]Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
[p]Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
[p]Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch
[p]Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
[p]Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
[p]You made great Juno angry.
"
"Nay, be brief
[p]I see into thy end, and am almost
[p]A man already.
"
"First, make yourself but like one.
[p]Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--
[p]'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all
[p]That answer to them: would you in their serving,
[p]And with what imitation you can borrow
[p]From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius
[p]Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
[p]wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,
[p]If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless
[p]With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable
[p]And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,
[p]You have me, rich; and I will never fail
[p]Beginning nor supplyment.
"
"Thou art all the comfort
[p]The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:
[p]There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even
[p]All that good time will give us: this attempt
[p]I am soldier to, and will abide it with
[p]A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
"
"Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
[p]Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
[p]Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
[p]Here is a box; I had it from the queen:
[p]What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,
[p]Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
[p]Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
[p]And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
[p]Direct you to the best!
"
"Amen: I thank thee.
"
"Thus far; and so farewell.
"
"Thanks, royal sir.
[p]My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;
[p]And am right sorry that I must report ye
[p]My master's enemy.
"
"Our subjects, sir,
[p]Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself
[p]To show less sovereignty than they, must needs
[p]Appear unkinglike.
"
"So, sir: I desire of you
[p]A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.
[p]Madam, all joy befal your grace!
"
"And you!
"
"My lords, you are appointed for that office;
[p]The due of honour in no point omit.
[p]So farewell, noble Lucius.
"
"Your hand, my lord.
"
"Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
[p]I wear it as your enemy.
"
"Sir, the event
[p]Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.
"
"Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
[p]Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!
"
"He goes hence frowning: but it honours us
[p]That we have given him cause.
"
"'Tis all the better;
[p]Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
"
"Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
[p]How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
[p]Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:
[p]The powers that he already hath in Gallia
[p]Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
[p]His war for Britain.
"
"'Tis not sleepy business;
[p]But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.
"
"Our expectation that it would be thus
[p]Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
[p]Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
[p]Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
[p]The duty of the day: she looks us like
[p]A thing more made of malice than of duty:
[p]We have noted it. Call her before us; for
[p]We have been too slight in sufferance.
"
"Royal sir,
[p]Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
[p]Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
[p]'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,
[p]Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady
[p]So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
[p]And strokes death to her.
"
"Where is she, sir? How
[p]Can her contempt be answer'd?
"
"Please you, sir,
[p]Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer
[p]That will be given to the loudest noise we make.
"
"My lord, when last I went to visit her,
[p]She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
[p]Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,
[p]She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
[p]Which daily she was bound to proffer: this
[p]She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
[p]Made me to blame in memory.
"
"Her doors lock'd?
[p]Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
[p]Prove false!
"
"Son, I say, follow the king.
"
"That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
[p]have not seen these two days.
"
"Go, look after.
[p][Exit CLOTEN]
[p]Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
[p]He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
[p]Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
[p]It is a thing most precious. But for her,
[p]Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,
[p]Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
[p]To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
[p]To death or to dishonour; and my end
[p]Can make good use of either: she being down,
[p]I have the placing of the British crown.
[p][Re-enter CLOTEN]
[p]How now, my son!
"
"'Tis certain she is fled.
[p]Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none
[p]Dare come about him.
"
"[Aside] All the better: may
[p]This night forestall him of the coming day!
"
"I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,
[p]And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
[p]Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one
[p]The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
[p]Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but
[p]Disdaining me and throwing favours on
[p]The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
[p]That what's else rare is choked; and in that point
[p]I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
[p]To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--
[p][Enter PISANIO]
[p]Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
[p]Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,
[p]Where is thy lady? In a word; or else
[p]Thou art straightway with the fiends.
"
"O, good my lord!
"
"Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--
[p]I will not ask again. Close villain,
[p]I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
[p]Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
[p]From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
[p]A dram of worth be drawn.
"
"Alas, my lord,
[p]How can she be with him? When was she missed?
[p]He is in Rome.
"
"Where is she, sir? Come nearer;
[p]No further halting: satisfy me home
[p]What is become of her.
"
"O, my all-worthy lord!
"
"All-worthy villain!
[p]Discover where thy mistress is at once,
[p]At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'
[p]Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
[p]Thy condemnation and thy death.
"
"Then, sir,
[p]This paper is the history of my knowledge
[p]Touching her flight.
"
"Let's see't. I will pursue her
[p]Even to Augustus' throne.
"
"[Aside] Or this, or perish.
[p]She's far enough; and what he learns by this
[p]May prove his travel, not her danger.
"
"Hum!
"
"[Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
[p]Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
"
"Sirrah, is this letter true?
"
"Sir, as I think.
"
"It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou
[p]wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,
[p]undergo those employments wherein I should have
[p]cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,
[p]what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it
[p]directly and truly, I would think thee an honest
[p]man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
[p]relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
"
"Well, my good lord.
"
"Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and
[p]constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
[p]that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the
[p]course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of
[p]mine: wilt thou serve me?
"
"Sir, I will.
"
"Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy
[p]late master's garments in thy possession?
"
"I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he
[p]wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
"
"The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit
[p]hither: let it be thy lint service; go.
"
"I shall, my lord.
"
"Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one
[p]thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou
[p]villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these
[p]garments were come. She said upon a time--the
[p]bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she
[p]held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
[p]than my noble and natural person together with the
[p]adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my
[p]back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her
[p]eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then
[p]be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my
[p]speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and
[p]when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex
[p]her I will execute in the clothes that she so
[p]praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot
[p]her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,
[p]and I'll be merry in my revenge.
[p][Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes]
[p]Be those the garments?
"
"Ay, my noble lord.
"
"How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?
"
"She can scarce be there yet.
"
"Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second
[p]thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,
[p]that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be
[p]but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself
[p]to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had
[p]wings to follow it! Come, and be true.
"
"Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee
[p]Were to prove false, which I will never be,
[p]To him that is most true. To Milford go,
[p]And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
[p]You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed
[p]Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!
"
"I see a man's life is a tedious one:
[p]I have tired myself, and for two nights together
[p]Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,
[p]But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
[p]When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
[p]Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think
[p]Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
[p]Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me
[p]I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,
[p]That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
[p]A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
[p]When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
[p]Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
[p]Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
[p]Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,
[p]My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
[p]At point to sink for food. But what is this?
[p]Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:
[p]I were best not to call; I dare not call:
[p]yet famine,
[p]Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,
[p]Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever
[p]Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
[p]If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,
[p]Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.
[p]Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy
[p]But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.
[p]Such a foe, good heavens!
"
"You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and
[p]Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I
[p]Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:
[p]The sweat of industry would dry and die,
[p]But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs
[p]Will make what's homely savoury: weariness
[p]Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
[p]Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
[p]Poor house, that keep'st thyself!
"
"I am thoroughly weary.
"
"I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
"
"There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,
[p]Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
"
"[Looking into the cave]
[p]Stay; come not in.
[p]But that it eats our victuals, I should think
[p]Here were a fairy.
"
"What's the matter, sir?
"
"By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
[p]An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
[p]No elder than a boy!
"
"Good masters, harm me not:
[p]Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought
[p]To have begg'd or bought what I have took:
[p]good troth,
[p]I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found
[p]Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:
[p]I would have left it on the board so soon
[p]As I had made my meal, and parted
[p]With prayers for the provider.
"
"Money, youth?
"
"All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
[p]As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those
[p]Who worship dirty gods.
"
"I see you're angry:
[p]Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
[p]Have died had I not made it.
"
"Whither bound?
"
"To Milford-Haven.
"
"What's your name?
"
"Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
[p]Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;
[p]To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
[p]I am fall'n in this offence.
"
"Prithee, fair youth,
[p]Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
[p]By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!
[p]'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer
[p]Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.
[p]Boys, bid him welcome.
"
"Were you a woman, youth,
[p]I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,
[p]I bid for you as I'd buy.
"
"I'll make't my comfort
[p]He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:
[p]And such a welcome as I'd give to him
[p]After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!
[p]Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.
"
"'Mongst friends,
[p]If brothers.
[p][Aside]
[p]Would it had been so, that they
[p]Had been my father's sons! then had my prize
[p]Been less, and so more equal ballasting
[p]To thee, Posthumus.
"
"He wrings at some distress.
"
"Would I could free't!
"
"Or I, whate'er it be,
[p]What pain it cost, what danger. God's!
"
"Hark, boys.
"
"Great men,
[p]That had a court no bigger than this cave,
[p]That did attend themselves and had the virtue
[p]Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by
[p]That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--
[p]Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
[p]I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
[p]Since Leonatus's false.
"
"It shall be so.
[p]Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:
[p]Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,
[p]We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
[p]So far as thou wilt speak it.
"
"Pray, draw near.
"
"The night to the owl and morn to the lark
[p]less welcome.
"
"Thanks, sir.
"
"I pray, draw near.
"
"This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:
[p]That since the common men are now in action
[p]'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
[p]And that the legions now in Gallia are
[p]Full weak to undertake our wars against
[p]The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
[p]The gentry to this business. He creates
[p]Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,
[p]For this immediate levy, he commends
[p]His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
"
"Is Lucius general of the forces?
"
"Ay.
"
"Remaining now in Gallia?
"
"With those legions
[p]Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
[p]Must be supplyant: the words of your commission
[p]Will tie you to the numbers and the time
[p]Of their dispatch.
"
"We will discharge our duty.
"
"I am near to the place where they should meet, if
[p]Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments
[p]serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by
[p]him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the
[p]rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said
[p]a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must
[p]play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it
[p]is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer
[p]in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are
[p]as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,
[p]not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the
[p]advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike
[p]conversant in general services, and more remarkable
[p]in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant
[p]thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!
[p]Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy
[p]shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy
[p]mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before
[p]thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her
[p]father; who may haply be a little angry for my so
[p]rough usage; but my mother, having power of his
[p]testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My
[p]horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore
[p]purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is
[p]the very description of their meeting-place; and
[p]the fellow dares not deceive me.
"
"[To IMOGEN] You are not well: remain here in the cave;
[p]We'll come to you after hunting.
"
"[To IMOGEN]. Brother, stay here
[p]Are we not brothers?
"
"So man and man should be;
[p]But clay and clay differs in dignity,
[p]Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.
"
"Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
"
"So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
[p]But not so citizen a wanton as
[p]To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;
[p]Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
[p]Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
[p]Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
[p]To one not sociable: I am not very sick,
[p]Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:
[p]I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,
[p]Stealing so poorly.
"
"I love thee; I have spoke it
[p]How much the quantity, the weight as much,
[p]As I do love my father.
"
"What! how! how!
"
"If it be sin to say so, I yoke me
[p]In my good brother's fault: I know not why
[p]I love this youth; and I have heard you say,
[p]Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,
[p]And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say
[p]'My father, not this youth.'
"
"[Aside]. O noble strain!
[p]O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
[p]Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:
[p]Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
[p]I'm not their father; yet who this should be,
[p]Doth miracle itself, loved before me.
[p]'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.
"
"Brother, farewell.
"
"I wish ye sport.
"
"You health. So please you, sir.
"
"[Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies
[p]I have heard!
[p]Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:
[p]Experience, O, thou disprovest report!
[p]The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish
[p]Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
[p]I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,
[p]I'll now taste of thy drug.
"
"I could not stir him:
[p]He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
[p]Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.
"
"Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter
[p]I might know more.
"
"To the field, to the field!
[p]We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.
"
"We'll not be long away.
"
"Pray, be not sick,
[p]For you must be our housewife.
"
"Well or ill,
[p]I am bound to you.
"
"And shalt be ever.
[p][Exit IMOGEN, to the cave]
[p]This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had
[p]Good ancestors.
"
"How angel-like he sings!
"
"But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
[p]In characters,
[p]And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick
[p]And he her dieter.
"
"Nobly he yokes
[p]A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
[p]Was that it was, for not being such a smile;
[p]The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly
[p]From so divine a temple, to commix
[p]With winds that sailors rail at.
"
"I do note
[p]That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
[p]Mingle their spurs together.
"
"Grow, patience!
[p]And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
[p]His perishing root with the increasing vine!
"
"It is great morning. Come, away!--
[p]Who's there?
"
"I cannot find those runagates; that villain
[p]Hath mock'd me. I am faint.
"
"'Those runagates!'
[p]Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis
[p]Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.
[p]I saw him not these many years, and yet
[p]I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!
"
"He is but one: you and my brother search
[p]What companies are near: pray you, away;
[p]Let me alone with him.
"
"Soft! What are you
[p]That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?
[p]I have heard of such. What slave art thou?
"
"A thing
[p]More slavish did I ne'er than answering
[p]A slave without a knock.
"
"Thou art a robber,
[p]A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.
"
"To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I
[p]An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
[p]Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
[p]My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
[p]Why I should yield to thee?
"
"Thou villain base,
[p]Know'st me not by my clothes?
"
"No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
[p]Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
[p]Which, as it seems, make thee.
"
"Thou precious varlet,
[p]My tailor made them not.
"
"Hence, then, and thank
[p]The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
[p]I am loath to beat thee.
"
"Thou injurious thief,
[p]Hear but my name, and tremble.
"
"What's thy name?
"
"Cloten, thou villain.
"
"Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
[p]I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or
[p]Adder, Spider,
[p]'Twould move me sooner.
"
"To thy further fear,
[p]Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
[p]I am son to the queen.
"
"I am sorry for 't; not seeming
[p]So worthy as thy birth.
"
"Art not afeard?
"
"Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:
[p]At fools I laugh, not fear them.
"
"Die the death:
[p]When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
[p]I'll follow those that even now fled hence,
[p]And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:
[p]Yield, rustic mountaineer.
"
"No companies abroad?
"
"None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
"
"I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,
[p]But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
[p]Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
[p]And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute
[p]'Twas very Cloten.
"
"In this place we left them:
[p]I wish my brother make good time with him,
[p]You say he is so fell.
"
"Being scarce made up,
[p]I mean, to man, he had not apprehension
[p]Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment
[p]Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.
"
"This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
[p]There was no money in't: not Hercules
[p]Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:
[p]Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
[p]My head as I do his.
"
"What hast thou done?
"
"I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
[p]Son to the queen, after his own report;
[p]Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
[p]With his own single hand he'ld take us in
[p]Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,
[p]And set them on Lud's-town.
"
"We are all undone.
"
"Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,
[p]But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
[p]Protects not us: then why should we be tender
[p]To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
[p]Play judge and executioner all himself,
[p]For we do fear the law? What company
[p]Discover you abroad?
"
"No single soul
[p]Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason
[p]He must have some attendants. Though his humour
[p]Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
[p]From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not
[p]Absolute madness could so far have raved
[p]To bring him here alone; although perhaps
[p]It may be heard at court that such as we
[p]Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
[p]May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--
[p]As it is like him--might break out, and swear
[p]He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable
[p]To come alone, either he so undertaking,
[p]Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,
[p]If we do fear this body hath a tail
[p]More perilous than the head.
"
"Let ordinance
[p]Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,
[p]My brother hath done well.
"
"I had no mind
[p]To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness
[p]Did make my way long forth.
"
"With his own sword,
[p]Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
[p]His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
[p]Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,
[p]And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:
[p]That's all I reck.
"
"I fear 'twill be revenged:
[p]Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour
[p]Becomes thee well enough.
"
"Would I had done't
[p]So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,
[p]I love thee brotherly, but envy much
[p]Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,
[p]That possible strength might meet, would seek us through
[p]And put us to our answer.
"
"Well, 'tis done:
[p]We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger
[p]Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;
[p]You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay
[p]Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him
[p]To dinner presently.
"
"Poor sick Fidele!
[p]I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour
[p]I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,
[p]And praise myself for charity.
"
"O thou goddess,
[p]Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st
[p]In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
[p]As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
[p]Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
[p]Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,
[p]That by the top doth take the mountain pine,
[p]And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder
[p]That an invisible instinct should frame them
[p]To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,
[p]Civility not seen from other, valour
[p]That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
[p]As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
[p]What Cloten's being here to us portends,
[p]Or what his death will bring us.
"
"Where's my brother?
[p]I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
[p]In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage
[p]For his return.
"
"My ingenious instrument!
[p]Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion
[p]Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
"
"Is he at home?
"
"He went hence even now.
"
"What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
[p]it did not speak before. All solemn things
[p]Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
[p]Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
[p]Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
[p]Is Cadwal mad?
"
"Look, here he comes,
[p]And brings the dire occasion in his arms
[p]Of what we blame him for.
[p][Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead,]
[p]bearing her in his arms]
"
"The bird is dead
[p]That we have made so much on. I had rather
[p]Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
[p]To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,
[p]Than have seen this.
"
"O sweetest, fairest lily!
[p]My brother wears thee not the one half so well
[p]As when thou grew'st thyself.
"
"O melancholy!
[p]Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
[p]The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare
[p]Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
[p]Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,
[p]Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
[p]How found you him?
"
"Stark, as you see:
[p]Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,
[p]Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his
[p]right cheek
[p]Reposing on a cushion.
"
"Where?
"
"O' the floor;
[p]His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put
[p]My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
[p]Answer'd my steps too loud.
"
"Why, he but sleeps:
[p]If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;
[p]With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
[p]And worms will not come to thee.
"
"With fairest flowers
[p]Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
[p]I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
[p]The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor
[p]The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor
[p]The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
[p]Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,
[p]With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming
[p]Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
[p]Without a monument!--bring thee all this;
[p]Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,
[p]To winter-ground thy corse.
"
"Prithee, have done;
[p]And do not play in wench-like words with that
[p]Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
[p]And not protract with admiration what
[p]Is now due debt. To the grave!
"
"Say, where shall's lay him?
"
"By good Euriphile, our mother.
"
"Be't so:
[p]And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
[p]Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,
[p]As once our mother; use like note and words,
[p]Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
"
"Cadwal,
[p]I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;
[p]For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
[p]Than priests and fanes that lie.
"
"We'll speak it, then.
"
"Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten
[p]Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
[p]And though he came our enemy, remember
[p]He was paid for that: though mean and
[p]mighty, rotting
[p]Together, have one dust, yet reverence,
[p]That angel of the world, doth make distinction
[p]Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely
[p]And though you took his life, as being our foe,
[p]Yet bury him as a prince.
"
"Pray You, fetch him hither.
[p]Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
[p]When neither are alive.
"
"If you'll go fetch him,
[p]We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.
"
"Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;
[p]My father hath a reason for't.
"
"'Tis true.
"
"Come on then, and remove him.
"
"So. Begin.
"
"Fear no more the heat o' the sun,
[p]Nor the furious winter's rages;
[p]Thou thy worldly task hast done,
[p]Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:
[p]Golden lads and girls all must,
[p]As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.
"
"Fear no more the frown o' the great;
[p]Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;
[p]Care no more to clothe and eat;
[p]To thee the reed is as the oak:
[p]The sceptre, learning, physic, must
[p]All follow this, and come to dust.
"
"Fear no more the lightning flash,
"
"Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;
"
"Fear not slander, censure rash;
"
"Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:
"
"[with Arviragus] All lovers young, all lovers must
[p]Consign to thee, and come to dust.
"
"No exorciser harm thee!
"
"Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
"
"Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
"
"Nothing ill come near thee!
"
"[with Arviragus] Quiet consummation have;
[p]And renowned be thy grave!
"
"We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.
"
"Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:
[p]The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night
[p]Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.
[p]You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so
[p]These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.
[p]Come on, away: apart upon our knees.
[p]The ground that gave them first has them again:
[p]Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.
"
"[Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is
[p]the way?--
[p]I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?
[p]'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--
[p]I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
[p]But, soft! no bedfellow!--O gods and goddesses!
[p][Seeing the body of CLOTEN]
[p]These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
[p]This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;
[p]For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
[p]And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;
[p]'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
[p]Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes
[p]Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,
[p]I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be
[p]Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
[p]As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
[p]The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is
[p]Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.
[p]A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!
[p]I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;
[p]His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
[p]The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face
[p]Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,
[p]All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
[p]And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
[p]Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
[p]Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
[p]Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio
[p]Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--
[p]From this most bravest vessel of the world
[p]Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,
[p]Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!
[p]where's that?
[p]Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
[p]And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
[p]'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them
[p]Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
[p]The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
[p]And cordial to me, have I not found it
[p]Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:
[p]This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!
[p]Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
[p]That we the horrider may seem to those
[p]Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!
[p][Falls on the body]
[p][Enter LUCIUS, a Captain and other Officers,]
[p]and a Soothsayer]
"
"To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,
[p]After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
[p]You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
[p]They are in readiness.
"
"But what from Rome?
"
"The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
[p]And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,
[p]That promise noble service: and they come
[p]Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
[p]Syenna's brother.
"
"When expect you them?
"
"With the next benefit o' the wind.
"
"This forwardness
[p]Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
[p]Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,
[p]What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?
"
"Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--
[p]I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:
[p]I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
[p]From the spongy south to this part of the west,
[p]There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--
[p]Unless my sins abuse my divination--
[p]Success to the Roman host.
"
"Dream often so,
[p]And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
[p]Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
[p]It was a worthy building. How! a page!
[p]Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;
[p]For nature doth abhor to make his bed
[p]With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.
[p]Let's see the boy's face.
"
"He's alive, my lord.
"
"He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
[p]Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
[p]They crave to be demanded. Who is this
[p]Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
[p]That, otherwise than noble nature did,
[p]Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest
[p]In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?
[p]What art thou?
"
"I am nothing: or if not,
[p]Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
[p]A very valiant Briton and a good,
[p]That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
[p]There is no more such masters: I may wander
[p]From east to occident, cry out for service,
[p]Try many, all good, serve truly, never
[p]Find such another master.
"
"'Lack, good youth!
[p]Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
[p]Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.
"
"Richard du Champ.
[p][Aside]
[p]If I do lie and do
[p]No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
[p]They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?
"
"Thy name?
"
"Fidele, sir.
"
"Thou dost approve thyself the very same:
[p]Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
[p]Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
[p]Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,
[p]No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,
[p]Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
[p]Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.
"
"I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,
[p]I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
[p]As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
[p]With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,
[p]And on it said a century of prayers,
[p]Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
[p]And leaving so his service, follow you,
[p]So please you entertain me.
"
"Ay, good youth!
[p]And rather father thee than master thee.
[p]My friends,
[p]The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us
[p]Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
[p]And make him with our pikes and partisans
[p]A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
[p]By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd
[p]As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes
[p]Some falls are means the happier to arise.
"
"Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.
[p][Exit an Attendant]
[p]A fever with the absence of her son,
[p]A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
[p]How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
[p]The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
[p]Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
[p]When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
[p]So needful for this present: it strikes me, past
[p]The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
[p]Who needs must know of her departure and
[p]Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee
[p]By a sharp torture.
"
"Sir, my life is yours;
[p]I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,
[p]I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
[p]Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,
[p]Hold me your loyal servant.
"
"Good my liege,
[p]The day that she was missing he was here:
[p]I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
[p]All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
[p]There wants no diligence in seeking him,
[p]And will, no doubt, be found.
"
"The time is troublesome.
[p][To PISANIO]
[p]We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy
[p]Does yet depend.
"
"So please your majesty,
[p]The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
[p]Are landed on your coast, with a supply
[p]Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.
"
"Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
[p]I am amazed with matter.
"
"Good my liege,
[p]Your preparation can affront no less
[p]Than what you hear of: come more, for more
[p]you're ready:
[p]The want is but to put those powers in motion
[p]That long to move.
"
"I thank you. Let's withdraw;
[p]And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
[p]What can from Italy annoy us; but
[p]We grieve at chances here. Away!
"
"I heard no letter from my master since
[p]I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
[p]Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
[p]To yield me often tidings: neither know I
[p]What is betid to Cloten; but remain
[p]Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
[p]Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.
[p]These present wars shall find I love my country,
[p]Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.
[p]All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:
[p]Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.
"
"The noise is round about us.
"
"Let us from it.
"
"What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
[p]From action and adventure?
"
"Nay, what hope
[p]Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans
[p]Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
[p]For barbarous and unnatural revolts
[p]During their use, and slay us after.
"
"Sons,
[p]We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.
[p]To the king's party there's no going: newness
[p]Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd
[p]Among the bands--may drive us to a render
[p]Where we have lived, and so extort from's that
[p]Which we have done, whose answer would be death
[p]Drawn on with torture.
"
"This is, sir, a doubt
[p]In such a time nothing becoming you,
[p]Nor satisfying us.
"
"It is not likely
[p]That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
[p]Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes
[p]And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
[p]That they will waste their time upon our note,
[p]To know from whence we are.
"
"O, I am known
[p]Of many in the army: many years,
[p]Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
[p]From my remembrance. And, besides, the king
[p]Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;
[p]Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
[p]The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless
[p]To have the courtesy your cradle promised,
[p]But to be still hot summer's tamings and
[p]The shrinking slaves of winter.
"
"Than be so
[p]Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:
[p]I and my brother are not known; yourself
[p]So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
[p]Cannot be question'd.
"
"By this sun that shines,
[p]I'll thither: what thing is it that I never
[p]Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,
[p]But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
[p]Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
[p]A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
[p]Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
[p]To look upon the holy sun, to have
[p]The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
[p]So long a poor unknown.
"
"By heavens, I'll go:
[p]If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
[p]I'll take the better care, but if you will not,
[p]The hazard therefore due fall on me by
[p]The hands of Romans!
"
"So say I. amen.
"
"No reason I, since of your lives you set
[p]So slight a valuation, should reserve
[p]My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!
[p]If in your country wars you chance to die,
[p]That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:
[p]Lead, lead.
[p][Aside]
[p]The time seems long; their blood
[p]thinks scorn,
[p]Till it fly out and show them princes born.
"
"Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd
[p]Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
[p]If each of you should take this course, how many
[p]Must murder wives much better than themselves
[p]For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
[p]Every good servant does not all commands:
[p]No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
[p]Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never
[p]Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
[p]The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
[p]Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,
[p]You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
[p]To have them fall no more: you some permit
[p]To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
[p]And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.
[p]But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,
[p]And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
[p]Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
[p]Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough
[p]That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!
[p]I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
[p]Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
[p]Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
[p]As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight
[p]Against the part I come with; so I'll die
[p]For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
[p]Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,
[p]Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
[p]Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
[p]More valour in me than my habits show.
[p]Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!
[p]To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin
[p]The fashion, less without and more within.
"
"The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
[p]Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,
[p]The princess of this country, and the air on't
[p]Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,
[p]A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me
[p]In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne
[p]As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.
[p]If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
[p]This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
[p]Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.
[p][Exit]
[p][The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is]
[p]taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS,
[p]GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]
"
"Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;
[p]The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but
[p]The villany of our fears.
"
"[with Arviragus] Stand, stand, and fight!
[p][Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the]
[p]Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then
[p]re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN]
"
"Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;
[p]For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
[p]As war were hoodwink'd.
"
"'Tis their fresh supplies.
"
"It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes
[p]Let's reinforce, or fly.
"
"Camest thou from where they made the stand?
"
"I did.
[p]Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.
"
"I did.
"
"No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,
[p]But that the heavens fought: the king himself
[p]Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
[p]And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying
[p]Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,
[p]Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work
[p]More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down
[p]Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
[p]Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd
[p]With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
[p]To die with lengthen'd shame.
"
"Where was this lane?
"
"Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;
[p]Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
[p]An honest one, I warrant; who deserved
[p]So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
[p]In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,
[p]He, with two striplings-lads more like to run
[p]The country base than to commit such slaughter
[p]With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
[p]Than those for preservation cased, or shame--
[p]Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,
[p]'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:
[p]To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;
[p]Or we are Romans and will give you that
[p]Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
[p]But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'
[p]These three,
[p]Three thousand confident, in act as many--
[p]For three performers are the file when all
[p]The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'
[p]Accommodated by the place, more charming
[p]With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd
[p]A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,
[p]Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,
[p]turn'd coward
[p]But by example--O, a sin in war,
[p]Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
[p]The way that they did, and to grin like lions
[p]Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
[p]A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon
[p]A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly
[p]Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
[p]The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,
[p]Like fragments in hard voyages, became
[p]The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open
[p]Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
[p]Some slain before; some dying; some their friends
[p]O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,
[p]Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:
[p]Those that would die or ere resist are grown
[p]The mortal bugs o' the field.
"
"This was strange chance
[p]A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
"
"Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
[p]Rather to wonder at the things you hear
[p]Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
[p]And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:
[p]'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,
[p]Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'
"
"Nay, be not angry, sir.
"
"'Lack, to what end?
[p]Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
[p]For if he'll do as he is made to do,
[p]I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
[p]You have put me into rhyme.
"
"Farewell; you're angry.
"
"Still going?
[p][Exit Lord]
[p]This is a lord! O noble misery,
[p]To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!
[p]To-day how many would have given their honours
[p]To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,
[p]And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
[p]Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
[p]Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,
[p]'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
[p]Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we
[p]That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him
[p]For being now a favourer to the Briton,
[p]No more a Briton, I have resumed again
[p]The part I came in: fight I will no more,
[p]But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
[p]Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
[p]Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
[p]Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;
[p]On either side I come to spend my breath;
[p]Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
[p]But end it by some means for Imogen.
"
"Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.
[p]'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
"
"There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,
[p]That gave the affront with them.
"
"So 'tis reported:
[p]But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?
"
"A Roman,
[p]Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds
[p]Had answer'd him.
"
"Lay hands on him; a dog!
[p]A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
[p]What crows have peck'd them here. He brags
[p]his service
[p]As if he were of note: bring him to the king.
[p][Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,]
[p]PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives.
[p]The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to
[p]CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler:
[p]then exeunt omnes]
"
"You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;
[p]So graze as you find pasture.
"
"Ay, or a stomach.
"
"Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,
[p]think, to liberty: yet am I better
[p]Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather
[p]Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
[p]By the sure physician, death, who is the key
[p]To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
[p]More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me
[p]The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
[p]Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?
[p]So children temporal fathers do appease;
[p]Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
[p]I cannot do it better than in gyves,
[p]Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,
[p]If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
[p]No stricter render of me than my all.
[p]I know you are more clement than vile men,
[p]Who of their broken debtors take a third,
[p]A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
[p]On their abatement: that's not my desire:
[p]For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
[p]'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:
[p]'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
[p]Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:
[p]You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,
[p]If you will take this audit, take this life,
[p]And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
[p]I'll speak to thee in silence.
[p][Sleeps]
[p][Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition,]
[p]SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus,
[p]an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in
[p]his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother
[p]to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:
[p]then, after other music, follow the two young
[p]Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with
[p]wounds as they died in the wars. They circle
[p]Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping]
"
"No more, thou thunder-master, show
[p]Thy spite on mortal flies:
[p]With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
[p]That thy adulteries
[p]Rates and revenges.
[p]Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
[p]Whose face I never saw?
[p]I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
[p]Attending nature's law:
[p]Whose father then, as men report
[p]Thou orphans' father art,
[p]Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
[p]From this earth-vexing smart.
"
"Lucina lent not me her aid,
[p]But took me in my throes;
[p]That from me was Posthumus ript,
[p]Came crying 'mongst his foes,
[p]A thing of pity!
"
"Great nature, like his ancestry,
[p]Moulded the stuff so fair,
[p]That he deserved the praise o' the world,
[p]As great Sicilius' heir.
"
"When once he was mature for man,
[p]In Britain where was he
[p]That could stand up his parallel;
[p]Or fruitful object be
[p]In eye of Imogen, that best
[p]Could deem his dignity?
"
"With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,
[p]To be exiled, and thrown
[p]From Leonati seat, and cast
[p]From her his dearest one,
[p]Sweet Imogen?
"
"Why did you suffer Iachimo,
[p]Slight thing of Italy,
[p]To taint his nobler heart and brain
[p]With needless jealosy;
[p]And to become the geck and scorn
[p]O' th' other's villany?
"
"For this from stiller seats we came,
[p]Our parents and us twain,
[p]That striking in our country's cause
[p]Fell bravely and were slain,
[p]Our fealty and Tenantius' right
[p]With honour to maintain.
"
"Like hardiment Posthumus hath
[p]To Cymbeline perform'd:
[p]Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
[p]Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
[p]The graces for his merits due,
[p]Being all to dolours turn'd?
"
"Thy crystal window ope; look out;
[p]No longer exercise
[p]Upon a valiant race thy harsh
[p]And potent injuries.
"
"Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
[p]Take off his miseries.
"
"Peep through thy marble mansion; help;
[p]Or we poor ghosts will cry
[p]To the shining synod of the rest
[p]Against thy deity.
"
"[with First Brother] Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,
[p]And from thy justice fly.
[p][Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting]
[p]upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The
[p]Apparitions fall on their knees]
"
"No more, you petty spirits of region low,
[p]Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts
[p]Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,
[p]Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
[p]Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
[p]Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:
[p]Be not with mortal accidents opprest;

[p]Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
[p]The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;
[p]Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:
[p]His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
[p]Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in
[p]Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.
[p]He shall be lord of lady Imogen,
[p]And happier much by his affliction made.
[p]This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
[p]Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:
[p]and so, away: no further with your din
[p]Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
[p]Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.
"
"He came in thunder; his celestial breath
[p]Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle
[p]Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is
[p]More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird
[p]Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
[p]As when his god is pleased.
"
"Thanks, Jupiter!
"
"The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd
[p]His radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,
[p]Let us with care perform his great behest.

"[Waking] Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot
[p]A father to me; and thou hast created
[p]A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
[p]Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
[p]And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
[p]On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
[p]Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:
[p]Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
[p]And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,
[p]That have this golden chance and know not why.
[p]What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
[p]Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment

"
"Come, sir, are you ready for death?
"
"Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.
"
"Hanging is the word, sir: if
[p]you be ready for that, you are well cooked.
"
"So, if I prove a good repast to the
[p]spectators, the dish pays the shot.
"
"A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,
[p]you shall be called to no more payments, fear no
[p]more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of
[p]parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in
[p]flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too
[p]much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and
[p]sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain
[p]both empty; the brain the heavier for being too
[p]light, the purse too light, being drawn of
[p]heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be
[p]quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up
[p]thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and
[p]creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,
[p]the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and
[p]counters; so the acquittance follows.
"
"I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
"
"Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the
[p]tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
[p]sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he
[p]would change places with his officer; for, look you,
[p]sir, you know not which way you shall go.
"
"Yes, indeed do I, fellow.
"
"Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen
[p]him so pictured: you must either be directed by
[p]some that take upon them to know, or do take upon
[p]yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or
[p]jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how
[p]you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll
[p]never return to tell one.
"
"I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to
[p]direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and
[p]will not use them.
"
"What an infinite mock is this, that a man should
[p]have the best use of eyes to see the way of
[p]blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.
"
"Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.
"
"Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.

"I'll be hang'd then.
"
"Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.
"
"Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
[p]gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my
[p]conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,
[p]for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them
[p]too that die against their wills; so should I, if I
[p]were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one
[p]mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and
[p]gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but
[p]my wish hath a preferment in 't.

"Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
[p]Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart

[p]He shall be happy that can find him, if
[p]Our grace can make him so.
"
"I never saw
[p]Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
[p]Such precious deeds in one that promises nought
[p]But beggary and poor looks.

"No tidings of him?

[p]To ask of whence you are. Report it.
"
"Sir,
[p]In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:
[p]Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
[p]Unless I add, we are honest.
"
"Bow your knees.
[p]Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you
[p]Companions to our person and will fit you
[p]With dignities becoming your estates.
[p][Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies]
[p]There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
[p]Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,
[p]And not o' the court of Britain.
"
"Hail, great king!
[p]To sour your happiness, I must report
[p]The queen is dead.
"
"Who worse than a physician
[p]Would this report become? But I consider,
[p]By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death
[p]Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?
"
"With horror, madly dying, like her life,
[p]Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
[p]Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
[p]I will report, so please you: these her women
[p]Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
[p]Were present when she finish'd.
"
"Prithee, say.
"
"First, she confess'd she never loved you, only
[p]Affected greatness got by you, not you:
[p]Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
[p]Abhorr'd your person.
"
"She alone knew this;
[p]And, but she spoke it dying, I would not
[p]Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
"
"Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
[p]With such integrity, she did confess
[p]Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
[p]But that her flight prevented it, she had
[p]Ta'en off by poison.
"
"O most delicate fiend!
[p]Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?
"
"More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
[p]For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,
[p]Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
[p]By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,
[p]By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
[p]O'ercome you with her show, and in time,
[p]When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
[p]Her son into the adoption of the crown:
[p]But, failing of her end by his strange absence,
[p]Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite
[p]Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented
[p]The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so
[p]Despairing died.
"
"Heard you all this, her women?
"
"We did, so please your highness.
"
"Mine eyes
[p]Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
[p]Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,
[p]That thought her like her seeming; it had
[p]been vicious
[p]To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!
[p]That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
[p]And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!
[p][Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other]
[p]Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
[p]behind, and IMOGEN]
[p]Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that
[p]The Britons have razed out, though with the loss
[p]Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit
[p]That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
[p]Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:
[p]So think of your estate.
"
"Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day
[p]Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,
[p]We should not, when the blood was cool,
[p]have threaten'd
[p]Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
[p]Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
[p]May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth
[p]A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:
[p]Augustus lives to think on't: and so much
[p]For my peculiar care. This one thing only
[p]I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,
[p]Let him be ransom'd: never master had
[p]A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
[p]So tender over his occasions, true,
[p]So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join
[p]With my request, which I make bold your highness
[p]Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,
[p]Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,
[p]And spare no blood beside.
"
"I have surely seen him:
[p]His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
[p]Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
[p]And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
[p]To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:
[p]And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
[p]Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;
[p]Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
[p]The noblest ta'en.
"
"I humbly thank your highness.
"
"I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;
[p]And yet I know thou wilt.
"
"No, no: alack,
[p]There's other work in hand: I see a thing
[p]Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,
[p]Must shuffle for itself.
"
"The boy disdains me,
[p]He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
[p]That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
[p]Why stands he so perplex'd?
"
"What wouldst thou, boy?
[p]I love thee more and more: think more and more
[p]What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,
[p]Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?
"
"He is a Roman; no more kin to me
[p]Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,
[p]Am something nearer.
"
"Wherefore eyest him so?
"
"I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
[p]To give me hearing.
"
"Ay, with all my heart,
[p]And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
"
"Fidele, sir.
"
"Thou'rt my good youth, my page;
[p]I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.
"
"Is not this boy revived from death?
"
"One sand another
[p]Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
[p]Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?
"
"The same dead thing alive.
"
"Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;
[p]Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure
[p]He would have spoke to us.
"
"But we saw him dead.
"
"Be silent; let's see further.
"
"[Aside]. It is my mistress:
[p]Since she is living, let the time run on
[p]To good or bad.
"
"Come, stand thou by our side;
[p]Make thy demand aloud.
[p][To IACHIMO]
[p]Sir, step you forth;
[p]Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;
[p]Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
[p]Which is our honour, bitter torture shall
[p]Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.
"
"My boon is, that this gentleman may render
[p]Of whom he had this ring.
"
"[Aside] What's that to him?
"
"That diamond upon your finger, say
[p]How came it yours?
"
"Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
[p]Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.
"
"How! me?
"
"I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
[p]Which torments me to conceal. By villany
[p]I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;
[p]Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may
[p]grieve thee,
[p]As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived
[p]'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
"
"All that belongs to this.
"
"That paragon, thy daughter,--
[p]For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
[p]Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.
"
"My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:
[p]I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
[p]Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.
"
"Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
[p]That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed
[p]The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would
[p]Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
[p]Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--
[p]What should I say? he was too good to be
[p]Where ill men were; and was the best of all
[p]Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,
[p]Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
[p]For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
[p]Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming
[p]The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.
[p]Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,
[p]A shop of all the qualities that man
[p]Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
[p]Fairness which strikes the eye--
"
"I stand on fire:
[p]Come to the matter.
"
"All too soon I shall,
[p]Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
[p]Most like a noble lord in love and one
[p]That had a royal lover, took his hint;
[p]And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein
[p]He was as calm as virtue--he began
[p]His mistress' picture; which by his tongue
[p]being made,
[p]And then a mind put in't, either our brags
[p]Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description
[p]Proved us unspeaking sots.
"
"Nay, nay, to the purpose.
"
"Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
[p]He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
[p]And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,
[p]Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him
[p]Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
[p]Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
[p]In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
[p]By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
[p]No lesser of her honour confident
[p]Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
[p]And would so, had it been a carbuncle
[p]Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
[p]Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
[p]Post I in this design: well may you, sir,
[p]Remember me at court; where I was taught
[p]Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
[p]'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd
[p]Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
[p]'Gan in your duller Britain operate
[p]Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:
[p]And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,
[p]That I return'd with simular proof enough
[p]To make the noble Leonatus mad,
[p]By wounding his belief in her renown
[p]With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
[p]Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--
[p]O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
[p]Of secret on her person, that he could not
[p]But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
[p]I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--
[p]Methinks, I see him now--
"
"[Advancing] Ay, so thou dost,
[p]Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
[p]Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
[p]That's due to all the villains past, in being,
[p]To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
[p]Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out
[p]For torturers ingenious: it is I
[p]That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
[p]By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
[p]That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--
[p]That caused a lesser villain than myself,
[p]A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple
[p]Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
[p]Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
[p]The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain
[p]Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and
[p]Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!
[p]My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
[p]Imogen, Imogen!
"
"Peace, my lord; hear, hear--
"
"Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
[p]There lie thy part.
"
"O, gentlemen, help!
[p]Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!
[p]You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!
[p]Mine honour'd lady!
"
"Does the world go round?
"
"How come these staggers on me?
"
"Wake, my mistress!
"
"If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
[p]To death with mortal joy.
"
"How fares thy mistress?
"
"O, get thee from my sight;
[p]Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!
[p]Breathe not where princes are.
"
"The tune of Imogen!
"
"Lady,
[p]The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
[p]That box I gave you was not thought by me
[p]A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
"
"New matter still?
"
"It poison'd me.
"
"O gods!
[p]I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.
[p]Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
[p]Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection
[p]Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
[p]As I would serve a rat.'
"
"What's this, Comelius?
"
"The queen, sir, very oft importuned me
[p]To temper poisons for her, still pretending
[p]The satisfaction of her knowledge only
[p]In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
[p]Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose
[p]Was of more danger, did compound for her
[p]A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
[p]The present power of life, but in short time
[p]All offices of nature should again
[p]Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
"
"Most like I did, for I was dead.
"
"My boys,
[p]There was our error.
"
"This is, sure, Fidele.
"
"Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
[p]Think that you are upon a rock; and now
[p]Throw me again.
"
"Hang there like a fruit, my soul,
[p]Till the tree die!
"
"How now, my flesh, my child!
[p]What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?
[p]Wilt thou not speak to me?
"
"[Kneeling] Your blessing, sir.
"
"[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love
[p]this youth, I blame ye not:
[p]You had a motive for't.
"
"My tears that fall
[p]Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
[p]Thy mother's dead.
"
"I am sorry for't, my lord.
"
"O, she was nought; and long of her it was
[p]That we meet here so strangely: but her son
[p]Is gone, we know not how nor where.
"
"My lord,
[p]Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
[p]Upon my lady's missing, came to me
[p]With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
[p]If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
[p]It was my instant death. By accident,
[p]had a feigned letter of my master's
[p]Then in my pocket; which directed him
[p]To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
[p]Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
[p]Which he enforced from me, away he posts
[p]With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
[p]My lady's honour: what became of him
[p]I further know not.
"
"Let me end the story:
[p]I slew him there.
"
"Marry, the gods forfend!
[p]I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
[p]Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,
[p]Deny't again.
"
"I have spoke it, and I did it.
"
"He was a prince.
"
"A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
[p]Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
[p]With language that would make me spurn the sea,
[p]If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;
[p]And am right glad he is not standing here
[p]To tell this tale of mine.
"
"I am sorry for thee:
[p]By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
[p]Endure our law: thou'rt dead.
"
"That headless man
[p]I thought had been my lord.
"
"Bind the offender,
[p]And take him from our presence.
"
"Stay, sir king:
[p]This man is better than the man he slew,
[p]As well descended as thyself; and hath
[p]More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
[p]Had ever scar for.
[p][To the Guard]
[p]Let his arms alone;
[p]They were not born for bondage.
"
"Why, old soldier,
[p]Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
[p]By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
[p]As good as we?
"
"In that he spake too far.
"
"And thou shalt die for't.
"
"We will die all three:
[p]But I will prove that two on's are as good
[p]As I have given out him. My sons, I must,
[p]For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,
[p]Though, haply, well for you.
"
"Your danger's ours.
"
"And our good his.
"
"Have at it then, by leave.
[p]Thou hadst, great king, a subject who
[p]Was call'd Belarius.
"
"What of him? he is
[p]A banish'd traitor.
"
"He it is that hath
[p]Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;
[p]I know not how a traitor.
"
"Take him hence:
[p]The whole world shall not save him.
"
"Not too hot:
[p]First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
[p]And let it be confiscate all, so soon
[p]As I have received it.
"
"Nursing of my sons!
"
"I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:
[p]Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
[p]Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
[p]These two young gentlemen, that call me father
[p]And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
[p]They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
[p]And blood of your begetting.
"
"How! my issue!
"
"So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
[p]Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:
[p]Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
[p]Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
[p]Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
[p]For such and so they are--these twenty years
[p]Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
[p]Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
[p]Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
[p]Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
[p]Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,
[p]Having received the punishment before,
[p]For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty
[p]Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
[p]The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
[p]Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
[p]Here are your sons again; and I must lose
[p]Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
[p]The benediction of these covering heavens
[p]Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
[p]To inlay heaven with stars.
"
"Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
[p]The service that you three have done is more
[p]Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:
[p]If these be they, I know not how to wish
[p]A pair of worthier sons.
"
"Be pleased awhile.
[p]This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
[p]Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:
[p]This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
[p]Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
[p]In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
[p]Of his queen mother, which for more probation
[p]I can with ease produce.
"
"Guiderius had
[p]Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
[p]It was a mark of wonder.
"
"This is he;
[p]Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:
[p]It was wise nature's end in the donation,
[p]To be his evidence now.
"
"O, what, am I
[p]A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
[p]Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
[p]That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
[p]may reign in them now! O Imogen,
[p]Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.
"
"No, my lord;
[p]I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,
[p]Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
[p]But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,
[p]When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
[p]When ye were so indeed.
"
"Did you e'er meet?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"And at first meeting loved;
[p]Continued so, until we thought he died.
"
"By the queen's dram she swallow'd.
"
"O rare instinct!
[p]When shall I hear all through? This fierce
[p]abridgement
[p]Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
[p]Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?
[p]And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
[p]How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
[p]Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
[p]And your three motives to the battle, with
[p]I know not how much more, should be demanded;
[p]And all the other by-dependencies,
[p]From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place
[p]Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,
[p]Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
[p]And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
[p]On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting
[p]Each object with a joy: the counterchange
[p]Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
[p]And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
[p][To BELARIUS]
[p]Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.
"
"You are my father too, and did relieve me,
[p]To see this gracious season.
"
"All o'erjoy'd,
[p]Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,
[p]For they shall taste our comfort.
"
"My good master,
[p]I will yet do you service.
"
"Happy be you!
"
"The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
[p]He would have well becomed this place, and graced
[p]The thankings of a king.
"
"I am, sir,
[p]The soldier that did company these three
[p]In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
[p]The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
[p]Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might
[p]Have made you finish.
"
"[Kneeling] I am down again:
[p]But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
[p]As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
[p]Which I so often owe: but your ring first;
[p]And here the bracelet of the truest princess
[p]That ever swore her faith.
"
"Kneel not to me:
[p]The power that I have on you is, to spare you;
[p]The malice towards you to forgive you: live,
[p]And deal with others better.
"
"Nobly doom'd!
[p]We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
[p]Pardon's the word to all.
"
"You holp us, sir,
[p]As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
[p]Joy'd are we that you are.
"
"Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,
[p]Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought
[p]Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
[p]Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
[p]Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
[p]This label on my bosom; whose containing
[p]Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
[p]Make no collection of it: let him show
[p]His skill in the construction.
"
"Philarmonus!
"
"Here, my good lord.
"
"Read, and declare the meaning.
"
"[Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself
[p]unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a
[p]piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar
[p]shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many
[p]years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
[p]stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end
[p]his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in
[p]peace and plenty.'
[p]Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
[p]The fit and apt construction of thy name,
[p]Being Leonatus, doth import so much.
[p][To CYMBELINE]
[p]The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
[p]Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'
[p]We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine
[p]Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
[p]Answering the letter of the oracle,
[p]Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
[p]With this most tender air.
"
"This hath some seeming.
"
"The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
[p]Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point
[p]Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,
[p]For many years thought dead, are now revived,
[p]To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
[p]Promises Britain peace and plenty.
"
"Well
[p]My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
[p]Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
[p]And to the Roman empire; promising
[p]To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
[p]We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
[p]Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
[p]Have laid most heavy hand.
"
"The fingers of the powers above do tune
[p]The harmony of this peace. The vision
[p]Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
[p]Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
[p]Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
[p]From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
[p]Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
[p]So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
[p]The imperial Caesar, should again unite
[p]His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
[p]Which shines here in the west.
"
"Laud we the gods;
[p]And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
[p]From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
[p]To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
[p]A Roman and a British ensign wave
[p]Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:
[p]And in the temple of great Jupiter
[p]Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
[p]Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
[p]Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
"
"Who's there?
"
"Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
"
"Long live the King!
"
"Bernardo?
"
"He.
"
"You come most carefully upon your hour.
"
"'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
"
"For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
[p]And I am sick at heart.
"
"Have you had quiet guard?
"
"Not a mouse stirring.
"
"Well, good night.
[p]If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
[p]The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
"
"I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
"
"Friends to this ground.
"
"And liegemen to the Dane.
"
"Give you good night.
"
"O, farewell, honest soldier.
[p]Who hath reliev'd you?
"
"Bernardo hath my place.
[p]Give you good night.               Exit.
"
"Holla, Bernardo!
"
"Say-
[p]What, is Horatio there ?
"
"A piece of him.
"
"Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
"
"What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
"
"I have seen nothing.
"
"Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
[p]And will not let belief take hold of him
[p]Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
[p]Therefore I have entreated him along, 
[p]With us to watch the minutes of this night,
[p]That, if again this apparition come,
[p]He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
"
"Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
"
"Sit down awhile,
[p]And let us once again assail your ears,
[p]That are so fortified against our story,
[p]What we two nights have seen.
"
"Well, sit we down,
[p]And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
"
"Last night of all,
[p]When yond same star that's westward from the pole
[p]Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
[p]Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
[p]The bell then beating one-
"
"Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
"
"In the same figure, like the King that's dead. 
"
"Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
"
"Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
"
"Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
"
"It would be spoke to.
"
"Question it, Horatio.
"
"What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
[p]Together with that fair and warlike form
[p]In which the majesty of buried Denmark
[p]Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
"
"It is offended.
"
"See, it stalks away!
"
"Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
"
"'Tis gone and will not answer.
"
"How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
[p]Is not this something more than fantasy?
[p]What think you on't?
"
"Before my God, I might not this believe
[p]Without the sensible and true avouch
[p]Of mine own eyes. 
"
"Is it not like the King?
"
"As thou art to thyself.
[p]Such was the very armour he had on
[p]When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
[p]So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
[p]He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
[p]'Tis strange.
"
"Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
[p]With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
"
"In what particular thought to work I know not;
[p]But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
[p]This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
"
"Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
[p]Why this same strict and most observant watch
[p]So nightly toils the subject of the land,
[p]And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
[p]And foreign mart for implements of war;
[p]Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
[p]Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
[p]What might be toward, that this sweaty haste 
[p]Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
[p]Who is't that can inform me?
"
"That can I.
[p]At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
[p]Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
[p]Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
[p]Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
[p]Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
[p](For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
[p]Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
[p]Well ratified by law and heraldry,
[p]Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
[p]Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
[p]Against the which a moiety competent
[p]Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
[p]To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
[p]Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant
[p]And carriage of the article design'd,
[p]His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
[p]Of unimproved mettle hot and full, 
[p]Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
[p]Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
[p]For food and diet, to some enterprise
[p]That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
[p]As it doth well appear unto our state,
[p]But to recover of us, by strong hand
[p]And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
[p]So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
[p]Is the main motive of our preparations,
[p]The source of this our watch, and the chief head
[p]Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
"
"I think it be no other but e'en so.
[p]Well may it sort that this portentous figure
[p]Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
[p]That was and is the question of these wars.
"
"A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
[p]In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
[p]A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
[p]The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
[p]Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; 
[p]As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
[p]Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
[p]Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
[p]Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
[p]And even the like precurse of fierce events,
[p]As harbingers preceding still the fates
[p]And prologue to the omen coming on,
[p]Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
[p]Unto our climature and countrymen.
[p][Enter Ghost again.]
[p]But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
[p]I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
[p][Spreads his arms.]
[p]If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
[p]Speak to me.
[p]If there be any good thing to be done,
[p]That may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,
[p]Speak to me. 
[p]If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
[p]Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
[p]O, speak!
[p]Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
[p]Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
[p](For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
[p][The cock crows.]
[p]Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
"
"Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
"
"Do, if it will not stand.
"
"'Tis here!
"
"'Tis here!
"
"'Tis gone!
[p][Exit Ghost.]
[p]We do it wrong, being so majestical,
[p]To offer it the show of violence;
[p]For it is as the air, invulnerable,
[p]And our vain blows malicious mockery.
"
"It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
"
"And then it started, like a guilty thing 
[p]Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
[p]The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
[p]Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
[p]Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
[p]Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
[p]Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
[p]To his confine; and of the truth herein
[p]This present object made probation.
"
"It faded on the crowing of the cock.
[p]Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
[p]Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
[p]The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
[p]And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
[p]The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
[p]No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
[p]So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
"
"So have I heard and do in part believe it.
[p]But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
[p]Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
[p]Break we our watch up; and by my advice 
[p]Let us impart what we have seen to-night
[p]Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
[p]This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
[p]Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
[p]As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
[p]Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
[p]Where we shall find him most conveniently.
"
"Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
[p]The memory be green, and that it us befitted
[p]To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
[p]To be contracted in one brow of woe,
[p]Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
[p]That we with wisest sorrow think on him
[p]Together with remembrance of ourselves.
[p]Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
[p]Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
[p]Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
[p]With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
[p]With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
[p]In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
[p]Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
[p]Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone 
[p]With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
[p]Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
[p]Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
[p]Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
[p]Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
[p]Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
[p]He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
[p]Importing the surrender of those lands
[p]Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
[p]To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
[p]Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
[p]Thus much the business is: we have here writ
[p]To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
[p]Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
[p]Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
[p]His further gait herein, in that the levies,
[p]The lists, and full proportions are all made
[p]Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
[p]You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
[p]For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, 
[p]Giving to you no further personal power
[p]To business with the King, more than the scope
[p]Of these dilated articles allow.  [Gives a paper.]
[p]Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
"
"[with Voltemand] In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
"
"We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
[p][Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.]
[p]And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
[p]You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
[p]You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
[p]And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
[p]That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
[p]The head is not more native to the heart,
[p]The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
[p]Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
[p]What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
"
"My dread lord,
[p]Your leave and favour to return to France;
[p]From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
[p]To show my duty in your coronation, 
[p]Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
[p]My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
[p]And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
"
"Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
"
"He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
[p]By laboursome petition, and at last
[p]Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
[p]I do beseech you give him leave to go.
"
"Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
[p]And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
[p]But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
"
"[aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
"
"How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
"
"Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
"
"Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
[p]And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
[p]Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
[p]Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
[p]Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
[p]Passing through nature to eternity. 
"
"Ay, madam, it is common.
"
"If it be,
[p]Why seems it so particular with thee?
"
"Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
[p]'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
[p]Nor customary suits of solemn black,
[p]Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
[p]No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
[p]Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
[p]Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
[p]'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
[p]For they are actions that a man might play;
[p]But I have that within which passeth show-
[p]These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
"
"'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
[p]To give these mourning duties to your father;
[p]But you must know, your father lost a father;
[p]That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
[p]In filial obligation for some term
[p]To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever 
[p]In obstinate condolement is a course
[p]Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
[p]It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
[p]A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
[p]An understanding simple and unschool'd;
[p]For what we know must be, and is as common
[p]As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
[p]Why should we in our peevish opposition
[p]Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
[p]A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
[p]To reason most absurd, whose common theme
[p]Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
[p]From the first corse till he that died to-day,
[p]'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
[p]This unprevailing woe, and think of us
[p]As of a father; for let the world take note
[p]You are the most immediate to our throne,
[p]And with no less nobility of love
[p]Than that which dearest father bears his son
[p]Do I impart toward you. For your intent 
[p]In going back to school in Wittenberg,
[p]It is most retrograde to our desire;
[p]And we beseech you, bend you to remain
[p]Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
[p]Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
"
"Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
[p]I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
"
"I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
"
"Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
[p]Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
[p]This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
[p]Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
[p]No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
[p]But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
[p]And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
[p]Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
"
"O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
[p]Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
[p]Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd 
[p]His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
[p]How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
[p]Seem to me all the uses of this world!
[p]Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
[p]That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
[p]Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
[p]But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
[p]So excellent a king, that was to this
[p]Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
[p]That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
[p]Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
[p]Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
[p]As if increase of appetite had grown
[p]By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
[p]Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
[p]A little month, or ere those shoes were old
[p]With which she followed my poor father's body
[p]Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
[p](O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
[p]Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle; 
[p]My father's brother, but no more like my father
[p]Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
[p]Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
[p]Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
[p]She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
[p]With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
[p]It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
[p]But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
"
"Hail to your lordship!
"
"I am glad to see you well.
[p]Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
"
"The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
"
"Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
[p]And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
[p]Marcellus?
"
"My good lord!
"
"I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-
[p]But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
"
"A truant disposition, good my lord.
"
"I would not hear your enemy say so,
[p]Nor shall you do my ear that violence
[p]To make it truster of your own report
[p]Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
[p]But what is your affair in Elsinore?
[p]We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
"
"My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
"
"I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
[p]I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
"
"Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
"
"Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
[p]Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
[p]Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
[p]Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
[p]My father- methinks I see my father.
"
"O, where, my lord?
"
"In my mind's eye, Horatio.
"
"I saw him once. He was a goodly king. 
"
"He was a man, take him for all in all.
[p]I shall not look upon his like again.
"
"My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
"
"Saw? who?
"
"My lord, the King your father.
"
"The King my father?
"
"Season your admiration for a while
[p]With an attent ear, till I may deliver
[p]Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
[p]This marvel to you.
"
"For God's love let me hear!
"
"Two nights together had these gentlemen
[p](Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
[p]In the dead vast and middle of the night
[p]Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
[p]Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
[p]Appears before them and with solemn march
[p]Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
[p]By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
[p]Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd 
[p]Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
[p]Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
[p]In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
[p]And I with them the third night kept the watch;
[p]Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
[p]Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
[p]The apparition comes. I knew your father.
[p]These hands are not more like.
"
"But where was this?
"
"My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
"
"Did you not speak to it?
"
"My lord, I did;
[p]But answer made it none. Yet once methought
[p]It lifted up it head and did address
[p]Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
[p]But even then the morning cock crew loud,
[p]And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
[p]And vanish'd from our sight.
"
"'Tis very strange.
"
"As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; 
[p]And we did think it writ down in our duty
[p]To let you know of it.
"
"Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
[p]Hold you the watch to-night?
"
"[with Bernardo] We do, my lord.
"
"Arm'd, say you?
"
"[with Bernardo] Arm'd, my lord.
"
"From top to toe?
"
"[with Bernardo] My lord, from head to foot.
"
"Then saw you not his face?
"
"O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
"
"What, look'd he frowningly.
"
"A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
"
"Pale or red?
"
"Nay, very pale.
"
"And fix'd his eyes upon you?
"
"Most constantly.
"
"I would I had been there.
"
"It would have much amaz'd you.
"
"Very like, very like. Stay'd it long? 
"
"While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
"
"[with Bernardo] Longer, longer.
"
"Not when I saw't.
"
"His beard was grizzled- no?
"
"It was, as I have seen it in his life,
[p]A sable silver'd.
"
"I will watch to-night.
[p]Perchance 'twill walk again.
"
"I warr'nt it will.
"
"If it assume my noble father's person,
[p]I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
[p]And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
[p]If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
[p]Let it be tenable in your silence still;
[p]And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
[p]Give it an understanding but no tongue.
[p]I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
[p]Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
[p]I'll visit you.
"
"Our duty to your honour. 
"
"Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
[p][Exeunt [all but Hamlet].]
[p]My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
[p]I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
[p]Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
[p]Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
"
"My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
[p]And, sister, as the winds give benefit
[p]And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
[p]But let me hear from you.
"
"Do you doubt that?
"
"For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
[p]Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
[p]A violet in the youth of primy nature,
[p]Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
[p]The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
[p]No more.
"
"No more but so?
"
"Think it no more.
[p]For nature crescent does not grow alone
[p]In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
[p]The inward service of the mind and soul
[p]Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, 
[p]And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
[p]The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
[p]His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
[p]For he himself is subject to his birth.
[p]He may not, as unvalued persons do,
[p]Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
[p]The safety and health of this whole state,
[p]And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
[p]Unto the voice and yielding of that body
[p]Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
[p]It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
[p]As he in his particular act and place
[p]May give his saying deed; which is no further
[p]Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
[p]Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
[p]If with too credent ear you list his songs,
[p]Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
[p]To his unmast'red importunity.
[p]Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
[p]And keep you in the rear of your affection, 
[p]Out of the shot and danger of desire.
[p]The chariest maid is prodigal enough
[p]If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
[p]Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
[p]The canker galls the infants of the spring
[p]Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
[p]And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
[p]Contagious blastments are most imminent.
[p]Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
[p]Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
"
"I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
[p]As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
[p]Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
[p]Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
[p]Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
[p]Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
[p]And recks not his own rede.
"
"O, fear me not!
[p][Enter Polonius. ]
[p]I stay too long. But here my father comes.
[p]A double blessing is a double grace;
[p]Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
"
"Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
[p]The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
[p]And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
[p]And these few precepts in thy memory
[p]Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
[p]Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
[p]Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
[p]Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
[p]Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
[p]But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
[p]Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
[p]Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
[p]Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
[p]Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
[p]Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
[p]Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, 
[p]But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
[p]For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
[p]And they in France of the best rank and station
[p]Are most select and generous, chief in that.
[p]Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
[p]For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
[p]And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
[p]This above all- to thine own self be true,
[p]And it must follow, as the night the day,
[p]Thou canst not then be false to any man.
[p]Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
"
"Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
"
"The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
"
"Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
[p]What I have said to you.
"
"'Tis in my memory lock'd,
[p]And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
"
"Farewell.                      Exit.
"
"What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
"
"So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. 
"
"Marry, well bethought!
[p]'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
[p]Given private time to you, and you yourself
[p]Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
[p]If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
[p]And that in way of caution- I must tell you
[p]You do not understand yourself so clearly
[p]As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
[p]What is between you? Give me up the truth.
"
"He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
[p]Of his affection to me.
"
"Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
[p]Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
[p]Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
"
"I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
"
"Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
[p]That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
[p]Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
[p]Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
[p]Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool. 
"
"My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
[p]In honourable fashion.
"
"Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
"
"And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
[p]With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
"
"Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
[p]When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
[p]Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
[p]Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
[p]Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
[p]You must not take for fire. From this time
[p]Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
[p]Set your entreatments at a higher rate
[p]Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
[p]Believe so much in him, that he is young,
[p]And with a larger tether may he walk
[p]Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
[p]Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
[p]Not of that dye which their investments show,
[p]But mere implorators of unholy suits, 
[p]Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
[p]The better to beguile. This is for all:
[p]I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
[p]Have you so slander any moment leisure
[p]As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
[p]Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
"
"I shall obey, my lord.
"
"The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
"
"It is a nipping and an eager air.
"
"What hour now?
"
"I think it lacks of twelve.
"
"No, it is struck.
"
"Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
[p]Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
[p][A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.]
[p]What does this mean, my lord?
"
"The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
[p]Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
[p]And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
[p]The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
[p]The triumph of his pledge.
"
"Is it a custom?
"
"Ay, marry, is't;
[p]But to my mind, though I am native here 
[p]And to the manner born, it is a custom
[p]More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
[p]This heavy-headed revel east and west
[p]Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
[p]They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
[p]Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
[p]From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
[p]The pith and marrow of our attribute.
[p]So oft it chances in particular men
[p]That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
[p]As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
[p]Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
[p]By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
[p]Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
[p]Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
[p]The form of plausive manners, that these men
[p]Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
[p]Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
[p]Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
[p]As infinite as man may undergo- 
[p]Shall in the general censure take corruption
[p]From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
[p]Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
"
"Look, my lord, it comes!
"
"Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
[p]Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
[p]Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
[p]Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
[p]Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
[p]That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
[p]King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
[p]Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
[p]Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
[p]Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
[p]Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
[p]Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
[p]To cast thee up again. What may this mean 
[p]That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
[p]Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
[p]Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
[p]So horridly to shake our disposition
[p]With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
[p]Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
"
"It beckons you to go away with it,
[p]As if it some impartment did desire
[p]To you alone.
"
"Look with what courteous action
[p]It waves you to a more removed ground.
[p]But do not go with it!
"
"No, by no means!
"
"It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
"
"Do not, my lord!
"
"Why, what should be the fear?
[p]I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
[p]And for my soul, what can it do to that,
[p]Being a thing immortal as itself? 
[p]It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
"
"What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
[p]Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
[p]That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
[p]And there assume some other, horrible form
[p]Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
[p]And draw you into madness? Think of it.
[p]The very place puts toys of desperation,
[p]Without more motive, into every brain
[p]That looks so many fadoms to the sea
[p]And hears it roar beneath.
"
"It waves me still.
[p]Go on. I'll follow thee.
"
"You shall not go, my lord.
"
"Hold off your hands!
"
"Be rul'd. You shall not go.
"
"My fate cries out
[p]And makes each petty artire in this body
[p]As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
[p][Ghost beckons.]
[p]Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
[p]By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
[p]I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
"
"He waxes desperate with imagination.
"
"Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
"
"Have after. To what issue will this come?
"
"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
"
"Heaven will direct it.
"
"Nay, let's follow him.
"
"Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
"
"Mark me.
"
"I will.
"
"My hour is almost come,
[p]When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
[p]Must render up myself.
"
"Alas, poor ghost!
"
"Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
[p]To what I shall unfold.
"
"Speak. I am bound to hear.
"
"So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
"
"What?
"
"I am thy father's spirit,
[p]Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
[p]And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
[p]Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
[p]Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid 
[p]To tell the secrets of my prison house,
[p]I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
[p]Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
[p]Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
[p]Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
[p]And each particular hair to stand on end
[p]Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
[p]But this eternal blazon must not be
[p]To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
[p]If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
"
"O God!
"
"Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
"
"Murther?
"
"Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
[p]But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
"
"Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
[p]As meditation or the thoughts of love,
[p]May sweep to my revenge.
"
"I find thee apt;
[p]And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed 
[p]That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
[p]Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
[p]'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
[p]A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
[p]Is by a forged process of my death
[p]Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
[p]The serpent that did sting thy father's life
[p]Now wears his crown.
"
"O my prophetic soul!
[p]My uncle?
"
"Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
[p]With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
[p]O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
[p]So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
[p]The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
[p]O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
[p]From me, whose love was of that dignity
[p]That it went hand in hand even with the vow
[p]I made to her in marriage, and to decline
[p]Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor 
[p]To those of mine!
[p]But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
[p]Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
[p]So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
[p]Will sate itself in a celestial bed
[p]And prey on garbage.
[p]But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
[p]Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
[p]My custom always of the afternoon,
[p]Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
[p]With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
[p]And in the porches of my ears did pour
[p]The leperous distilment; whose effect
[p]Holds such an enmity with blood of man
[p]That swift as quicksilver it courses through
[p]The natural gates and alleys of the body,
[p]And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
[p]And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
[p]The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
[p]And a most instant tetter bark'd about, 
[p]Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
[p]All my smooth body.
[p]Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
[p]Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
[p]Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
[p]Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
[p]No reckoning made, but sent to my account
[p]With all my imperfections on my head.
"
"O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
"
"If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
[p]Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
[p]A couch for luxury and damned incest.
[p]But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
[p]Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
[p]Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
[p]And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
[p]To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
[p]The glowworm shows the matin to be near
[p]And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
[p]Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.  Exit.
"
"O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
[p]And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
[p]And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
[p]But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
[p]Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
[p]In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
[p]Yea, from the table of my memory
[p]I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
[p]All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
[p]That youth and observation copied there,
[p]And thy commandment all alone shall live
[p]Within the book and volume of my brain,
[p]Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
[p]O most pernicious woman!
[p]O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
[p]My tables! Meet it is I set it down
[p]That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
[p]At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.  [Writes.]
[p]So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
[p]It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.' 
[p]I have sworn't.
"
"[within] My lord, my lord!
"
"Lord Hamlet!
"
"Heaven secure him!
"
"So be it!
"
"Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
"
"Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
"
"How is't, my noble lord?
"
"What news, my lord?
"
"O, wonderful!
"
"Good my lord, tell it.
"
"No, you will reveal it.
"
"Not I, my lord, by heaven!
"
"Nor I, my lord.
"
"How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
[p]But you'll be secret?
"
"[with Horatio] Ay, by heaven, my lord. 
"
"There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
[p]But he's an arrant knave.
"
"There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
[p]To tell us this.
"
"Why, right! You are in the right!
[p]And so, without more circumstance at all,
[p]I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
[p]You, as your business and desires shall point you,
[p]For every man hath business and desire,
[p]Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
[p]Look you, I'll go pray.
"
"These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
"
"I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
[p]Yes, faith, heartily.
"
"There's no offence, my lord.
"
"Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
[p]And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
[p]It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
[p]For your desire to know what is between us,
[p]O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends, 
[p]As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
[p]Give me one poor request.
"
"What is't, my lord? We will.
"
"Never make known what you have seen to-night.
"
"[with Horatio] My lord, we will not.
"
"Nay, but swear't.
"
"In faith,
[p]My lord, not I.
"
"Nor I, my lord- in faith.
"
"Upon my sword.
"
"We have sworn, my lord, already.
"
"Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
"
"Swear.
"
"Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
[p]Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
[p]Consent to swear.
"
"Propose the oath, my lord. 
"
"Never to speak of this that you have seen.
[p]Swear by my sword.
"
"[beneath] Swear.
"
"Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
[p]Come hither, gentlemen,
[p]And lay your hands again upon my sword.
[p]Never to speak of this that you have heard:
[p]Swear by my sword.
"
"[beneath] Swear by his sword.
"
"Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
[p]A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.""
"
"O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
"
"And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
[p]There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
[p]Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
[p]But come!
[p]Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
[p]How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
[p](As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
[p]To put an antic disposition on), 
[p]That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
[p]With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
[p]Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
[p]As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
[p]Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
[p]Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
[p]That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
[p]So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
[p]Swear.
"
"[beneath] Swear.
"
"Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
[p]With all my love I do commend me to you;
[p]And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
[p]May do t' express his love and friending to you,
[p]God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
[p]And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
[p]The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
[p]That ever I was born to set it right!
[p]Nay, come, let's go together. 
"
"Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
"
"I will, my lord.
"
"You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
[p]Before You visit him, to make inquire
[p]Of his behaviour.
"
"My lord, I did intend it.
"
"Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
[p]Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
[p]And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
[p]What company, at what expense; and finding
[p]By this encompassment and drift of question
[p]That they do know my son, come you more nearer
[p]Than your particular demands will touch it.
[p]Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
[p]As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
[p]And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
"
"Ay, very well, my lord. 
"
"'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
[p]But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
[p]Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
[p]What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
[p]As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
[p]But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
[p]As are companions noted and most known
[p]To youth and liberty.
"
"As gaming, my lord.
"
"Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
[p]Drabbing. You may go so far.
"
"My lord, that would dishonour him.
"
"Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
[p]You must not put another scandal on him,
[p]That he is open to incontinency.
[p]That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
[p]That they may seem the taints of liberty,
[p]The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
[p]A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
[p]Of general assault. 
"
"But, my good lord-
"
"Wherefore should you do this?
"
"Ay, my lord,
[p]I would know that.
"
"Marry, sir, here's my drift,
[p]And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
[p]You laying these slight sullies on my son
[p]As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
[p]Mark you,
[p]Your party in converse, him you would sound,
[p]Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
[p]The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
[p]He closes with you in this consequence:
[p]'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
[p]According to the phrase or the addition
[p]Of man and country-
"
"Very good, my lord.
"
"And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
[p]By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
"
"At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and 
[p]gentleman.'
"
"At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
[p]He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
[p]I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
[p]Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
[p]There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
[p]There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
[p]'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
[p]Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
[p]See you now-
[p]Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
[p]And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
[p]With windlasses and with assays of bias,
[p]By indirections find directions out.
[p]So, by my former lecture and advice,
[p]Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
"
"My lord, I have.
"
"God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
"
"Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
"
"Observe his inclination in yourself. 
"
"I shall, my lord.
"
"And let him ply his music.
"
"Well, my lord.
"
"Farewell!
[p][Exit Reynaldo.]
[p][Enter Ophelia.]
[p]How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
"
"O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
"
"With what, i' th' name of God?
"
"My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
[p]Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
[p]No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
[p]Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
[p]Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
[p]And with a look so piteous in purport
[p]As if he had been loosed out of hell
[p]To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
"
"Mad for thy love? 
"
"My lord, I do not know,
[p]But truly I do fear it.
"
"What said he?
"
"He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
[p]Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
[p]And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
[p]He falls to such perusal of my face
[p]As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
[p]At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
[p]And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
[p]He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
[p]As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
[p]And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
[p]And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
[p]He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
[p]For out o' doors he went without their help
[p]And to the last bended their light on me.
"
"Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
[p]This is the very ecstasy of love,
[p]Whose violent property fordoes itself 
[p]And leads the will to desperate undertakings
[p]As oft as any passion under heaven
[p]That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
[p]What, have you given him any hard words of late?
"
"No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
[p]I did repel his letters and denied
[p]His access to me.
"
"That hath made him mad.
[p]I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
[p]I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
[p]And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
[p]By heaven, it is as proper to our age
[p]To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
[p]As it is common for the younger sort
[p]To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
[p]This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
[p]More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
[p]Come.
"
"Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[p]Moreover that we much did long to see you,
[p]The need we have to use you did provoke
[p]Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
[p]Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
[p]Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
[p]Resembles that it was. What it should be,
[p]More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
[p]So much from th' understanding of himself,
[p]I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
[p]That, being of so young days brought up with him,
[p]And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
[p]That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
[p]Some little time; so by your companies
[p]To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
[p]So much as from occasion you may glean, 
[p]Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
[p]That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
"
"Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
[p]And sure I am two men there are not living
[p]To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
[p]To show us so much gentry and good will
[p]As to expend your time with us awhile
[p]For the supply and profit of our hope,
[p]Your visitation shall receive such thanks
[p]As fits a king's remembrance.
"
"Both your Majesties
[p]Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
[p]Put your dread pleasures more into command
[p]Than to entreaty.
"
"But we both obey,
[p]And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
[p]To lay our service freely at your feet,
[p]To be commanded.
"
"Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
"
"Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz. 
[p]And I beseech you instantly to visit
[p]My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
[p]And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
"
"Heavens make our presence and our practices
[p]Pleasant and helpful to him!
"
"Ay, amen!
"
"Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
[p]Are joyfully return'd.
"
"Thou still hast been the father of good news.
"
"Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
[p]I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
[p]Both to my God and to my gracious king;
[p]And I do think- or else this brain of mine
[p]Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
[p]As it hath us'd to do- that I have found 
[p]The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
"
"O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
"
"Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
[p]My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
"
"Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
[p][Exit Polonius.]
[p]He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
[p]The head and source of all your son's distemper.
"
"I doubt it is no other but the main,
[p]His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
"
"Well, we shall sift him.
[p][Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.]
[p]Welcome, my good friends.
[p]Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
"
"Most fair return of greetings and desires.
[p]Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
[p]His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
[p]To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack, 
[p]But better look'd into, he truly found
[p]It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
[p]That so his sickness, age, and impotence
[p]Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
[p]On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
[p]Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
[p]Makes vow before his uncle never more
[p]To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
[p]Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
[p]Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
[p]And his commission to employ those soldiers,
[p]So levied as before, against the Polack;
[p]With an entreaty, herein further shown,
[p][Gives a paper.]
[p]That it might please you to give quiet pass
[p]Through your dominions for this enterprise,
[p]On such regards of safety and allowance
[p]As therein are set down.
"
"It likes us well;
[p]And at our more consider'd time we'll read, 
[p]Answer, and think upon this business.
[p]Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
[p]Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
[p]Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
"
"This business is well ended.
[p]My liege, and madam, to expostulate
[p]What majesty should be, what duty is,
[p]Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
[p]Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
[p]Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
[p]And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
[p]I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
[p]Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
[p]What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
[p]But let that go.
"
"More matter, with less art.
"
"Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
[p]That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
[p]And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
[p]But farewell it, for I will use no art. 
[p]Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
[p]That we find out the cause of this effect-
[p]Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
[p]For this effect defective comes by cause.
[p]Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
[p]Perpend.
[p]I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
[p]Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
[p]Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
[p][Reads] the letter.]
[p]'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,'-
[p]That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile phrase.
[p]But you shall hear. Thus:
[p][Reads.]
[p]'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
"
"Came this from Hamlet to her?
"
"Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful. [Reads.]      
[p]     'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
[p]       Doubt that the sun doth move;
[p]     Doubt truth to be a liar;
[p]       But never doubt I love.
[p] 'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
[p]reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
[p]it. Adieu.
[p] 'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to
[p]him, HAMLET.'
[p]This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
[p]And more above, hath his solicitings,
[p]As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
[p]All given to mine ear.
"
"But how hath she
[p]Receiv'd his love?
"
"What do you think of me?
"
"As of a man faithful and honourable.
"
"I would fain prove so. But what might you think, 
[p]When I had seen this hot love on the wing
[p](As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
[p]Before my daughter told me), what might you,
[p]Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
[p]If I had play'd the desk or table book,
[p]Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
[p]Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
[p]What might you think? No, I went round to work
[p]And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
[p]'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
[p]This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
[p]That she should lock herself from his resort,
[p]Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
[p]Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
[p]And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
[p]Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
[p]Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
[p]Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
[p]Into the madness wherein now he raves,
[p]And all we mourn for. 
"
"Do you think 'tis this?
"
"it may be, very like.
"
"Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
[p]That I have Positively said 'Tis so,'
[p]When it prov'd otherwise.?
"
"Not that I know.
"
"[points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this  be otherwise.
[p]If circumstances lead me, I will find
[p]Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
[p]Within the centre.
"
"How may we try it further?
"
"You know sometimes he walks for hours together
[p]Here in the lobby.
"
"So he does indeed.
"
"At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
[p]Be you and I behind an arras then.
[p]Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
[p]And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
[p]Let me be no assistant for a state, 
[p]But keep a farm and carters.
"
"We will try it.
"
"But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
"
"Away, I do beseech you, both away
[p]I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
[p][Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].]
[p]How does my good Lord Hamlet?
"
"Well, God-a-mercy.
"
"Do you know me, my lord?
"
"Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
"
"Not I, my lord.
"
"Then I would you were so honest a man.
"
"Honest, my lord?
"
"Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
[p]pick'd out of ten thousand.
"
"That's very true, my lord.
"
"For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god 
[p]kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
"
"I have, my lord.
"
"Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
[p]as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
"
"[aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
[p]he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
[p]gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
[p]for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
[p]read, my lord?
"
"Words, words, words.
"
"What is the matter, my lord?
"
"Between who?
"
"I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
"
"Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
[p]have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
[p]purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
[p]plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
[p]sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
[p]not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
[p]should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.
"
"[aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
[p] Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
"
"Into my grave?
"
"Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
[p]his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
[p]reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
[p]will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
[p]him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
[p]my leave of you.
"
"You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
[p]willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
[p]life,
"
"Fare you well, my lord.
"
"These tedious old fools!
"
"You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
"
"[to Polonius] God save you, sir!
"
"My honour'd lord!
"
"My most dear lord!
"
"My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
[p]Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
"
"As the indifferent children of the earth.
"
"Happy in that we are not over-happy.
[p]On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
"
"Nor the soles of her shoe?
"
"Neither, my lord.
"
"Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
[p]favours?
"
"Faith, her privates we.
"
"In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
[p]strumpet. What news ?
"
"None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
"
"Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
[p]question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
[p]deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
[p]hither?
"
"Prison, my lord? 
"
"Denmark's a prison.
"
"Then is the world one.
"
"A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
[p]dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
"
"We think not so, my lord.
"
"Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
[p]or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
"
"Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
[p]mind.
"
"O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
[p]king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
"
"Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
[p]the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
"
"A dream itself is but a shadow.
"
"Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
[p]it is but a shadow's shadow.
"
"Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
[p]heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
[p]fay, I cannot reason.
"
"[with Guildenstern] We'll wait upon you. 
"
"No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
[p]servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
[p]dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
[p]make you at Elsinore?
"
"To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
"
"Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
[p]and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
[p]you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
[p]visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
"
"What should we say, my lord?
"
"Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
[p]there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
[p]have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
[p]have sent for you.
"
"To what end, my lord?
"
"That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
[p]of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
[p]obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
[p]better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
[p]me, whether you were sent for or no. 
"
"[aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
"
"[aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
[p]not off.
"
"My lord, we were sent for.
"
"I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
[p]discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
[p]feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
[p]mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
[p]heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
[p]seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
[p]air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
[p]roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
[p]to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
[p]piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
[p]faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
[p]action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
[p]beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
[p]is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
[p]neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
"
"My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts. 
"
"Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
"
"To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
[p]entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
[p]on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
"
"He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
[p]have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
[p]target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
[p]end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
[p]lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
[p]freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
[p]they?
"
"Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
[p]tragedians of the city.
"
"How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
[p]reputation and profit, was better both ways.
"
"I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
[p]innovation.
"
"Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
[p]city? Are they so follow'd?
"
"No indeed are they not. 
"
"How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
"
"Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
[p]sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
[p]of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These are now
[p]the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
[p]them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
[p]dare scarce come thither.
"
"What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
[p]escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
[p]sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
[p]themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means
[p]are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
[p]against their own succession.
"
"Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
[p]holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
[p]while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
[p]went to cuffs in the question.
"
"Is't possible?
"
"O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
"
"Do the boys carry it away? 
"
"Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
"
"It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
[p]those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
[p]twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
[p]little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
[p]philosophy could find it out.
"
"There are the players.
"
"Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
[p]appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
[p]with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
[p]tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
[p]entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
[p]and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
"
"In what, my dear lord?
"
"I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
[p]know a hawk from a handsaw.
"
"Well be with you, gentlemen!
"
"Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
[p]That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
[p]clouts.
"
"Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
[p]man is twice a child.
"
"I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
[p]You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
"
"My lord, I have news to tell you.
"
"My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome-
"
"The actors are come hither, my lord.
"
"Buzz, buzz!
"
"Upon my honour-
"
"Then came each actor on his ass-
"
"The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
[p]history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
[p]tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene 
[p]individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
[p]Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
[p]the only men.
"
"O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
"
"What treasure had he, my lord?
"
"Why,
[p]    'One fair daughter, and no more,
[p]      The which he loved passing well.'
"
"[aside] Still on my daughter.
"
"Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
"
"If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
[p]love passing well.
"
"Nay, that follows not.
"
"What follows then, my lord?
"
"Why,
[p]      'As by lot, God wot,'
[p] and then, you know,
[p]      'It came to pass, as most like it was.'
[p]The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
[p]where my abridgment comes.
[p][Enter four or five Players.]
[p]You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
[p]well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is
[p]valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
[p]Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
[p]ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
[p]altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
[p]uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
[p]all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
[p]anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
[p]taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
"
"What speech, my good lord?
"
"I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
[p]or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd 
[p]not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I
[p]receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
[p]the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
[p]set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
[p]there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
[p]nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
[p]affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
[p]sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
[p]I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
[p]especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in
[p]your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
[p]     'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
[p]'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
[p]    'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
[p]    Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
[p]    When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
[p]    Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd 
[p]    With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
[p]    Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
[p]    With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
[p]    Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
[p]    That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
[p]    To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
[p]    And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
[p]    With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
[p]    Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
[p]So, proceed you.
"
"Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.
"
"'Anon he finds him,
[p]  Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
[p]  Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
[p]  Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
[p]  Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
[p]  But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword 
[p]  Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
[p]  Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
[p]  Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
[p]  Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
[p]  Which was declining on the milky head
[p]  Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
[p]  So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
[p]  And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
[p]  Did nothing.
[p]  But, as we often see, against some storm,
[p]  A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
[p]  The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
[p]  As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
[p]  Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
[p]  Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
[p]  And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
[p]  On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
[p]  With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
[p]  Now falls on Priam.
[p]  Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods, 
[p]  In general synod take away her power;
[p]  Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
[p]  And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
[p]  As low as to the fiends!
"
"This is too long.
"
"It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
[p]He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
[p]Hecuba.
"
"'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'
"
"'The mobled queen'?
"
"That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
"
"'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames
[p] With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
[p] Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
[p] About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
[p] A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up- 
[p] Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
[p] 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
[p] But if the gods themselves did see her then,
[p] When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
[p] In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
[p] The instant burst of clamour that she made
[p] (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
[p] Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
[p] And passion in the gods.'
"
"Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
[p]eyes. Prithee no more!
"
"'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
[p]Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
[p]hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
[p]chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
[p]bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
"
"My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
"
"God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
[p]desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own 
[p]honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
[p]your bounty. Take them in.
"
"Come, sirs.
"
"Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
[p][Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].]
[p]Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
[p]Gonzago'?
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
[p]speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
[p]insert in't, could you not?
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
[p][Exit First Player.]
[p]My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
[p]Elsinore.
"
"Good my lord!
"
"Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
[p][Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
[p]Now I am alone. 
[p]O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
[p]Is it not monstrous that this player here,
[p]But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
[p]Could force his soul so to his own conceit
[p]That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
[p]Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
[p]A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
[p]With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
[p]For Hecuba!
[p]What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
[p]That he should weep for her? What would he do,
[p]Had he the motive and the cue for passion
[p]That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
[p]And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
[p]Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
[p]Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
[p]The very faculties of eyes and ears.
[p]Yet I,
[p]A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
[p]Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, 
[p]And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
[p]Upon whose property and most dear life
[p]A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
[p]Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
[p]Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
[p]Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
[p]As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
[p]'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
[p]But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
[p]To make oppression bitter, or ere this
[p]I should have fatted all the region kites
[p]With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
[p]Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
[p]O, vengeance!
[p]Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
[p]That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
[p]Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
[p]Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
[p]And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
[p]A scullion! 
[p]Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
[p]That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
[p]Have by the very cunning of the scene
[p]Been struck so to the soul that presently
[p]They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
[p]For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
[p]With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
[p]Play something like the murther of my father
[p]Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
[p]I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
[p]I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
[p]May be a devil; and the devil hath power
[p]T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
[p]Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
[p]As he is very potent with such spirits,
[p]Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
[p]More relative than this. The play's the thing
[p]Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King. Exit.
"
"And can you by no drift of circumstance
[p]Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
[p]Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
[p]With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
"
"He does confess he feels himself distracted,
[p]But from what cause he will by no means speak.
"
"Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
[p]But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
[p]When we would bring him on to some confession
[p]Of his true state.
"
"Did he receive you well?
"
"Most like a gentleman.
"
"But with much forcing of his disposition.
"
"Niggard of question, but of our demands
[p]Most free in his reply.
"
"Did you assay him 
[p]To any pastime?
"
"Madam, it so fell out that certain players
[p]We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
[p]And there did seem in him a kind of joy
[p]To hear of it. They are here about the court,
[p]And, as I think, they have already order
[p]This night to play before him.
"
"'Tis most true;
[p]And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
[p]To hear and see the matter.
"
"With all my heart, and it doth much content me
[p]To hear him so inclin'd.
[p]Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
[p]And drive his purpose on to these delights.
"
"We shall, my lord.
"
"Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
[p]For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
[p]That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
[p]Affront Ophelia. 
[p]Her father and myself (lawful espials)
[p]Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
[p]We may of their encounter frankly judge
[p]And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
[p]If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
[p]That thus he suffers for.
"
"I shall obey you;
[p]And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
[p]That your good beauties be the happy cause
[p]Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
[p]Will bring him to his wonted way again,
[p]To both your honours.
"
"Madam, I wish it may.
"
"Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
[p]We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
[p]That show of such an exercise may colour
[p]Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
[p]'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
[p]And pious action we do sugar o'er 
[p]The Devil himself.
"
"[aside] O, 'tis too true!
[p]How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
[p]The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
[p]Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
[p]Than is my deed to my most painted word.
[p]O heavy burthen!
"
"I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
"
"To be, or not to be- that is the question:
[p]Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
[p]The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
[p]Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
[p]And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
[p]No more; and by a sleep to say we end
[p]The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
[p]That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation 
[p]Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
[p]To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
[p]For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
[p]When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
[p]Must give us pause. There's the respect
[p]That makes calamity of so long life.
[p]For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
[p]Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
[p]The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
[p]The insolence of office, and the spurns
[p]That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
[p]When he himself might his quietus make
[p]With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
[p]To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
[p]But that the dread of something after death-
[p]The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
[p]No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
[p]And makes us rather bear those ills we have
[p]Than fly to others that we know not of?
[p]Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, 
[p]And thus the native hue of resolution
[p]Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
[p]And enterprises of great pith and moment
[p]With this regard their currents turn awry
[p]And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
[p]The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
[p]Be all my sins rememb'red.
"
"Good my lord,
[p]How does your honour for this many a day?
"
"I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
"
"My lord, I have remembrances of yours
[p]That I have longed long to re-deliver.
[p]I pray you, now receive them.
"
"No, not I!
[p]I never gave you aught.
"
"My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
[p]And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
[p]As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
[p]Take these again; for to the noble mind
[p]Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. 
[p]There, my lord.
"
"Ha, ha! Are you honest?
"
"My lord?
"
"Are you fair?
"
"What means your lordship?
"
"That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
[p]discourse to your beauty.
"
"Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
"
"Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
[p]honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
[p]translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
[p]but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
"
"Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
"
"You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
[p]inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
[p]not.
"
"I was the more deceived.
"
"Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
[p]sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
[p]me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. 
[p]I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
[p]beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
[p]them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
[p]do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
[p]believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
[p]father?
"
"At home, my lord.
"
"Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
[p]nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
"
"O, help him, you sweet heavens!
"
"If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
[p]be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
[p]calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
[p]needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
[p]monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
[p]Farewell.
"
"O heavenly powers, restore him!
"
"I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
[p]given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
[p]amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your 
[p]wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
[p]me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
[p]married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
[p]they are. To a nunnery, go.        Exit.
"
"O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
[p]The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
[p]Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
[p]The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
[p]Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
[p]And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
[p]That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
[p]Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
[p]Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
[p]That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
[p]Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
[p]T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
"
"Love? his affections do not that way tend; 
[p]Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
[p]Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
[p]O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
[p]And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
[p]Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
[p]I have in quick determination
[p]Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
[p]For the demand of our neglected tribute.
[p]Haply the seas, and countries different,
[p]With variable objects, shall expel
[p]This something-settled matter in his heart,
[p]Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
[p]From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
"
"It shall do well. But yet do I believe
[p]The origin and commencement of his grief
[p]Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
[p]You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
[p]We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
[p]But if you hold it fit, after the play
[p]Let his queen mother all alone entreat him 
[p]To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
[p]And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
[p]Of all their conference. If she find him not,
[p]To England send him; or confine him where
[p]Your wisdom best shall think.
"
"It shall be so.
[p]Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Exeunt.
"
"Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
[p]trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
[p]players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
[p]not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
[p]gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
[p]whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
[p]temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
[p]soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
[p]tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
[p](for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
[p]shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
[p]Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
"
"I warrant your honour.
"
"Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
[p]tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
[p]this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
[p]nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, 
[p]whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
[p]'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
[p]scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
[p]form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
[p]it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
[p]grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
[p]o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
[p]have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
[p]speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
[p]Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
[p]strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
[p]journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
[p]humanity so abominably.
"
"I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
"
"O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
[p]speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
[p]that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
[p]spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
[p]question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous
[p]and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go 
[p]make you ready.
[p][Exeunt Players.]
[p][Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]
[p]How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
"
"And the Queen too, and that presently.
"
"Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
[p]help to hasten them?
"
"[with Guildenstern] We will, my lord.
"
"What, ho, Horatio!
"
"Here, sweet lord, at your service.
"
"Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
[p]As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
"
"O, my dear lord!
"
"Nay, do not think I flatter;
[p]For what advancement may I hope from thee, 
[p]That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
[p]To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
[p]No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
[p]And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
[p]Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
[p]Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
[p]And could of men distinguish, her election
[p]Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been
[p]As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
[p]A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
[p]Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
[p]Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
[p]That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
[p]To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
[p]That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
[p]In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
[p]As I do thee. Something too much of this I
[p]There is a play to-night before the King.
[p]One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
[p]Which I have told thee, of my father's death. 
[p]I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
[p]Even with the very comment of thy soul
[p]Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
[p]Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
[p]It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
[p]And my imaginations are as foul
[p]As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
[p]For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
[p]And after we will both our judgments join
[p]In censure of his seeming.
"
"Well, my lord.
[p]If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
[p]And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
[p]Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
[p]march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,  Guildenstern, 
[p]and other Lords attendant, with the Guard carrying torches.]
"
"They are coming to the play. I must be idle. 
[p]Get you a place.
"
"How fares our cousin Hamlet?
"
"Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
[p]promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
"
"I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
[p]mine.
"
"No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
[p]i' th' university, you say?
"
"That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
"
"What did you enact?
"
"I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
[p]kill'd me.
"
"It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
[p]the players ready.
"
"Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
"
"Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
"
"No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
"
"[to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
"
"Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
"
"No, my lord.
"
"I mean, my head upon your lap?
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"Do you think I meant country matters?
"
"I think nothing, my lord.
"
"That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
"
"What is, my lord?
"
"Nothing.
"
"You are merry, my lord.
"
"Who, I?
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
[p]For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
[p]within 's two hours.
"
"Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
"
"So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
[p]suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
[p]yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
[p]half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else
[p]shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose
[p]epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
[p][Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.]
[p]Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
[p]him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
[p]unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
[p]neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
[p]him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
[p]crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
[p]leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
[p]passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes,
[p]comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
[p]carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
[p]seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
[p]his love.
"
"What means this, my lord?
"
"Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief. 
"
"Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
"
"We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
[p]they'll tell all.
"
"Will he tell us what this show meant?
"
"Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
[p]show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
"
"You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
[p]Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
[p] Here stooping to your clemency,
[p] We beg your hearing patiently. [Exit.]
"
"Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
"
"'Tis brief, my lord.
"
"As woman's love.
"
"Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
[p] Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
[p] And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
[p] About the world have times twelve thirties been,
[p] Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
[p] Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
"
"So many journeys may the sun and moon
[p] Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
[p] But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
[p] So far from cheer and from your former state.
[p] That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
[p] Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
[p] For women's fear and love holds quantity,
[p] In neither aught, or in extremity.
[p] Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
[p] And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
[p] Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
[p] Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
"
"Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too; 
[p] My operant powers their functions leave to do.
[p] And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
[p] Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
[p] For husband shalt thou-
"
"O, confound the rest!
[p] Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
[p] When second husband let me be accurst!
[p] None wed the second but who killed the first.
"
"[aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
[p]Queen. The instances that second marriage move
[p] Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
[p] A second time I kill my husband dead
[p] When second husband kisses me in bed.
"
"I do believe you think what now you speak;
[p] But what we do determine oft we break.
[p] Purpose is but the slave to memory,
[p] Of violent birth, but poor validity;
[p] Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
[p] But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
[p] Most necessary 'tis that we forget
[p] To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
[p] What to ourselves in passion we propose,
[p] The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
[p] The violence of either grief or joy
[p] Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
[p] Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
[p] Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
[p] This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
[p] That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
[p] For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
[p] Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
[p] The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
[p] The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
[p] And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
[p] For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
[p] And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
[p] Directly seasons him his enemy.
[p] But, orderly to end where I begun,
[p] Our wills and fates do so contrary run
[p] That our devices still are overthrown;
[p] Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
[p] So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
[p] But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
"
"Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
[p] Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
[p] To desperation turn my trust and hope,
[p] An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
[p] Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
[p] Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
[p] Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
[p] If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
"
"If she should break it now!
"
"'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
[p] My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
[p] The tedious day with sleep.
"
"Sleep rock thy brain, 
"
"And never come mischance between us twain!
"
"Madam, how like you this play?
"
"The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
"
"O, but she'll keep her word.
"
"Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
"
"No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
[p]world.
"
"What do you call the play?
"
"'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
[p]image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
[p]his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of
[p]work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
[p]souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our withers
[p]are unwrung.
"
"You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
"
"I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
[p]the puppets dallying.
"
"You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
"
"It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
"
"Still better, and worse.
"
"So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
[p]thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
[p]bellow for revenge.
[p]Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;  Confederate season, else no creature seeing;  Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,  With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,  Thy natural magic and dire property  On wholesome life usurp immediately.
"
"He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago. 
[p]The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
[p]shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
"
"The King rises.
"
"What, frighted with false fire?
"
"How fares my lord?
"
"Give o'er the play.
"
"Give me some light! Away!
"
"Lights, lights, lights!
"
"Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
[p]     The hart ungalled play;
[p]    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
[p]     Thus runs the world away.
[p]Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my
[p]fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my raz'd
[p]shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
"
"Half a share.
"
"A whole one I!
[p]    For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
[p]      This realm dismantled was 
[p]    Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
[p]      A very, very- pajock.
"
"You might have rhym'd.
"
"O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
[p]pound! Didst perceive?
"
"Very well, my lord.
"
"Upon the talk of the poisoning?
"
"I did very well note him.
"
"Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
[p]    For if the King like not the comedy,
[p]    Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
[p]Come, some music!
[p]           Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
"
"Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
"
"Sir, a whole history.
"
"The King, sir-
"
"Ay, sir, what of him?
"
"Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd. 
"
"With drink, sir?
"
"No, my lord; rather with choler.
"
"Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
[p]the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
[p]plunge him into far more choler.
"
"Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
[p]not so wildly from my affair.
"
"I am tame, sir; pronounce.
"
"The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
[p]hath sent me to you.
"
"You are welcome.
"
"Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
[p]If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
[p]your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
[p]shall be the end of my business.
"
"Sir, I cannot.
"
"What, my lord?
"
"Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
[p]answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
[p]my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you 
[p]say-
"
"Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
[p]amazement and admiration.
"
"O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
[p]sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
"
"She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
"
"We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
[p]further trade with us?
"
"My lord, you once did love me.
"
"And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
"
"Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
[p]bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to
[p]your friend.
"
"Sir, I lack advancement.
"
"How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
[p]for your succession in Denmark?
"
"Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
[p]musty.
[p][Enter the Players with recorders. ]
[p]O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
[p]you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
[p]into a toil?
"
"O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
"
"I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
"
"My lord, I cannot.
"
"I pray you.
"
"Believe me, I cannot.
"
"I do beseech you.
"
"I know, no touch of it, my lord.
"
"It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
[p]fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
[p]discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
"
"But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
[p]have not the skill.
"
"Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
[p]would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
[p]pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
[p]lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, 
[p]excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
[p]speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a
[p]pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
[p]you cannot play upon me.
[p][Enter Polonius.]
[p]God bless you, sir!
"
"My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
"
"Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
"
"By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
"
"Methinks it is like a weasel.
"
"It is back'd like a weasel.
"
"Or like a whale.
"
"Very like a whale.
"
"Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
[p]top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
"
"I will say so.                  Exit.
"
"'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
[p][Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
[p]'Tis now the very witching time of night,
[p]When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
[p]Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
[p]And do such bitter business as the day
[p]Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
[p]O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
[p]The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
[p]Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
[p]I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
[p]My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
[p]How in my words somever she be shent,
[p]To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.
"
"I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
[p]To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
[p]I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
[p]And he to England shall along with you.
[p]The terms of our estate may not endure
[p]Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
[p]Out of his lunacies.
"
"We will ourselves provide.
[p]Most holy and religious fear it is
[p]To keep those many many bodies safe
[p]That live and feed upon your Majesty.
"
"The single and peculiar life is bound
[p]With all the strength and armour of the mind
[p]To keep itself from noyance; but much more
[p]That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
[p]The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
[p]Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw 
[p]What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
[p]Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
[p]To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
[p]Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
[p]Each small annexment, petty consequence,
[p]Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
[p]Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
"
"Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
[p]For we will fetters put upon this fear,
[p]Which now goes too free-footed.
"
"[with Guildenstern] We will haste us.
"
"My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
[p]Behind the arras I'll convey myself
[p]To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
[p]And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
[p]'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, 
[p]Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
[p]The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
[p]I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
[p]And tell you what I know.
"
"Thanks, dear my lord.
[p][Exit [Polonius].]
[p]O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
[p]It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
[p]A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
[p]Though inclination be as sharp as will.
[p]My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
[p]And, like a man to double business bound,
[p]I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
[p]And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
[p]Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
[p]Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
[p]To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
[p]But to confront the visage of offence?
[p]And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
[p]To be forestalled ere we come to fall, 
[p]Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
[p]My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
[p]Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
[p]That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
[p]Of those effects for which I did the murther-
[p]My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
[p]May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
[p]In the corrupted currents of this world
[p]Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
[p]And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
[p]Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
[p]There is no shuffling; there the action lies
[p]In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
[p]Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
[p]To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
[p]Try what repentance can. What can it not?
[p]Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
[p]O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
[p]O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
[p]Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay. 
[p]Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
[p]Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
[p]All may be well.              He kneels.
"
"Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
[p]And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
[p]And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
[p]A villain kills my father; and for that,
[p]I, his sole son, do this same villain send
[p]To heaven.
[p]Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
[p]He took my father grossly, full of bread,
[p]With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
[p]And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
[p]But in our circumstance and course of thought,
[p]'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
[p]To take him in the purging of his soul,
[p]When he is fit and seasoned for his passage? 
[p]No.
[p]Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
[p]When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
[p]Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
[p]At gaming, swearing, or about some act
[p]That has no relish of salvation in't-
[p]Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
[p]And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
[p]As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
[p]This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.  Exit.
"
"[rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
[p]Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Exit.
"
"He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
[p]Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
[p]And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
[p]Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
[p]Pray you be round with him.
"
"[within] Mother, mother, mother!
"
"I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
"
"Now, mother, what's the matter?
"
"Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
"
"Mother, you have my father much offended.
"
"Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
"
"Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
"
"Why, how now, Hamlet? 
"
"What's the matter now?
"
"Have you forgot me?
"
"No, by the rood, not so!
[p]You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
[p]And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
"
"Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
"
"Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
[p]You go not till I set you up a glass
[p]Where you may see the inmost part of you.
"
"What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
[p]Help, help, ho!
"
"[behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
"
"[draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
"
"[behind] O, I am slain!
"
"O me, what hast thou done?
"
"Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
"
"O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
"
"A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
[p]As kill a king, and marry with his brother. 
"
"As kill a king?
"
"Ay, lady, it was my word.
[p][Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]
[p]Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
[p]I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
[p]Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
[p]Leave wringing of your hands. Peace! sit you down
[p]And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
[p]If it be made of penetrable stuff;
[p]If damned custom have not braz'd it so
[p]That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
"
"What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
[p]In noise so rude against me?
"
"Such an act
[p]That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
[p]Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
[p]From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
[p]And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
[p]As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
[p]As from the body of contraction plucks 
[p]The very soul, and sweet religion makes
[p]A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
[p]Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
[p]With tristful visage, as against the doom,
[p]Is thought-sick at the act.
"
"Ah me, what act,
[p]That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
"
"Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
[p]The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
[p]See what a grace was seated on this brow;
[p]Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
[p]An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
[p]A station like the herald Mercury
[p]New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
[p]A combination and a form indeed
[p]Where every god did seem to set his seal
[p]To give the world assurance of a man.
[p]This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
[p]Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
[p]Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? 
[p]Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
[p]And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
[p]You cannot call it love; for at your age
[p]The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
[p]And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
[p]Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
[p]Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
[p]Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
[p]Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
[p]But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
[p]To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
[p]That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
[p]Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
[p]Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
[p]Or but a sickly part of one true sense
[p]Could not so mope.
[p]O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
[p]If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
[p]To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
[p]And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame 
[p]When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
[p]Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
[p]And reason panders will.
"
"O Hamlet, speak no more!
[p]Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
[p]And there I see such black and grained spots
[p]As will not leave their tinct.
"
"Nay, but to live
[p]In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
[p]Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
[p]Over the nasty sty!
"
"O, speak to me no more!
[p]These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
[p]No more, sweet Hamlet!
"
"A murtherer and a villain!
[p]A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
[p]Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
[p]A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
[p]That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
[p]And put it in his pocket! 
"
"No more!
"
"A king of shreds and patches!-
[p]Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
[p]You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
"
"Alas, he's mad!
"
"Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
[p]That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
[p]Th' important acting of your dread command?
[p]O, say!
"
"Do not forget. This visitation
[p]Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
[p]But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
[p]O, step between her and her fighting soul
[p]Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
[p]Speak to her, Hamlet.
"
"How is it with you, lady?
"
"Alas, how is't with you, 
[p]That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
[p]And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
[p]Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
[p]And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
[p]Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
[p]Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
[p]Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
[p]Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
"
"On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
[p]His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
[p]Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
[p]Lest with this piteous action you convert
[p]My stern effects. Then what I have to do
[p]Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
"
"To whom do you speak this?
"
"Do you see nothing there?
"
"Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
"
"Nor did you nothing hear?
"
"No, nothing but ourselves.
"
"Why, look you there! Look how it steals away! 
[p]My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
[p]Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
"
"This is the very coinage of your brain.
[p]This bodiless creation ecstasy
[p]Is very cunning in.
"
"Ecstasy?
[p]My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
[p]And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
[p]That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
[p]And I the matter will reword; which madness
[p]Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
[p]Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
[p]That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
[p]It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
[p]Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
[p]Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
[p]Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
[p]And do not spread the compost on the weeds
[p]To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; 
[p]For in the fatness of these pursy times
[p]Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
[p]Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
"
"O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
"
"O, throw away the worser part of it,
[p]And live the purer with the other half,
[p]Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
[p]Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
[p]That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
[p]Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
[p]That to the use of actions fair and good
[p]He likewise gives a frock or livery,
[p]That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
[p]And that shall lend a kind of easiness
[p]To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
[p]For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
[p]And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
[p]With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
[p]And when you are desirous to be blest,
[p]I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord, 
[p]I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
[p]To punish me with this, and this with me,
[p]That I must be their scourge and minister.
[p]I will bestow him, and will answer well
[p]The death I gave him. So again, good night.
[p]I must be cruel, only to be kind;
[p]Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
[p]One word more, good lady.
"
"What shall I do?
"
"Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
[p]Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
[p]Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
[p]And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
[p]Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
[p]Make you to ravel all this matter out,
[p]That I essentially am not in madness,
[p]But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
[p]For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
[p]Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
[p]Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so? 
[p]No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
[p]Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
[p]Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
[p]To try conclusions, in the basket creep
[p]And break your own neck down.
"
"Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
[p]And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
[p]What thou hast said to me.
"
"I must to England; you know that?
"
"Alack,
[p]I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
"
"There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
[p]Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
[p]They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
[p]And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
[p]For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
[p]Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
[p]But I will delve one yard below their mines
[p]And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
[p]When in one line two crafts directly meet. 
[p]This man shall set me packing.
[p]I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
[p]Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
[p]Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
[p]Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
[p]Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
[p]Good night, mother.
"
"There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
[p]You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
[p]Where is your son?
"
"Bestow this place on us a little while.
[p][Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
[p]Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
"
"What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
"
"Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
[p]Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
[p]Behind the arras hearing something stir,
[p]Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
[p]And in this brainish apprehension kills
[p]The unseen good old man.
"
"O heavy deed!
[p]It had been so with us, had we been there.
[p]His liberty is full of threats to all-
[p]To you yourself, to us, to every one. 
[p]Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
[p]It will be laid to us, whose providence
[p]Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
[p]This mad young man. But so much was our love
[p]We would not understand what was most fit,
[p]But, like the owner of a foul disease,
[p]To keep it from divulging, let it feed
[p]Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
"
"To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
[p]O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
[p]Among a mineral of metals base,
[p]Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
"
"O Gertrude, come away!
[p]The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
[p]But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
[p]We must with all our majesty and skill
[p]Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
[p][Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
[p]Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
[p]Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
[p]And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
[p]Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
[p]Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
[p][Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].]
[p]Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
[p]And let them know both what we mean to do
[p]And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
[p]Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
[p]As level as the cannon to his blank,
[p]Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
[p]And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
[p]My soul is full of discord and dismay.
"
"Safely stow'd.
"
"[within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
"
"But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they
"
"What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
"
"Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
"
"Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
[p]And bear it to the chapel.
"
"Do not believe it.
"
"Believe what?
"
"That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
[p]demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
[p]of a king?
"
"Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
"
"Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards, 
[p]his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in
[p]the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
[p]first mouth'd, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have
[p]glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
[p]again.
"
"I understand you not, my lord.
"
"I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
"
"My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
[p]the King.
"
"The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
[p]The King is a thing-
"
"A thing, my lord?
"
"Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
"
"I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
[p]How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
[p]Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
[p]He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
[p]Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
[p]And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
[p]But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
[p]This sudden sending him away must seem
[p]Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
[p]By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
[p]Or not at all.
[p][Enter Rosencrantz.]
[p]How now O What hath befall'n?
"
"Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
[p]We cannot get from him. 
"
"But where is he?
"
"Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
"
"Bring him before us.
"
"Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
"
"Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
"
"At supper.
"
"At supper? Where?
"
"Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
[p]convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
[p]only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
[p]we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
[p]is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's the
[p]end.
"
"Alas, alas!
"
"A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
[p]of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
"
"What dost thou mean by this? 
"
"Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
[p]the guts of a beggar.
"
"Where is Polonius?
"
"In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
[p]there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you
[p]find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
[p]the stair, into the lobby.
"
"Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
"
"He will stay till you come.
"
"Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
[p]Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
[p]For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
[p]With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
[p]The bark is ready and the wind at help,
[p]Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
[p]For England.
"
"For England?
"
"Ay, Hamlet.
"
"Good. 
"
"So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
"
"I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
[p]Farewell, dear mother.
"
"Thy loving father, Hamlet.
"
"My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
[p]one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
"
"Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
[p]Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
[p]Away! for everything is seal'd and done
[p]That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
[p][Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
[p]And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
[p]As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
[p]Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
[p]After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
[p]Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
[p]Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
[p]By letters congruing to that effect,
[p]The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; 
[p]For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
[p]And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
[p]Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. Exit.
"
"Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
[p]Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
[p]Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
[p]Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
[p]If that his Majesty would aught with us,
[p]We shall express our duty in his eye;
[p]And let him know so.
"
"I will do't, my lord.
"
"Go softly on.
"
"Good sir, whose powers are these?
"
"They are of Norway, sir.
"
"How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
"
"Against some part of Poland. 
"
"Who commands them, sir?
"
"The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
"
"Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
[p]Or for some frontier?
"
"Truly to speak, and with no addition,
[p]We go to gain a little patch of ground
[p]That hath in it no profit but the name.
[p]To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
[p]Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
[p]A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
"
"Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
"
"Yes, it is already garrison'd.
"
"Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
[p]Will not debate the question of this straw.
[p]This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
[p]That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
[p]Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
"
"God b' wi' you, sir.         [Exit.]
"
"Will't please you go, my lord?
"
"I'll be with you straight. Go a little before. 
[p][Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
[p]How all occasions do inform against me
[p]And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
[p]If his chief good and market of his time
[p]Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
[p]Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
[p]Looking before and after, gave us not
[p]That capability and godlike reason
[p]To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
[p]Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
[p]Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
[p]A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
[p]And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
[p]Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
[p]Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
[p]To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
[p]Witness this army of such mass and charge,
[p]Led by a delicate and tender prince,
[p]Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
[p]Makes mouths at the invisible event, 
[p]Exposing what is mortal and unsure
[p]To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
[p]Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
[p]Is not to stir without great argument,
[p]But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
[p]When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
[p]That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
[p]Excitements of my reason and my blood,
[p]And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
[p]The imminent death of twenty thousand men
[p]That for a fantasy and trick of fame
[p]Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
[p]Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
[p]Which is not tomb enough and continent
[p]To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
[p]My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.
"
"I will not speak with her.
"
"She is importunate, indeed distract.
[p]Her mood will needs be pitied.
"
"What would she have?
"
"She speaks much of her father; says she hears
[p]There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
[p]Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
[p]That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
[p]Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
[p]The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
[p]And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
[p]Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
[p]Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
[p]Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
"
"'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
[p]Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
"
"Let her come in. 
[p][Exit Gentleman.]
[p][Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
[p]Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
[p]So full of artless jealousy is guilt
[p]It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
"
"Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
"
"How now, Ophelia?
"
"[sings]
[p]    How should I your true-love know
[p]      From another one?
[p]    By his cockle bat and' staff
[p]      And his sandal shoon.
"
"Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
"
"Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
[p](Sings) He is dead and gone, lady, 
[p]        He is dead and gone;
[p]       At his head a grass-green turf,
[p]         At his heels a stone.
[p]O, ho!
"
"Nay, but Ophelia-
"
"Pray you mark.
[p](Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-
"
"Alas, look here, my lord!
"
"[Sings]
[p]      Larded all with sweet flowers;
[p]    Which bewept to the grave did not go
[p]      With true-love showers.
"
"How do you, pretty lady?
"
"Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. 
[p]Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
[p]your table!
"
"Conceit upon her father.
"
"Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
[p]it means, say you this:
[p](Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
[p]         All in the morning bedtime,
[p]       And I a maid at your window,
[p]         To be your Valentine.
[p]       Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
[p]         And dupp'd the chamber door,
[p]       Let in the maid, that out a maid
[p]         Never departed more.
"
"Pretty Ophelia!
"
"Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
[p][Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity, 
[p]         Alack, and fie for shame!
[p]       Young men will do't if they come to't
[p]         By Cock, they are to blame.
[p]       Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
[p]         You promis'd me to wed.'
[p]He answers:
[p]       'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
[p]         An thou hadst not come to my bed.'
"
"How long hath she been thus?
"
"I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
[p]choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground.
[p]My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
[p]counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet
[p]ladies. Good night, good night.     Exit
"
"Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
[p][Exit Horatio.]
[p]O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
[p]All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
[p]When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
[p]But in battalions! First, her father slain;
[p]Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
[p]Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
[p]Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
[p]For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
[p]In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
[p]Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
[p]Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
[p]Last, and as much containing as all these,
[p]Her brother is in secret come from France;
[p]Feeds on his wonder, keeps, himself in clouds,
[p]And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
[p]With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
[p]Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
[p]Will nothing stick our person to arraign
[p]In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
[p]Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places 
[p]Give me superfluous death.  A noise within.
"
"Alack, what noise is this?
"
"Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
[p][Enter a Messenger.]
[p]What is the matter?
"
"Save Yourself, my lord:
[p]The ocean, overpeering of his list,
[p]Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
[p]Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
[p]O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
[p]And, as the world were now but to begin,
[p]Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
[p]The ratifiers and props of every word,
[p]They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
[p]Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
[p]'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
"
"How cheerfully on the false trail they cry! 
[p]O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
"
"The doors are broke.
"
"Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
"
"No, let's come in!
"
"I pray you give me leave.
"
"We will, we will!
"
"I thank you. Keep the door.  [Exeunt his Followers.]
[p]O thou vile king,
[p]Give me my father!
"
"Calmly, good Laertes.
"
"That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
[p]Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
[p]Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
[p]Of my true mother.
"
"What is the cause, Laertes,
[p]That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
[p]Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person. 
[p]There's such divinity doth hedge a king
[p]That treason can but peep to what it would,
[p]Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
[p]Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
[p]Speak, man.
"
"Where is my father?
"
"Dead.
"
"But not by him!
"
"Let him demand his fill.
"
"How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
[p]To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
[p]Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
[p]I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
[p]That both the world, I give to negligence,
[p]Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
[p]Most throughly for my father.
"
"Who shall stay you?
"
"My will, not all the world!
[p]And for my means, I'll husband them so well
[p]They shall go far with little. 
"
"Good Laertes,
[p]If you desire to know the certainty
[p]Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
[p]That sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe,
[p]Winner and loser?
"
"None but his enemies.
"
"Will you know them then?
"
"To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
[p]And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
[p]Repast them with my blood.
"
"Why, now You speak
[p]Like a good child and a true gentleman.
[p]That I am guiltless of your father's death,
[p]And am most sensibly in grief for it,
[p]It shall as level to your judgment pierce
[p]As day does to your eye.
"
"How now? What noise is that?
[p][Enter Ophelia. ]
[p]O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
[p]Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
[p]By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
[p]Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
[p]Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
[p]O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
[p]Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
[p]Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
[p]It sends some precious instance of itself
[p]After the thing it loves.
"
"[sings]
[p]    They bore him barefac'd on the bier
[p]      (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
[p]    And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
[p]Fare you well, my dove!
"
"Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
[p]It could not move thus. 
"
"You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
[p]how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
[p]master's daughter.
"
"This nothing's more than matter.
"
"There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
[p]remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
"
"A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
"
"There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
[p]and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.
[p]O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
[p]would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father
[p]died. They say he made a good end.
[p][Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
"
"Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
[p]She turns to favour and to prettiness.
"
"[sings]
[p]    And will he not come again?
[p]    And will he not come again?
[p]      No, no, he is dead; 
[p]      Go to thy deathbed;
[p]    He never will come again.
[p]    His beard was as white as snow,
[p]    All flaxen was his poll.
[p]      He is gone, he is gone,
[p]      And we cast away moan.
[p]    God 'a'mercy on his soul!
[p]And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.
"
"Do you see this, O God?
"
"Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
[p]Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
[p]Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
[p]And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
[p]If by direct or by collateral hand
[p]They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
[p]Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
[p]To you in satisfaction; but if not, 
[p]Be you content to lend your patience to us,
[p]And we shall jointly labour with your soul
[p]To give it due content.
"
"Let this be so.
[p]His means of death, his obscure funeral-
[p]No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
[p]No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
[p]Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
[p]That I must call't in question.
"
"So you shall;
[p]And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
[p]I pray you go with me.
"
"What are they that would speak with me?
"
"Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
"
"Let them come in.
[p][Exit Attendant.]
[p]I do not know from what part of the world
[p]I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
"
"God bless you, sir.
"
"Let him bless thee too.
"
"'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
[p]sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for England- if
[p]your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
"
"[reads the letter] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
[p]this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
[p]letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
[p]very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
[p]slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
[p]boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
[p]alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
[p]of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for
[p]them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou
[p]to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
[p]to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
[p]light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
[p]thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
[p]for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
[p]'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
[p]Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
[p]And do't the speedier that you may direct me
[p]To him from whom you brought them. Exeunt.
"
"Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
[p]And You must put me in your heart for friend,
[p]Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
[p]That he which hath your noble father slain
[p]Pursued my life.
"
"It well appears. But tell me
[p]Why you proceeded not against these feats
[p]So crimeful and so capital in nature,
[p]As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
[p]You mainly were stirr'd up.
"
"O, for two special reasons,
[p]Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
[p]But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
[p]Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
[p]My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
[p]She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
[p]That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, 
[p]I could not but by her. The other motive
[p]Why to a public count I might not go
[p]Is the great love the general gender bear him,
[p]Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
[p]Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
[p]Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
[p]Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
[p]Would have reverted to my bow again,
[p]And not where I had aim'd them.
"
"And so have I a noble father lost;
[p]A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
[p]Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
[p]Stood challenger on mount of all the age
[p]For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
"
"Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
[p]That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
[p]That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
[p]And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
[p]I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
[p]And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine- 
[p][Enter a Messenger with letters.]
[p]How now? What news?
"
"Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
[p]This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
"
"From Hamlet? Who brought them?
"
"Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
[p]They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
[p]Of him that brought them.
"
"Laertes, you shall hear them.
[p]Leave us.
[p][Exit Messenger.]
[p][Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on your
[p]kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
[p]when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
[p]occasion of my sudden and more strange return.                             'HAMLET.'
[p]What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
[p]Or is it some abuse, and no such thing? 
"
"Know you the hand?
"
"'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
[p]And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
[p]Can you advise me?
"
"I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
[p]It warms the very sickness in my heart
[p]That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
[p]'Thus didest thou.'
"
"If it be so, Laertes
[p](As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
[p]Will you be rul'd by me?
"
"Ay my lord,
[p]So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
"
"To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
[p]As checking at his voyage, and that he means
[p]No more to undertake it, I will work him
[p]To exploit now ripe in my device,
[p]Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
[p]And for his death no wind shall breathe
[p]But even his mother shall uncharge the practice 
[p]And call it accident.
"
"My lord, I will be rul'd;
[p]The rather, if you could devise it so
[p]That I might be the organ.
"
"It falls right.
[p]You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
[p]And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
[p]Wherein they say you shine, Your sum of parts
[p]Did not together pluck such envy from him
[p]As did that one; and that, in my regard,
[p]Of the unworthiest siege.
"
"What part is that, my lord?
"
"A very riband in the cap of youth-
[p]Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
[p]The light and careless livery that it wears
[p]Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
[p]Importing health and graveness. Two months since
[p]Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
[p]I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
[p]And they can well on horseback; but this gallant 
[p]Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
[p]And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
[p]As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
[p]With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
[p]That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
[p]Come short of what he did.
"
"A Norman was't?
"
"A Norman.
"
"Upon my life, Lamound.
"
"The very same.
"
"I know him well. He is the broach indeed
[p]And gem of all the nation.
"
"He made confession of you;
[p]And gave you such a masterly report
[p]For art and exercise in your defence,
[p]And for your rapier most especially,
[p]That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
[p]If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
[p]He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
[p]If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his 
[p]Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
[p]That he could nothing do but wish and beg
[p]Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
[p]Now, out of this-
"
"What out of this, my lord?
"
"Laertes, was your father dear to you?
[p]Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
[p]A face without a heart,'
"
"Why ask you this?
"
"Not that I think you did not love your father;
[p]But that I know love is begun by time,
[p]And that I see, in passages of proof,
[p]Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
[p]There lives within the very flame of love
[p]A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
[p]And nothing is at a like goodness still;
[p]For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
[p]Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
[p]We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
[p]And hath abatements and delays as many 
[p]As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
[p]And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
[p]That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
[p]Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
[p]To show yourself your father's son in deed
[p]More than in words?
"
"To cut his throat i' th' church!
"
"No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
[p]Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
[p]Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
[p]Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home.
[p]We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
[p]And set a double varnish on the fame
[p]The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
[p]And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
[p]Most generous, and free from all contriving,
[p]Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
[p]Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
[p]A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
[p]Requite him for your father. 
"
"I will do't!
[p]And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
[p]I bought an unction of a mountebank,
[p]So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
[p]Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
[p]Collected from all simples that have virtue
[p]Under the moon, can save the thing from death
[p]This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
[p]With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
[p]It may be death.
"
"Let's further think of this,
[p]Weigh what convenience both of time and means
[p]May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
[p]And that our drift look through our bad performance.
[p]'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
[p]Should have a back or second, that might hold
[p]If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
[p]We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
[p]I ha't!
[p]When in your motion you are hot and dry- 
[p]As make your bouts more violent to that end-
[p]And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
[p]A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
[p]If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
[p]Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,
[p][Enter Queen.]
[p]How now, sweet queen?
"
"One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
[p]So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
"
"Drown'd! O, where?
"
"There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
[p]That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
[p]There with fantastic garlands did she come
[p]Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
[p]That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
[p]But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
[p]There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
[p]Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke, 
[p]When down her weedy trophies and herself
[p]Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
[p]And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
[p]Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
[p]As one incapable of her own distress,
[p]Or like a creature native and indued
[p]Unto that element; but long it could not be
[p]Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
[p]Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
[p]To muddy death.
"
"Alas, then she is drown'd?
"
"Drown'd, drown'd.
"
"Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
[p]And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
[p]It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
[p]Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
[p]The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
[p]I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
[p]But that this folly douts it.      Exit.
"
"Let's follow, Gertrude. 
[p]How much I had to do to calm his rage I
[p]Now fear I this will give it start again;
[p]Therefore let's follow.
"
"Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully seeks her own salvation?
"
"I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
[p]The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
"
"How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
[p]defence?
"
"Why, 'tis found so.
"
"It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
[p]the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an
[p]act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
[p]argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
"
"Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
"
"Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the
[p]man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
[p]will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
[p]him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
[p]guilty of his own death shortens not his own life. 
"
"But is this law?
"
"Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
"
"Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
[p]gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
"
"Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk
[p]should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves
[p]more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade! There is no
[p]ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They
[p]hold up Adam's profession.
"
"Was he a gentleman?
"
"'A was the first that ever bore arms.
"
"Why, he had none.
"
"What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
[p]The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
[p]put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
[p]purpose, confess thyself-
"
"Go to!
"
"What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
[p]shipwright, or the carpenter?
"
"The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand 
[p]tenants.
"
"I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.
[p]But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
[p]thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
[p]church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!
"
"Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
[p]carpenter?
"
"Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
"
"Marry, now I can tell!
"
"To't.
"
"Mass, I cannot tell.
"
"Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
[p]not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
[p]question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
[p]till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
[p]liquor.
"
"In youth when I did love, did love,
[p]   Methought it was very sweet;
[p]  To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
[p]    O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
"
"Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
[p]grave-making?
"
"Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
"
"'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
[p]sense.
"
"[sings]
[p]    But age with his stealing steps
[p]      Hath clawed me in his clutch,
[p]    And hath shipped me intil the land,
[p]      As if I had never been such.
"
"That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
[p]knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
[p]did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician,
[p]which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
[p]might it not?
"
"It might, my lord.
"
"Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
[p]How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that
[p]prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it- might
[p]it not?
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
[p]about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
[p]and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
[p]breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
[p]on't.
"
"[Sings]
[p]    A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
[p]      For and a shrouding sheet;
[p]    O, a Pit of clay for to be made 
[p]      For such a guest is meet.
[p]                                 Throws up [another skull].
"
"There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
[p]Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
[p]and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
[p]him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
[p]of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
[p]great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
[p]fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
[p]his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
[p]pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
[p]his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
[p]of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
[p]scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no
[p]more, ha?
"
"Not a jot more, my lord.
"
"Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
"
"Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
"
"They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I 
[p]will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
"
"Mine, sir.
[p][Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
[p]         For such a guest is meet.
"
"I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
"
"You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
[p]For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
"
"Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
[p]the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
"
"'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
"
"What man dost thou dig it for?
"
"For no man, sir.
"
"What woman then?
"
"For none neither.
"
"Who is to be buried in't?
"
"One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
"
"How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
[p]equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years
[p]I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe 
[p]of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
[p]his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
"
"Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our
[p]last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
"
"How long is that since?
"
"Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the
[p]very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
[p]into England.
"
"Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
"
"Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits there;
[p]or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
"
"Why?
"
"'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as mad as
[p]he.
"
"How came he mad?
"
"Very strangely, they say.
"
"How strangely?
"
"Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
"
"Upon what ground?
"
"Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy 
[p]thirty years.
"
"How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
"
"Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many
[p]pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in, I
[p]will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
[p]you nine year.
"
"Why he more than another?
"
"Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
[p]keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
[p]your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien
[p]you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
"
"Whose was it?
"
"A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?
"
"Nay, I know not.
"
"A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon of
[p]Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
[p]skull, the King's jester.
"
"This?
"
"E'en that.
"
"Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, 
[p]Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
[p]hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how abhorred
[p]in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
[p]lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
[p]now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
[p]were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
[p]own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
[p]chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
[p]favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,
[p]tell me one thing.
"
"What's that, my lord?
"
"Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
"
"E'en so.
"
"And smelt so? Pah!
"
"E'en so, my lord.
"
"To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
[p]imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
[p]stopping a bunghole?
"
"'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so. 
"
"No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
[p]enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
[p]Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
[p]earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he
[p]was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?
[p]Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
[p]Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
[p]O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
[p]Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
[p]But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
[p]Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
[p][Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]
[p]The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
[p]And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
[p]The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
[p]Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
[p]Couch we awhile, and mark.
"
"What ceremony else?
"
"That is Laertes,
[p]A very noble youth. Mark.
"
"What ceremony else?
"
"Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
[p]As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
[p]And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
[p]She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
[p]Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
[p]Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
[p]Yet here she is allow'd her virgin rites,
[p]Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
[p]Of bell and burial.
"
"Must there no more be done?
"
"No more be done.
[p]We should profane the service of the dead
[p]To sing a requiem and such rest to her
[p]As to peace-parted souls.
"
"Lay her i' th' earth;
[p]And from her fair and unpolluted flesh 
[p]May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
[p]A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
[p]When thou liest howling.
"
"What, the fair Ophelia?
"
"Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
[p][Scatters flowers.]
[p]I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
[p]I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
[p]And not have strew'd thy grave.
"
"O, treble woe
[p]Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
[p]Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
[p]Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
[p]Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
[p][Leaps in the grave.]
[p]Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
[p]Till of this flat a mountain you have made
[p]T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
[p]Of blue Olympus.
"
"[comes forward] What is he whose grief 
[p]Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
[p]Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
[p]Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
[p]Hamlet the Dane.  [Leaps in after Laertes.]
"
"The devil take thy soul!
"
"Thou pray'st not well.
[p]I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
[p]For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
[p]Yet have I in me something dangerous,
[p]Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
"
"Pluck them asunder.
"
"Hamlet, Hamlet!
"
"Gentlemen!
"
"Good my lord, be quiet.
"
"Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
[p]Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
"
"O my son, what theme? 
"
"I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
[p]Could not (with all their quantity of love)
[p]Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
"
"O, he is mad, Laertes.
"
"For love of God, forbear him!
"
"'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
[p]Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
[p]Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
[p]I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
[p]To outface me with leaping in her grave?
[p]Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
[p]And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
[p]Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
[p]Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
[p]Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
[p]I'll rant as well as thou.
"
"This is mere madness;
[p]And thus a while the fit will work on him.
[p]Anon, as patient as the female dove
[p]When that her golden couplets are disclos'd, 
[p]His silence will sit drooping.
"
"Hear you, sir!
[p]What is the reason that you use me thus?
[p]I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
[p]Let Hercules himself do what he may,
[p]The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
"
"I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
[p][Exit Horatio.]
[p][To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech.
[p]We'll put the matter to the present push.-
[p]Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
[p]This grave shall have a living monument.
[p]An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
[p]Till then in patience our proceeding be.
"
"So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
[p]You do remember all the circumstance?
"
"Remember it, my lord!
"
"Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
[p]That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
[p]Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
[p]And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
[p]Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
[p]When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
[p]There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
[p]Rough-hew them how we will-
"
"That is most certain.
"
"Up from my cabin,
[p]My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
[p]Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
[p]Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
[p]To mine own room again; making so bold 
[p](My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
[p]Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
[p](O royal knavery!), an exact command,
[p]Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
[p]Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
[p]With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
[p]That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
[p]No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
[p]My head should be struck off.
"
"Is't possible?
"
"Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
[p]But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
"
"I beseech you.
"
"Being thus benetted round with villanies,
[p]Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
[p]They had begun the play. I sat me down;
[p]Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
[p]I once did hold it, as our statists do,
[p]A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
[p]How to forget that learning; but, sir, now 
[p]It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
[p]Th' effect of what I wrote?
"
"Ay, good my lord.
"
"An earnest conjuration from the King,
[p]As England was his faithful tributary,
[p]As love between them like the palm might flourish,
[p]As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
[p]And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
[p]And many such-like as's of great charge,
[p]That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
[p]Without debatement further, more or less,
[p]He should the bearers put to sudden death,
[p]Not shriving time allow'd.
"
"How was this seal'd?
"
"Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
[p]I had my father's signet in my purse,
[p]Which was the model of that Danish seal;
[p]Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
[p]Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
[p]The changeling never known. Now, the next day 
[p]Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
[p]Thou know'st already.
"
"So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
"
"Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
[p]They are not near my conscience; their defeat
[p]Does by their own insinuation grow.
[p]'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
[p]Between the pass and fell incensed points
[p]Of mighty opposites.
"
"Why, what a king is this!
"
"Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
[p]He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
[p]Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
[p]Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
[p]And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
[p]To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
[p]To let this canker of our nature come
[p]In further evil?
"
"It must be shortly known to him from England
[p]What is the issue of the business there. 
"
"It will be short; the interim is mine,
[p]And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
[p]But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
[p]That to Laertes I forgot myself,
[p]For by the image of my cause I see
[p]The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
[p]But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
[p]Into a tow'ring passion.
"
"Peace! Who comes here?
"
"Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
"
"I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
[p]waterfly?
"
"[aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
"
"[aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
[p]vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
[p]lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis
[p]a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
"
"Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
[p]a thing to you from his Majesty.
"
"I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
[p]bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
"
"I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
"
"No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
"
"It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
"
"But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
"
"Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
[p]tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that
[p]he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-
"
"I beseech you remember.
"
"Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
[p]newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,
[p]full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
[p]great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
[p]or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of
[p]what part a gentleman would see.
"
"Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I
[p]know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
[p]memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
[p]But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
[p]article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
[p]true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
"
"Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
"
"The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
[p]rawer breath?
"
"Sir?
"
"[aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
[p]tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
"
"What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
"
"Of Laertes?
"
"[aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
[p]spent.
"
"Of him, sir.
"
"I know you are not ignorant-
"
"I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
[p]much approve me. Well, sir? 
"
"You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
"
"I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
[p]excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
"
"I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
[p]by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
"
"What's his weapon?
"
"Rapier and dagger.
"
"That's two of his weapons- but well.
"
"The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
[p]against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French
[p]rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
[p]so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
[p]very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
[p]very liberal conceit.
"
"What call you the carriages?
"
"[aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
[p]ere you had done.
"
"The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
"
"The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
[p]carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. 
[p]But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
[p]assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French
[p]bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
"
"The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
[p]yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
[p]laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
[p]if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
"
"How if I answer no?
"
"I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
"
"Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
[p]it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
[p]brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,
[p]I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
[p]shame and the odd hits.
"
"Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
"
"To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
"
"I commend my duty to your lordship.
"
"Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
[p]himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
"
"This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head. 
"
"He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
[p]and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
[p]on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-
[p]a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
[p]through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
[p]them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
"
"My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
[p]brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
[p]know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
[p]take longer time.
"
"I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
[p]If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
[p]I be so able as now.
"
"The King and Queen and all are coming down.
"
"In happy time.
"
"The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
[p]Laertes before you fall to play. 
"
"She well instructs me.
"
"You will lose this wager, my lord.
"
"I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
[p]continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
[p]think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
"
"Nay, good my lord--
"
"It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
[p]would perhaps trouble a woman.
"
"If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
[p]repair hither and say you are not fit.
"
"Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
[p]the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be
[p]not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
[p]the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,
[p]what is't to leave betimes? Let be.
"
"Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
"
"Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
[p]But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
[p]This presence knows,
[p]And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
[p]With sore distraction. What I have done
[p]That might your nature, honour, and exception
[p]Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
[p]Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
[p]If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
[p]And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
[p]Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
[p]Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
[p]Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
[p]His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
[p]Sir, in this audience,
[p]Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
[p]Free me so far in your most generous thoughts 
[p]That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
[p]And hurt my brother.
"
"I am satisfied in nature,
[p]Whose motive in this case should stir me most
[p]To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
[p]I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
[p]Till by some elder masters of known honour
[p]I have a voice and precedent of peace
[p]To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
[p]I do receive your offer'd love like love,
[p]And will not wrong it.
"
"I embrace it freely,
[p]And will this brother's wager frankly play.
[p]Give us the foils. Come on.
"
"Come, one for me.
"
"I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
[p]Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
[p]Stick fiery off indeed.
"
"You mock me, sir.
"
"No, by this hand. 
"
"Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
[p]You know the wager?
"
"Very well, my lord.
[p]Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
"
"I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
[p]But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
"
"This is too heavy; let me see another.
"
"This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
[p]If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
[p]Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
[p]Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
[p]The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
[p]And in the cup an union shall he throw
[p]Richer than that which four successive kings
[p]In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
[p]And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
[p]The trumpet to the cannoneer without, 
[p]The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
[p]'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
[p]And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
"
"Come on, sir.
"
"Come, my lord.            They play.
"
"One.
"
"No.
"
"Judgment!
"
"A hit, a very palpable hit.
"
"Well, again!
"
"Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
[p]Here's to thy health.
[p][Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].]
[p]Give him the cup.
"
"I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
[p]Come. [They play.] Another hit. What say you?
"
"A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
"
"Our son shall win.
"
"He's fat, and scant of breath.
[p]Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows. 
[p]The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
"
"Good madam!
"
"Gertrude, do not drink.
"
"I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.  Drinks.
"
"[aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
"
"I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
"
"Come, let me wipe thy face.
"
"My lord, I'll hit him now.
"
"I do not think't.
"
"[aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
"
"Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
[p]Pray you pass with your best violence;
[p]I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
"
"Say you so? Come on.           Play.
"
"Nothing neither way.
"
"Have at you now!
"
"Part them! They are incens'd.
"
"Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.
"
"Look to the Queen there, ho!
"
"They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
"
"How is't, Laertes?
"
"Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
"
"How does the Queen?
"
"She sounds to see them bleed.
"
"No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
[p]The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. [Dies.]
"
"O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
[p]Treachery! Seek it out.
"
"It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
[p]No medicine in the world can do thee good.
[p]In thee there is not half an hour of life.
[p]The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
[p]Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
[p]Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
[p]Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
[p]I can no more. The King, the King's to blame. 
"
"The point envenom'd too?
[p]Then, venom, to thy work.  Hurts the King.
"
"Treason! treason!
"
"O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
"
"Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
[p]Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
[p]Follow my mother.             King dies.
"
"He is justly serv'd.
[p]It is a poison temper'd by himself.
[p]Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
[p]Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
[p]Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
"
"Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
[p]I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
[p]You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
[p]That are but mutes or audience to this act,
[p]Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
[p]Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
[p]But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
[p]Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright 
[p]To the unsatisfied.
"
"Never believe it.
[p]I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
[p]Here's yet some liquor left.
"
"As th'art a man,
[p]Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
[p]O good Horatio, what a wounded name
[p](Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
[p]If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
[p]Absent thee from felicity awhile,
[p]And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
[p]To tell my story. [March afar off, and shot within.]
[p]What warlike noise is this?
"
"Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
[p]To the ambassadors of England gives
[p]This warlike volley.
"
"O, I die, Horatio!
[p]The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
[p]I cannot live to hear the news from England,
[p]But I do prophesy th' election lights 
[p]On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
[p]So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
[p]Which have solicited- the rest is silence. Dies.
"
"Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
[p]And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
[p][March within.]
[p]Why does the drum come hither?
[p]Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum, Colours, and Attendants.
"
"Where is this sight?
"
"What is it you will see?
[p]If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
"
"This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
[p]What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
[p]That thou so many princes at a shot
[p]So bloodily hast struck.
"
"The sight is dismal;
[p]And our affairs from England come too late. 
[p]The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
[p]To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
[p]That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
[p]Where should we have our thanks?
"
"Not from his mouth,
[p]Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
[p]He never gave commandment for their death.
[p]But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
[p]You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
[p]Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
[p]High on a stage be placed to the view;
[p]And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
[p]How these things came about. So shall you hear
[p]Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
[p]Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
[p]Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
[p]And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
[p]Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
[p]Truly deliver.
"
"Let us haste to hear it, 
[p]And call the noblest to the audience.
[p]For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
[p]I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
[p]Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
"
"Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
[p]And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
[p]But let this same be presently perform'd,
[p]Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
[p]On plots and errors happen.
"
"Let four captains
[p]Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
[p]For he was likely, had he been put on,
[p]To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
[p]The soldiers' music and the rites of war
[p]Speak loudly for him.
[p]Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
[p]Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
[p]Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
"
"Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
[p]Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
[p]Being mechanical, you ought not walk
[p]Upon a labouring day without the sign
[p]Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
"
"Why, sir, a carpenter.
"
"Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
[p]What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
[p]You, sir, what trade are you?
"
"Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
[p]as you would say, a cobbler.
"
"But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
"
"A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
[p]conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
"
"What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?
"
"Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
[p]if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
"
"What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!
"
"Why, sir, cobble you.
"
"Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
"
"Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
[p]meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
[p]matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
[p]to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
[p]recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
[p]neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
"
"But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
[p]Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
"
"Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
[p]into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
[p]to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
"
"Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
[p]What tributaries follow him to Rome,
[p]To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
[p]You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
[p]O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
[p]Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
[p]Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
[p]To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
[p]Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
[p]The livelong day, with patient expectation,
[p]To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
[p]And when you saw his chariot but appear,
[p]Have you not made an universal shout,
[p]That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
[p]To hear the replication of your sounds
[p]Made in her concave shores?
[p]And do you now put on your best attire?
[p]And do you now cull out a holiday?
[p]And do you now strew flowers in his way
[p]That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
[p]Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
[p]Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
[p]That needs must light on this ingratitude.
"
"Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
[p]Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
[p]Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
[p]Into the channel, till the lowest stream
[p]Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
[p][Exeunt all the Commoners]
[p]See whether their basest metal be not moved;
[p]They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
[p]Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
[p]This way will I disrobe the images,
[p]If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
"
"May we do so?
[p]You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
"
"It is no matter; let no images
[p]Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
[p]And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
[p]So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
[p]These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
[p]Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
[p]Who else would soar above the view of men
[p]And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
"
"Calpurnia!
"
"Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
"
"Calpurnia!
"
"Here, my lord.
"
"Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
[p]When he doth run his course. Antonius!
"
"Caesar, my lord?
"
"Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
[p]To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
[p]The barren, touched in this holy chase,
[p]Shake off their sterile curse.
"
"I shall remember:
[p]When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.
"
"Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
"
"Caesar!
"
"Ha! who calls?
"
"Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
"
"Who is it in the press that calls on me?
[p]I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
[p]Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.
"
"Beware the ides of March.
"
"What man is that?
"
"A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
"
"Set him before me; let me see his face.
"
"Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
"
"What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
"
"Beware the ides of March.
"
"He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
"
"Will you go see the order of the course?
"
"Not I.
"
"I pray you, do.
"
"I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
[p]Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
[p]Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
[p]I'll leave you.
"
"Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
[p]I have not from your eyes that gentleness
[p]And show of love as I was wont to have:
[p]You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
[p]Over your friend that loves you.
"
"Cassius,
[p]Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
[p]I turn the trouble of my countenance
[p]Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
[p]Of late with passions of some difference,
[p]Conceptions only proper to myself,
[p]Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
[p]But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
[p]Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
[p]Nor construe any further my neglect,
[p]Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
[p]Forgets the shows of love to other men.
"
"Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
[p]By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
[p]Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
[p]Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
"
"No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
[p]But by reflection, by some other things.
"
"'Tis just:
[p]And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
[p]That you have no such mirrors as will turn
[p]Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
[p]That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
[p]Where many of the best respect in Rome,
[p]Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
[p]And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
[p]Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
"
"Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
[p]That you would have me seek into myself
[p]For that which is not in me?
"
"Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
[p]And since you know you cannot see yourself
[p]So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
[p]Will modestly discover to yourself
[p]That of yourself which you yet know not of.
[p]And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
[p]Were I a common laugher, or did use
[p]To stale with ordinary oaths my love
[p]To every new protester; if you know
[p]That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
[p]And after scandal them, or if you know
[p]That I profess myself in banqueting
[p]To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
"
"What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
[p]Choose Caesar for their king.
"
"Ay, do you fear it?
[p]Then must I think you would not have it so.
"
"I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
[p]But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
[p]What is it that you would impart to me?
[p]If it be aught toward the general good,
[p]Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
[p]And I will look on both indifferently,
[p]For let the gods so speed me as I love
[p]The name of honour more than I fear death.
"
"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
[p]As well as I do know your outward favour.
[p]Well, honour is the subject of my story.
[p]I cannot tell what you and other men
[p]Think of this life; but, for my single self,
[p]I had as lief not be as live to be
[p]In awe of such a thing as I myself.
[p]I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
[p]We both have fed as well, and we can both
[p]Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
[p]For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
[p]The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
[p]Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
[p]Leap in with me into this angry flood,
[p]And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
[p]Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
[p]And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
[p]The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
[p]With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
[p]And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
[p]But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
[p]Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
[p]I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
[p]Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
[p]The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
[p]Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
[p]Is now become a god, and Cassius is
[p]A wretched creature and must bend his body,
[p]If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
[p]He had a fever when he was in Spain,
[p]And when the fit was on him, I did mark
[p]How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
[p]His coward lips did from their colour fly,
[p]And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
[p]Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
[p]Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
[p]Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
[p]Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Tintinius,'
[p]As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
[p]A man of such a feeble temper should
[p]So get the start of the majestic world
[p]And bear the palm alone.
"
"Another general shout!
[p]I do believe that these applauses are
[p]For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
"
"Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
[p]Like a Colossus, and we petty men
[p]Walk under his huge legs and peep about
[p]To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
[p]Men at some time are masters of their fates:
[p]The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
[p]But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
[p]Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
[p]Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
[p]Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
[p]Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
[p]Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
[p]Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
[p]Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
[p]Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
[p]That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
[p]Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
[p]When went there by an age, since the great flood,
[p]But it was famed with more than with one man?
[p]When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
[p]That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
[p]Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
[p]When there is in it but one only man.
[p]O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
[p]There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
[p]The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
[p]As easily as a king.
"
"That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
[p]What you would work me to, I have some aim:
[p]How I have thought of this and of these times,
[p]I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
[p]I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
[p]Be any further moved. What you have said
[p]I will consider; what you have to say
[p]I will with patience hear, and find a time
[p]Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
[p]Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
[p]Brutus had rather be a villager
[p]Than to repute himself a son of Rome
[p]Under these hard conditions as this time
[p]Is like to lay upon us.
"
"I am glad that my weak words
[p]Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
"
"The games are done and Caesar is returning.
"
"As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
[p]And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
[p]What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
"
"I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
[p]The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
[p]And all the rest look like a chidden train:
[p]Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
[p]Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
[p]As we have seen him in the Capitol,
[p]Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
"
"Casca will tell us what the matter is.
"
"Antonius!
"
"Caesar?
"
"Let me have men about me that are fat;
[p]Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
[p]Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
[p]He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
"
"Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
[p]He is a noble Roman and well given.
"
"Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
[p]Yet if my name were liable to fear,
[p]I do not know the man I should avoid
[p]So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
[p]He is a great observer and he looks
[p]Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
[p]As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
[p]Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
[p]As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
[p]That could be moved to smile at any thing.
[p]Such men as he be never at heart's ease
[p]Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
[p]And therefore are they very dangerous.
[p]I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
[p]Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
[p]Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
[p]And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
"
"You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
"
"Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
[p]That Caesar looks so sad.
"
"Why, you were with him, were you not?
"
"I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
"
"Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
[p]offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
[p]thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
"
"What was the second noise for?
"
"Why, for that too.
"
"They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
"
"Why, for that too.
"
"Was the crown offered him thrice?
"
"Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
[p]time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
[p]mine honest neighbours shouted.
"
"Who offered him the crown?
"
"Why, Antony.
"
"Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
"
"I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
[p]it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
[p]Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
[p]neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
[p]you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
[p]thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
[p]offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
[p]but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
[p]fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
[p]time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
[p]refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
[p]chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
[p]and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
[p]Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
[p]Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
[p]for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
[p]opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
"
"But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
"
"He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
[p]mouth, and was speechless.
"
"'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
"
"No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
[p]And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
"
"I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
[p]Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
[p]clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
[p]displeased them, as they use to do the players in
[p]the theatre, I am no true man.
"
"What said he when he came unto himself?
"
"Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
[p]common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
[p]plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
[p]throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
[p]occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
[p]I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
[p]he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
[p]If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
[p]their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
[p]or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
[p]soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
[p]there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
[p]stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
"
"And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
"
"Ay.
"
"Did Cicero say any thing?
"
"Ay, he spoke Greek.
"
"To what effect?
"
"Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
[p]face again: but those that understood him smiled at
[p]one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
[p]part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
[p]news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
[p]off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
[p]well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
[p]remember it.
"
"Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
"
"No, I am promised forth.
"
"Will you dine with me to-morrow?
"
"Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
[p]worth the eating.
"
"Good: I will expect you.
"
"Do so. Farewell, both.
"
"What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
[p]He was quick mettle when he went to school.
"
"So is he now in execution
[p]Of any bold or noble enterprise,
[p]However he puts on this tardy form.
[p]This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
[p]Which gives men stomach to digest his words
[p]With better appetite.
"
"And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
[p]To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
[p]I will come home to you; or, if you will,
[p]Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
"
"I will do so: till then, think of the world.
[p][Exit BRUTUS]
[p]Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
[p]Thy honourable metal may be wrought
[p]From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
[p]That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
[p]For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
[p]Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
[p]If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
[p]He should not humour me. I will this night,
[p]In several hands, in at his windows throw,
[p]As if they came from several citizens,
[p]Writings all tending to the great opinion
[p]That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
[p]Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
[p]And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
[p]For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
"
"Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
[p]Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
"
"Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
[p]Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
[p]I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
[p]Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
[p]The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
[p]To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
[p]But never till to-night, never till now,
[p]Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
[p]Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
[p]Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
[p]Incenses them to send destruction.
"
"Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?
"
"A common slave--you know him well by sight--
[p]Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
[p]Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
[p]Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
[p]Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
[p]Against the Capitol I met a lion,
[p]Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
[p]Without annoying me: and there were drawn
[p]Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
[p]Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
[p]Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
[p]And yesterday the bird of night did sit
[p]Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
[p]Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
[p]Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
[p]'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
[p]For, I believe, they are portentous things
[p]Unto the climate that they point upon.
"
"Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
[p]But men may construe things after their fashion,
[p]Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
[p]Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
"
"He doth; for he did bid Antonius
[p]Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
"
"Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
[p]Is not to walk in.
"
"Farewell, Cicero.
"
"Who's there?
"
"A Roman.
"
"Casca, by your voice.
"
"Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
"
"A very pleasing night to honest men.
"
"Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
"
"Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
[p]For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
[p]Submitting me unto the perilous night,
[p]And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
[p]Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
[p]And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
[p]The breast of heaven, I did present myself
[p]Even in the aim and very flash of it.
"
"But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
[p]It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
[p]When the most mighty gods by tokens send
[p]Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
"
"You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
[p]That should be in a Roman you do want,
[p]Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
[p]And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
[p]To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
[p]But if you would consider the true cause
[p]Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
[p]Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
[p]Why old men fool and children calculate,
[p]Why all these things change from their ordinance
[p]Their natures and preformed faculties
[p]To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
[p]That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
[p]To make them instruments of fear and warning
[p]Unto some monstrous state.
[p]Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
[p]Most like this dreadful night,
[p]That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
[p]As doth the lion in the Capitol,
[p]A man no mightier than thyself or me
[p]In personal action, yet prodigious grown
[p]And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
"
"'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
"
"Let it be who it is: for Romans now
[p]Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
[p]But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
[p]And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
[p]Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
"
"Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
[p]Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
[p]And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
[p]In every place, save here in Italy.
"
"I know where I will wear this dagger then;
[p]Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
[p]Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
[p]Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
[p]Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
[p]Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
[p]Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
[p]But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
[p]Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
[p]If I know this, know all the world besides,
[p]That part of tyranny that I do bear
[p]I can shake off at pleasure.
"
"So can I:
[p]So every bondman in his own hand bears
[p]The power to cancel his captivity.
"
"And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
[p]Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
[p]But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
[p]He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
[p]Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
[p]Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
[p]What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
[p]For the base matter to illuminate
[p]So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
[p]Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
[p]Before a willing bondman; then I know
[p]My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
[p]And dangers are to me indifferent.
"
"You speak to Casca, and to such a man
[p]That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
[p]Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
[p]And I will set this foot of mine as far
[p]As who goes farthest.
"
"There's a bargain made.
[p]Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
[p]Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
[p]To undergo with me an enterprise
[p]Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
[p]And I do know, by this, they stay for me
[p]In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
[p]There is no stir or walking in the streets;
[p]And the complexion of the element
[p]In favour's like the work we have in hand,
[p]Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
"
"Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
"
"'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
[p]He is a friend.
[p][Enter CINNA]
[p]Cinna, where haste you so?
"
"To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
"
"No, it is Casca; one incorporate
[p]To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
"
"I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
[p]There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
"
"Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
"
"Yes, you are.
[p]O Cassius, if you could
[p]But win the noble Brutus to our party--
"
"Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
[p]And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
[p]Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
[p]In at his window; set this up with wax
[p]Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
[p]Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
[p]Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
"
"All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
[p]To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
[p]And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
"
"That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
[p][Exit CINNA]
[p]Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
[p]See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
[p]Is ours already, and the man entire
[p]Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
"
"O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
[p]And that which would appear offence in us,
[p]His countenance, like richest alchemy,
[p]Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
"
"Him and his worth and our great need of him
[p]You have right well conceited. Let us go,
[p]For it is after midnight; and ere day
[p]We will awake him and be sure of him.
"
"What, Lucius, ho!
[p]I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
[p]Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
[p]I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
[p]When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
"
"Call'd you, my lord?
"
"Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
[p]When it is lighted, come and call me here.
"
"I will, my lord.
"
"It must be by his death: and for my part,
[p]I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
[p]But for the general. He would be crown'd:
[p]How that might change his nature, there's the question.
[p]It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
[p]And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
[p]And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
[p]That at his will he may do danger with.
[p]The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
[p]Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
[p]I have not known when his affections sway'd
[p]More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
[p]That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
[p]Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
[p]But when he once attains the upmost round.
[p]He then unto the ladder turns his back,
[p]Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
[p]By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
[p]Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
[p]Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
[p]Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
[p]Would run to these and these extremities:
[p]And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
[p]Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
[p]And kill him in the shell.
"
"The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
[p]Searching the window for a flint, I found
[p]This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
[p]It did not lie there when I went to bed.
"
"Get you to bed again; it is not day.
[p]Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?
"
"I know not, sir.
"
"Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
"
"I will, sir.
"
"The exhalations whizzing in the air
[p]Give so much light that I may read by them.
[p][Opens the letter and reads]
[p]'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
[p]Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!
[p]Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
[p]Such instigations have been often dropp'd
[p]Where I have took them up.
[p]'Shall Rome, &c.' Thus must I piece it out:
[p]Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
[p]My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
[p]The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
[p]'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
[p]To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
[p]If the redress will follow, thou receivest
[p]Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
"
"Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
"
"'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
[p][Exit LUCIUS]
[p]Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
[p]I have not slept.
[p]Between the acting of a dreadful thing
[p]And the first motion, all the interim is
[p]Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
[p]The Genius and the mortal instruments
[p]Are then in council; and the state of man,
[p]Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
[p]The nature of an insurrection.
"
"Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
[p]Who doth desire to see you.
"
"Is he alone?
"
"No, sir, there are moe with him.
"
"Do you know them?
"
"No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
[p]And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
[p]That by no means I may discover them
[p]By any mark of favour.
"
"Let 'em enter.

[p][Exit LUCIUS]

[p]They are the faction. O conspiracy,

[p]Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,

[p]When evils are most free? O, then by day

[p]Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough

[p]To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;

[p]Hide it in smiles and affability:

[p]For if thou path, thy native semblance on,

[p]Not Erebus itself were dim enough

[p]To hide thee from prevention.

[p][Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS 

[p]BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS]

"
"I think we are too bold upon your rest:
[p]Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
"
"I have been up this hour, awake all night.
[p]Know I these men that come along with you?
"
"Yes, every man of them, and no man here
[p]But honours you; and every one doth wish
[p]You had but that opinion of yourself
[p]Which every noble Roman bears of you.
[p]This is Trebonius.
"
"He is welcome hither.
"
"This, Decius Brutus.
"
"He is welcome too.
"
"This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
"
"They are all welcome.
[p]What watchful cares do interpose themselves
[p]Betwixt your eyes and night?
"
"Shall I entreat a word?
"
"Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
"
"No.
"
"O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
[p]That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
"
"You shall confess that you are both deceived.
[p]Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
[p]Which is a great way growing on the south,
[p]Weighing the youthful season of the year.
[p]Some two months hence up higher toward the north
[p]He first presents his fire; and the high east
[p]Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
"
"Give me your hands all over, one by one.
"
"And let us swear our resolution.
"
"No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
[p]The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
[p]If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
[p]And every man hence to his idle bed;
[p]So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
[p]Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
[p]As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
[p]To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
[p]The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
[p]What need we any spur but our own cause,
[p]To prick us to redress? what other bond
[p]Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
[p]And will not palter? and what other oath
[p]Than honesty to honesty engaged,
[p]That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
[p]Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
[p]Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
[p]That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
[p]Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
[p]The even virtue of our enterprise,
[p]Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
[p]To think that or our cause or our performance
[p]Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
[p]That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
[p]Is guilty of a several bastardy,
[p]If he do break the smallest particle
[p]Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
"
"But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
[p]I think he will stand very strong with us.
"
"Let us not leave him out.
"
"No, by no means.
"
"O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
[p]Will purchase us a good opinion
[p]And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
[p]It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
[p]Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
[p]But all be buried in his gravity.
"
"O, name him not: let us not break with him;
[p]For he will never follow any thing
[p]That other men begin.
"
"Then leave him out.
"
"Indeed he is not fit.
"
"Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
"
"Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
[p]Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
[p]Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
[p]A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
[p]If he improve them, may well stretch so far
[p]As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
[p]Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
"
"Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
[p]To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
[p]Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
[p]For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
[p]Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
[p]We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
[p]And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
[p]O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
[p]And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
[p]Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
[p]Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
[p]Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
[p]Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
[p]And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
[p]Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
[p]And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
[p]Our purpose necessary and not envious:
[p]Which so appearing to the common eyes,
[p]We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
[p]And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
[p]For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
[p]When Caesar's head is off.
"
"Yet I fear him;
[p]For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
"
"Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
[p]If he love Caesar, all that he can do
[p]Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
[p]And that were much he should; for he is given
[p]To sports, to wildness and much company.
"
"There is no fear in him; let him not die;
[p]For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
"
"Peace! count the clock.
"
"The clock hath stricken three.
"
"'Tis time to part.
"
"But it is doubtful yet,
[p]Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
[p]For he is superstitious grown of late,
[p]Quite from the main opinion he held once
[p]Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
[p]It may be, these apparent prodigies,
[p]The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
[p]And the persuasion of his augurers,
[p]May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
"
"Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
[p]I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
[p]That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
[p]And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
[p]Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
[p]But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
[p]He says he does, being then most flattered.
[p]Let me work;
[p]For I can give his humour the true bent,
[p]And I will bring him to the Capitol.
"
"Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
"
"By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
"
"Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
"
"Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
[p]Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
[p]I wonder none of you have thought of him.
"
"Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
[p]He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
[p]Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
"
"The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
[p]And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
[p]What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
"
"Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
[p]Let not our looks put on our purposes,
[p]But bear it as our Roman actors do,
[p]With untired spirits and formal constancy:
[p]And so good morrow to you every one.
[p][Exeunt all but BRUTUS]
[p]Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
[p]Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
[p]Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
[p]Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
[p]Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
"
"Brutus, my lord!
"
"Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
[p]It is not for your health thus to commit
[p]Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
"
"Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
[p]Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
[p]You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
[p]Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
[p]And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
[p]You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
[p]I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
[p]And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
[p]Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
[p]But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
[p]Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
[p]Fearing to strengthen that impatience
[p]Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
[p]Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
[p]Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
[p]It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
[p]And could it work so much upon your shape
[p]As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
[p]I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
[p]Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
"
"I am not well in health, and that is all.
"
"Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
[p]He would embrace the means to come by it.
"
"Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
"
"Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
[p]To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
[p]Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
[p]And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
[p]To dare the vile contagion of the night
[p]And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
[p]To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
[p]You have some sick offence within your mind,
[p]Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
[p]I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
[p]I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
[p]By all your vows of love and that great vow
[p]Which did incorporate and make us one,
[p]That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
[p]Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
[p]Have had to resort to you: for here have been
[p]Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
[p]Even from darkness.
"
"Kneel not, gentle Portia.
"
"I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
[p]Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
[p]Is it excepted I should know no secrets
[p]That appertain to you? Am I yourself
[p]But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
[p]To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
[p]And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
[p]Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
[p]Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
"
"You are my true and honourable wife,
[p]As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
[p]That visit my sad heart
"
"If this were true, then should I know this secret.
[p]I grant I am a woman; but withal
[p]A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
[p]I grant I am a woman; but withal
[p]A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
[p]Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
[p]Being so father'd and so husbanded?
[p]Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
[p]I have made strong proof of my constancy,
[p]Giving myself a voluntary wound
[p]Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
[p]And not my husband's secrets?
"
"O ye gods,
[p]Render me worthy of this noble wife!
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
[p]And by and by thy bosom shall partake
[p]The secrets of my heart.
[p]All my engagements I will construe to thee,
[p]All the charactery of my sad brows:
[p]Leave me with haste.
[p][Exit PORTIA]
[p]Lucius, who's that knocks?
"
"He is a sick man that would speak with you.
"
"Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
[p]Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?
"
"Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
"
"O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
[p]To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
"
"I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
[p]Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
"
"Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
[p]Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
"
"By all the gods that Romans bow before,
[p]I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
[p]Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
[p]Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
[p]My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
[p]And I will strive with things impossible;
[p]Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
"
"A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
"
"But are not some whole that we must make sick?
"
"That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
[p]I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
[p]To whom it must be done.
"
"Set on your foot,
[p]And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
[p]To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
[p]That Brutus leads me on.
"
"Follow me, then.
"
"Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
[p]Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
[p]'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?
"
"My lord?
"
"Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
[p]And bring me their opinions of success.
"
"I will, my lord.
"
"What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
[p]You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
"
"Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
[p]Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
[p]The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
"
"Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
[p]Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
[p]Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
[p]Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
[p]A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
[p]And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
[p]Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
[p]In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
[p]Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
[p]The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
[p]Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
[p]And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
[p]O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
[p]And I do fear them.
"
"What can be avoided
[p]Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
[p]Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
[p]Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
"
"When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
[p]The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
"
"Cowards die many times before their deaths;
[p]The valiant never taste of death but once.
[p]Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
[p]It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
[p]Seeing that death, a necessary end,
[p]Will come when it will come.
[p][Re-enter Servant]
[p]What say the augurers?
"
"They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
[p]Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
[p]They could not find a heart within the beast.
"
"The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
[p]Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
[p]If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
[p]No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
[p]That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
[p]We are two lions litter'd in one day,
[p]And I the elder and more terrible:
[p]And Caesar shall go forth.
"
"Alas, my lord,
[p]Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
[p]Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
[p]That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
[p]We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
[p]And he shall say you are not well to-day:
[p]Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
"
"Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
[p]And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
[p][Enter DECIUS BRUTUS]
[p]Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
"
"Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
[p]I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
"
"And you are come in very happy time,
[p]To bear my greeting to the senators
[p]And tell them that I will not come to-day:
[p]Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
[p]I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
"
"Say he is sick.
"
"Shall Caesar send a lie?
[p]Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
[p]To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
[p]Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
"
"Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
[p]Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
"
"The cause is in my will: I will not come;
[p]That is enough to satisfy the senate.
[p]But for your private satisfaction,
[p]Because I love you, I will let you know:
[p]Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
[p]She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
[p]Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
[p]Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
[p]Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
[p]And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
[p]And evils imminent; and on her knee
[p]Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
"
"This dream is all amiss interpreted;
[p]It was a vision fair and fortunate:
[p]Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
[p]In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
[p]Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
[p]Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
[p]For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
[p]This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
"
"And this way have you well expounded it.
"
"I have, when you have heard what I can say:
[p]And know it now: the senate have concluded
[p]To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
[p]If you shall send them word you will not come,
[p]Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
[p]Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
[p]'Break up the senate till another time,
[p]When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
[p]If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
[p]'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
[p]Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
[p]To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
[p]And reason to my love is liable.
"
"How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!

[p]I am ashamed I did yield to them.

[p]Give me my robe, for I will go.

[p][Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA,

[p]TREBONIUS, and CINNA]

[p]And look where Publius is come to fetch me.

"
"Good morrow, Caesar.
"
"Welcome, Publius.
[p]What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
[p]Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
[p]Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
[p]As that same ague which hath made you lean.
[p]What is 't o'clock?
"
"Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
"
"I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
[p][Enter ANTONY]
[p]See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
[p]Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.
"
"So to most noble Caesar.
"
"Bid them prepare within:
[p]I am to blame to be thus waited for.
[p]Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
[p]I have an hour's talk in store for you;
[p]Remember that you call on me to-day:
[p]Be near me, that I may remember you.
"
"Caesar, I will:
[p][Aside]
[p]and so near will I be,
[p]That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
"
"Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
[p]And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
"
"[Aside] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,

[p]The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!

"
"'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;
[p]come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not
[p]Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
[p]loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
[p]There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
[p]bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
[p]look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
[p]The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
[p]'ARTEMIDORUS.'
[p]Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
[p]And as a suitor will I give him this.
[p]My heart laments that virtue cannot live
[p]Out of the teeth of emulation.
[p]If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
[p]If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
"
"I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
[p]Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
[p]Why dost thou stay?
"
"To know my errand, madam.
"
"I would have had thee there, and here again,
[p]Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
[p]O constancy, be strong upon my side,
[p]Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
[p]I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
[p]How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
[p]Art thou here yet?
"
"Madam, what should I do?
[p]Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
[p]And so return to you, and nothing else?
"
"Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
[p]For he went sickly forth: and take good note
[p]What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
[p]Hark, boy! what noise is that?
"
"I hear none, madam.
"
"Prithee, listen well;
[p]I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
[p]And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
"
"Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
"
"Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
"
"At mine own house, good lady.
"
"What is't o'clock?
"
"About the ninth hour, lady.
"
"Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
"
"Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
[p]To see him pass on to the Capitol.
"
"Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
"
"That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
[p]To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
[p]I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
"
"Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
"
"None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
[p]Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
[p]The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
[p]Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
[p]Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
[p]I'll get me to a place more void, and there
[p]Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
"
"I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
[p]The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
[p]The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
[p]Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
[p]That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
[p]Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
[p]Say I am merry: come to me again,
[p]And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
"
"[To the Soothsayer] The ides of March are come.

"
"Ay, Caesar; but not gone.
"
"Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.
"
"Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
[p]At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
"
"O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
[p]That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.
"
"What touches us ourself shall be last served.
"
"Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
"
"What, is the fellow mad?
"
"Sirrah, give place.
"
"What, urge you your petitions in the street?

[p]Come to the Capitol.

[p][CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest

[p]following]

"
"I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
"
"What enterprise, Popilius?
"
"Fare you well.
"
"What said Popilius Lena?
"
"He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
[p]I fear our purpose is discovered.
"
"Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.
"
"Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
[p]Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
[p]Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
[p]For I will slay myself.
"
"Cassius, be constant:
[p]Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
[p]For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
"
"Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
[p]He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
"
"Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
[p]And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
"
"He is address'd: press near and second him.
"
"Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
"
"Are we all ready? What is now amiss
[p]That Caesar and his senate must redress?
"
"Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
[p]Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
[p]An humble heart,--
"
"I must prevent thee, Cimber.
[p]These couchings and these lowly courtesies
[p]Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
[p]And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
[p]Into the law of children. Be not fond,
[p]To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
[p]That will be thaw'd from the true quality
[p]With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
[p]Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
[p]Thy brother by decree is banished:
[p]If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
[p]I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
[p]Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
[p]Will he be satisfied.
"
"Is there no voice more worthy than my own
[p]To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
[p]For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
"
"I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
[p]Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
[p]Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
"
"What, Brutus!
"
"Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
[p]As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
[p]To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
"
"I could be well moved, if I were as you:
[p]If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
[p]But I am constant as the northern star,
[p]Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
[p]There is no fellow in the firmament.
[p]The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
[p]They are all fire and every one doth shine,
[p]But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
[p]So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
[p]And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
[p]Yet in the number I do know but one
[p]That unassailable holds on his rank,
[p]Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
[p]Let me a little show it, even in this;
[p]That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
[p]And constant do remain to keep him so.
"
"O Caesar,--
"
"Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
"
"Great Caesar,--
"
"Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
"
"Speak, hands for me!

[p][CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and

[p]BRUTUS stab CAESAR]

"
"Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
"
"Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
[p]Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
"
"Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
[p]'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'
"
"People and senators, be not affrighted;
[p]Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
"
"Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
"
"And Cassius too.
"
"Where's Publius?
"
"Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
"
"Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
[p]Should chance--
"
"Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
[p]There is no harm intended to your person,
[p]Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.
"
"And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
[p]Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
"
"Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
[p]But we the doers.
"
"Where is Antony?
"
"Fled to his house amazed:
[p]Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
[p]As it were doomsday.
"
"Fates, we will know your pleasures:
[p]That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
[p]And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
"
"Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
[p]Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
"
"Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
[p]So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
[p]His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
[p]And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
[p]Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
[p]Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
[p]And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
[p]Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'
"
"Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
[p]Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
[p]In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
"
"How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
[p]That now on Pompey's basis lies along
[p]No worthier than the dust!
"
"So oft as that shall be,
[p]So often shall the knot of us be call'd
[p]The men that gave their country liberty.
"
"What, shall we forth?
"
"Ay, every man away:
[p]Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
[p]With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
"
"Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
"
"Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
[p]Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
[p]And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
[p]Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
[p]Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
[p]Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
[p]Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.
[p]If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
[p]May safely come to him, and be resolved
[p]How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
[p]Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
[p]So well as Brutus living; but will follow
[p]The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
[p]Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
[p]With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
"
"Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
[p]I never thought him worse.
[p]Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
[p]He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
[p]Depart untouch'd.
"
"I'll fetch him presently.
"
"I know that we shall have him well to friend.
"
"I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
[p]That fears him much; and my misgiving still
[p]Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
"
"But here comes Antony.
[p][Re-enter ANTONY]
[p]Welcome, Mark Antony.
"
"O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
[p]Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
[p]Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
[p]I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
[p]Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
[p]If I myself, there is no hour so fit
[p]As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
[p]Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
[p]With the most noble blood of all this world.
[p]I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
[p]Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
[p]Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
[p]I shall not find myself so apt to die:
[p]No place will please me so, no mean of death,
[p]As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
[p]The choice and master spirits of this age.
"
"O Antony, beg not your death of us.
[p]Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
[p]As, by our hands and this our present act,
[p]You see we do, yet see you but our hands
[p]And this the bleeding business they have done:
[p]Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
[p]And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
[p]As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
[p]Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
[p]To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
[p]Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
[p]Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
[p]With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
"
"Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
[p]In the disposing of new dignities.
"
"Only be patient till we have appeased
[p]The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
[p]And then we will deliver you the cause,
[p]Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
[p]Have thus proceeded.
"
"I doubt not of your wisdom.
[p]Let each man render me his bloody hand:
[p]First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
[p]Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
[p]Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
[p]Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
[p]Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
[p]Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
[p]My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
[p]That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
[p]Either a coward or a flatterer.
[p]That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
[p]If then thy spirit look upon us now,
[p]Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
[p]To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
[p]Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
[p]Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
[p]Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
[p]Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
[p]It would become me better than to close
[p]In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
[p]Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
[p]Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
[p]Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
[p]O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
[p]And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
[p]How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
[p]Dost thou here lie!
"
"Mark Antony,--
"
"Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
[p]The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
[p]Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
"
"I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
[p]But what compact mean you to have with us?
[p]Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
[p]Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
"
"Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
[p]Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
[p]Friends am I with you all and love you all,
[p]Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
[p]Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
"
"Or else were this a savage spectacle:
[p]Our reasons are so full of good regard
[p]That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
[p]You should be satisfied.
"
"That's all I seek:
[p]And am moreover suitor that I may
[p]Produce his body to the market-place;
[p]And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
[p]Speak in the order of his funeral.
"
"You shall, Mark Antony.
"
"Brutus, a word with you.
[p][Aside to BRUTUS]
[p]You know not what you do: do not consent
[p]That Antony speak in his funeral:
[p]Know you how much the people may be moved
[p]By that which he will utter?
"
"By your pardon;
[p]I will myself into the pulpit first,
[p]And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
[p]What Antony shall speak, I will protest
[p]He speaks by leave and by permission,
[p]And that we are contented Caesar shall
[p]Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
[p]It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
"
"I know not what may fall; I like it not.
"
"Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
[p]You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
[p]But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
[p]And say you do't by our permission;
[p]Else shall you not have any hand at all
[p]About his funeral: and you shall speak
[p]In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
[p]After my speech is ended.
"
"Be it so.
[p]I do desire no more.
"
"Prepare the body then, and follow us.
"
"O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
[p]That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
[p]Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
[p]That ever lived in the tide of times.
[p]Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
[p]Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
[p]Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
[p]To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
[p]A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
[p]Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
[p]Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
[p]Blood and destruction shall be so in use
[p]And dreadful objects so familiar
[p]That mothers shall but smile when they behold
[p]Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
[p]All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
[p]And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
[p]With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
[p]Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
[p]Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
[p]That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
[p]With carrion men, groaning for burial.
[p][Enter a Servant]
[p]You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
"
"I do, Mark Antony.
"
"Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
"
"He did receive his letters, and is coming;
[p]And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
[p]O Caesar!--
"
"Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
[p]Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
[p]Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
[p]Began to water. Is thy master coming?
"
"He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
"
"Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
[p]Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
[p]No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
[p]Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
[p]Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
[p]Into the market-place: there shall I try
[p]In my oration, how the people take
[p]The cruel issue of these bloody men;
[p]According to the which, thou shalt discourse
[p]To young Octavius of the state of things.
[p]Lend me your hand.
"
"We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
"
"Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
[p]Cassius, go you into the other street,
[p]And part the numbers.
[p]Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
[p]Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
[p]And public reasons shall be rendered
[p]Of Caesar's death.
"
"I will hear Brutus speak.
"
"I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,

[p]When severally we hear them rendered.

[p][Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS

[p]goes into the pulpit]

"
"The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
"
"Be patient till the last.
[p]Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
[p]cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
[p]for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
[p]you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
[p]awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
[p]If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
[p]Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
[p]was no less than his. If then that friend demand
[p]why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
[p]--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
[p]Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
[p]die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
[p]all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
[p]as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
[p]valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
[p]slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
[p]fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
[p]ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
[p]bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
[p]Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
[p]any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
[p]vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
[p]for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
"
"None, Brutus, none.
"
"Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
[p]Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
[p]his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
[p]extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
[p]enforced, for which he suffered death.
[p][Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body]
[p]Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
[p]though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
[p]the benefit of his dying, a place in the
[p]commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
[p]I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
[p]good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
[p]when it shall please my country to need my death.
"
"Live, Brutus! live, live!
"
"Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
"
"Give him a statue with his ancestors.
"
"Let him be Caesar.
"
"Caesar's better parts
[p]Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
"
"We'll bring him to his house
[p]With shouts and clamours.
"
"My countrymen,--
"
"Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
"
"Peace, ho!
"
"Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
[p]And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
[p]Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
[p]Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
[p]By our permission, is allow'd to make.
[p]I do entreat you, not a man depart,
[p]Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
"
"Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.
"
"Let him go up into the public chair;
[p]We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
"
"For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
"
"What does he say of Brutus?
"
"He says, for Brutus' sake,
[p]He finds himself beholding to us all.
"
"'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
"
"This Caesar was a tyrant.
"
"Nay, that's certain:
[p]We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
"
"Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
"
"You gentle Romans,--
"
"Peace, ho! let us hear him.
"
"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
[p]I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
[p]The evil that men do lives after them;
[p]The good is oft interred with their bones;
[p]So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
[p]Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
[p]If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
[p]And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
[p]Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
[p]For Brutus is an honourable man;
[p]So are they all, all honourable men--
[p]Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
[p]He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
[p]But Brutus says he was ambitious;
[p]And Brutus is an honourable man.
[p]He hath brought many captives home to Rome
[p]Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
[p]Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
[p]When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
[p]Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
[p]Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
[p]And Brutus is an honourable man.
[p]You all did see that on the Lupercal
[p]I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
[p]Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
[p]Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
[p]And, sure, he is an honourable man.
[p]I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
[p]But here I am to speak what I do know.
[p]You all did love him once, not without cause:
[p]What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
[p]O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
[p]And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
[p]My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
[p]And I must pause till it come back to me.
"
"Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
"
"If thou consider rightly of the matter,
[p]Caesar has had great wrong.
"
"Has he, masters?
[p]I fear there will a worse come in his place.
"
"Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
[p]Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
"
"If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
"
"Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
"
"There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
"
"Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
"
"But yesterday the word of Caesar might
[p]Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
[p]And none so poor to do him reverence.
[p]O masters, if I were disposed to stir
[p]Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
[p]I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
[p]Who, you all know, are honourable men:
[p]I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
[p]To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
[p]Than I will wrong such honourable men.
[p]But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
[p]I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
[p]Let but the commons hear this testament--
[p]Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
[p]And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
[p]And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
[p]Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
[p]And, dying, mention it within their wills,
[p]Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
[p]Unto their issue.
"
"We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
"
"The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
"
"Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
[p]It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
[p]You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
[p]And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
[p]It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
[p]'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
[p]For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
"
"Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
[p]You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
"
"Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
[p]I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
[p]I fear I wrong the honourable men
[p]Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
"
"They were traitors: honourable men!
"
"The will! the testament!
"
"They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
"
"You will compel me, then, to read the will?
[p]Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
[p]And let me show you him that made the will.
[p]Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
"
"Come down.
"
"Descend.
"
"You shall have leave.
"
"A ring; stand round.
"
"Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
"
"Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
"
"Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
"
"Stand back; room; bear back.
"
"If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
[p]You all do know this mantle: I remember
[p]The first time ever Caesar put it on;
[p]'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
[p]That day he overcame the Nervii:
[p]Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
[p]See what a rent the envious Casca made:
[p]Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
[p]And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
[p]Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
[p]As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
[p]If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
[p]For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
[p]Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
[p]This was the most unkindest cut of all;
[p]For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
[p]Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
[p]Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
[p]And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
[p]Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
[p]Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
[p]O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
[p]Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
[p]Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
[p]O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
[p]The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
[p]Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
[p]Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
[p]Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
"
"O piteous spectacle!
"
"O noble Caesar!
"
"O woful day!
"
"O traitors, villains!
"
"O most bloody sight!
"
"We will be revenged.
"
"Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
[p]Let not a traitor live!
"
"Stay, countrymen.
"
"Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
"
"We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
"
"Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
[p]To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
[p]They that have done this deed are honourable:
[p]What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
[p]That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
[p]And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
[p]I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
[p]I am no orator, as Brutus is;
[p]But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
[p]That love my friend; and that they know full well
[p]That gave me public leave to speak of him:
[p]For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
[p]Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
[p]To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
[p]I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
[p]Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
[p]And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
[p]And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
[p]Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
[p]In every wound of Caesar that should move
[p]The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
"
"We'll mutiny.
"
"We'll burn the house of Brutus.
"
"Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
"
"Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
"
"Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
"
"Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
[p]Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
[p]Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
[p]You have forgot the will I told you of.
"
"Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
"
"Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
[p]To every Roman citizen he gives,
[p]To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
"
"Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
"
"O royal Caesar!
"
"Hear me with patience.
"
"Peace, ho!
"
"Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
[p]His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
[p]On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
[p]And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
[p]To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
[p]Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
"
"Never, never. Come, away, away!
[p]We'll burn his body in the holy place,
[p]And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
[p]Take up the body.
"
"Go fetch fire.
"
"Pluck down benches.
"
"Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
"
"Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
[p]Take thou what course thou wilt!
[p][Enter a Servant]
[p]How now, fellow!
"
"Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
"
"Where is he?
"
"He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
"
"And thither will I straight to visit him:
[p]He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
[p]And in this mood will give us any thing.
"
"I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
[p]Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
"
"Belike they had some notice of the people,
[p]How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
"
"I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
[p]And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
[p]I have no will to wander forth of doors,
[p]Yet something leads me forth.
"
"What is your name?
"
"Whither are you going?
"
"Where do you dwell?
"
"Are you a married man or a bachelor?
"
"Answer every man directly.
"
"Ay, and briefly.
"
"Ay, and wisely.
"
"Ay, and truly, you were best.
"
"What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
[p]dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
[p]answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
[p]truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
"
"That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
[p]you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.
"
"Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
"
"As a friend or an enemy?
"
"As a friend.
"
"That matter is answered directly.
"
"For your dwelling,--briefly.
"
"Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
"
"Your name, sir, truly.
"
"Truly, my name is Cinna.
"
"Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.
"
"I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
"
"Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
"
"I am not Cinna the conspirator.
"
"It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
[p]name out of his heart, and turn him going.
"
"Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:
[p]to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'
[p]house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!
"
"These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.
"
"Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
"
"I do consent--
"
"Prick him down, Antony.
"
"Upon condition Publius shall not live,
[p]Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
"
"He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
[p]But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
[p]Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
[p]How to cut off some charge in legacies.
"
"What, shall I find you here?
"
"Or here, or at the Capitol.
"
"This is a slight unmeritable man,
[p]Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
[p]The three-fold world divided, he should stand
[p]One of the three to share it?
"
"So you thought him;
[p]And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
[p]In our black sentence and proscription.
"
"Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
[p]And though we lay these honours on this man,
[p]To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
[p]He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
[p]To groan and sweat under the business,
[p]Either led or driven, as we point the way;
[p]And having brought our treasure where we will,
[p]Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
[p]Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
[p]And graze in commons.
"
"You may do your will;
[p]But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
"
"So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
[p]I do appoint him store of provender:
[p]It is a creature that I teach to fight,
[p]To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
[p]His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
[p]And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
[p]He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
[p]A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
[p]On abjects, orts and imitations,
[p]Which, out of use and staled by other men,
[p]Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
[p]But as a property. And now, Octavius,
[p]Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
[p]Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
[p]Therefore let our alliance be combined,
[p]Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
[p]And let us presently go sit in council,
[p]How covert matters may be best disclosed,
[p]And open perils surest answered.
"
"Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
[p]And bay'd about with many enemies;
[p]And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
[p]Millions of mischiefs.
"
"Stand, ho!
"
"Give the word, ho! and stand.
"
"What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
"
"He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
[p]To do you salutation from his master.
"
"He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
[p]In his own change, or by ill officers,
[p]Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
[p]Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
[p]I shall be satisfied.
"
"I do not doubt
[p]But that my noble master will appear
[p]Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
"
"He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
[p]How he received you, let me be resolved.
"
"With courtesy and with respect enough;
[p]But not with such familiar instances,
[p]Nor with such free and friendly conference,
[p]As he hath used of old.
"
"Thou hast described
[p]A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
[p]When love begins to sicken and decay,
[p]It useth an enforced ceremony.
[p]There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
[p]But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
[p]Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
[p]But when they should endure the bloody spur,
[p]They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
[p]Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
"
"They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
[p]The greater part, the horse in general,
[p]Are come with Cassius.
"
"Hark! he is arrived.
[p][Low march within]
[p]March gently on to meet him.
"
"Stand, ho!
"
"Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
"
"Stand!
"
"Stand!
"
"Stand!
"
"Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
"
"Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
[p]And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
"
"Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
[p]And when you do them--
"
"Cassius, be content.
[p]Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
[p]Before the eyes of both our armies here,
[p]Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
[p]Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
[p]Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
[p]And I will give you audience.
"
"Pindarus,
[p]Bid our commanders lead their charges off
[p]A little from this ground.
"
"Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
[p]Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
[p]Let Lucius and Tintinius guard our door.
"
"That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
[p]You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
[p]For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
[p]Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
[p]Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
"
"You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
"
"In such a time as this it is not meet
[p]That every nice offence should bear his comment.
"
"Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
[p]Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
[p]To sell and mart your offices for gold
[p]To undeservers.
"
"I an itching palm!
[p]You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
[p]Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
"
"The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
[p]And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
"
"Chastisement!
"
"Remember March, the ides of March remember:
[p]Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
[p]What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
[p]And not for justice? What, shall one of us
[p]That struck the foremost man of all this world
[p]But for supporting robbers, shall we now
[p]Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
[p]And sell the mighty space of our large honours
[p]For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
[p]I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
[p]Than such a Roman.
"
"Brutus, bay not me;
[p]I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
[p]To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
[p]Older in practise, abler than yourself
[p]To make conditions.
"
"Go to; you are not, Cassius.
"
"I am.
"
"I say you are not.
"
"Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
[p]Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
"
"Away, slight man!
"
"Is't possible?
"
"Hear me, for I will speak.
[p]Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
[p]Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
"
"O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?
"
"All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
[p]Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
[p]And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
[p]Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
[p]Under your testy humour? By the gods
[p]You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
[p]Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
[p]I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
[p]When you are waspish.
"
"Is it come to this?
"
"You say you are a better soldier:
[p]Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
[p]And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
[p]I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
"
"You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
[p]I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
[p]Did I say 'better'?
"
"If you did, I care not.
"
"When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
"
"Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
"
"I durst not!
"
"No.
"
"What, durst not tempt him!
"
"For your life you durst not!
"
"Do not presume too much upon my love;
[p]I may do that I shall be sorry for.
"
"You have done that you should be sorry for.
[p]There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
[p]For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
[p]That they pass by me as the idle wind,
[p]Which I respect not. I did send to you
[p]For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
[p]For I can raise no money by vile means:
[p]By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
[p]And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
[p]From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
[p]By any indirection: I did send
[p]To you for gold to pay my legions,
[p]Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
[p]Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
[p]When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
[p]To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
[p]Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
[p]Dash him to pieces!
"
"I denied you not.
"
"You did.
"
"I did not: he was but a fool that brought
[p]My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
[p]A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
[p]But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
"
"I do not, till you practise them on me.
"
"You love me not.
"
"I do not like your faults.
"
"A friendly eye could never see such faults.
"
"A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
[p]As huge as high Olympus.
"
"Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
[p]Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
[p]For Cassius is aweary of the world;
[p]Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
[p]Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
[p]Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
[p]To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
[p]My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
[p]And here my naked breast; within, a heart
[p]Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
[p]If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
[p]I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
[p]Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
[p]When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
[p]Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
"
"Sheathe your dagger:
[p]Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
[p]Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
[p]O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
[p]That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
[p]Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
[p]And straight is cold again.
"
"Hath Cassius lived
[p]To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
[p]When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?
"
"When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
"
"Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
"
"And my heart too.
"
"O Brutus!
"
"What's the matter?
"
"Have not you love enough to bear with me,
[p]When that rash humour which my mother gave me
[p]Makes me forgetful?
"
"Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
[p]When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
[p]He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
"
"[Within] Let me go in to see the generals;

[p]There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet

[p]They be alone.

"
"[Within] You shall not come to them.

"
"[Within] Nothing but death shall stay me.

"
"How now! what's the matter?
"
"For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
[p]Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
[p]For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
"
"Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
"
"Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
"
"Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
"
"I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
[p]What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
[p]Companion, hence!
"
"Away, away, be gone.
"
"Lucilius and Tintinius, bid the commanders
[p]Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
"
"And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
[p]Immediately to us.
"
"Lucius, a bowl of wine!
"
"I did not think you could have been so angry.
"
"O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
"
"Of your philosophy you make no use,
[p]If you give place to accidental evils.
"
"No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
"
"Ha! Portia!
"
"She is dead.
"
"How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
[p]O insupportable and touching loss!
[p]Upon what sickness?
"
"Impatient of my absence,
[p]And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
[p]Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
[p]That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
[p]And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
"
"And died so?
"
"Even so.
"
"O ye immortal gods!
"
"Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
[p]In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
"
"My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
[p]Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
[p]I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
"
"Come in, Tintinius!
[p][Exit LUCIUS]
[p][Re-enter Tintinius, with MESSALA]
[p]Welcome, good Messala.
[p]Now sit we close about this taper here,
[p]And call in question our necessities.
"
"Portia, art thou gone?
"
"No more, I pray you.
[p]Messala, I have here received letters,
[p]That young Octavius and Mark Antony
[p]Come down upon us with a mighty power,
[p]Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
"
"Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
"
"With what addition?
"
"That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
[p]Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
[p]Have put to death an hundred senators.
"
"Therein our letters do not well agree;
[p]Mine speak of seventy senators that died
[p]By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
"
"Cicero one!
"
"Cicero is dead,
[p]And by that order of proscription.
[p]Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
"
"No, Messala.
"
"Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
"
"Nothing, Messala.
"
"That, methinks, is strange.
"
"Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
"
"No, my lord.
"
"Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
"
"Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
[p]For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
"
"Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
[p]With meditating that she must die once,
[p]I have the patience to endure it now.
"
"Even so great men great losses should endure.
"
"I have as much of this in art as you,
[p]But yet my nature could not bear it so.
"
"Well, to our work alive. What do you think
[p]Of marching to Philippi presently?
"
"I do not think it good.
"
"Your reason?
"
"This it is:
[p]'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
[p]So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
[p]Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
[p]Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
"
"Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
[p]The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
[p]Do stand but in a forced affection;
[p]For they have grudged us contribution:
[p]The enemy, marching along by them,
[p]By them shall make a fuller number up,
[p]Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
[p]From which advantage shall we cut him off,
[p]If at Philippi we do face him there,
[p]These people at our back.
"
"Hear me, good brother.
"
"Under your pardon. You must note beside,
[p]That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
[p]Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
[p]The enemy increaseth every day;
[p]We, at the height, are ready to decline.
[p]There is a tide in the affairs of men,
[p]Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
[p]Omitted, all the voyage of their life
[p]Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
[p]On such a full sea are we now afloat;
[p]And we must take the current when it serves,
[p]Or lose our ventures.
"
"Then, with your will, go on;
[p]We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
"
"The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
[p]And nature must obey necessity;
[p]Which we will niggard with a little rest.
[p]There is no more to say?
"
"No more. Good night:
[p]Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
"
"Lucius!
[p][Enter LUCIUS]
[p]My gown.
[p][Exit LUCIUS]
[p]Farewell, good Messala:
[p]Good night, Tintinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
[p]Good night, and good repose.
"
"O my dear brother!
[p]This was an ill beginning of the night:
[p]Never come such division 'tween our souls!
[p]Let it not, Brutus.
"
"Every thing is well.
"
"Good night, my lord.
"
"Good night, good brother.
"
"[with MESSALA] Good night, Lord Brutus.
"
"Farewell, every one.
[p][Exeunt all but BRUTUS]
[p][Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown]
[p]Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
"
"Here in the tent.
"
"What, thou speak'st drowsily?
[p]Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.
[p]Call Claudius and some other of my men:
[p]I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
"
"Varro and Claudius!
"
"Calls my lord?
"
"I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
[p]It may be I shall raise you by and by
[p]On business to my brother Cassius.
"
"So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
"
"I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
[p]It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
[p]Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
[p]I put it in the pocket of my gown.
"
"I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
"
"Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
[p]Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
[p]And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
"
"Ay, my lord, an't please you.
"
"It does, my boy:
[p]I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
"
"It is my duty, sir.
"
"I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
[p]I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
"
"I have slept, my lord, already.
"
"It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
[p]I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
[p]I will be good to thee.
[p][Music, and a song]
[p]This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
[p]Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
[p]That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
[p]I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
[p]If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
[p]I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
[p]Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
[p]Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
[p][Enter the Ghost of CAESAR]
[p]How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
[p]I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
[p]That shapes this monstrous apparition.
[p]It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
[p]Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
[p]That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
[p]Speak to me what thou art.
"
"Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
"
"Why comest thou?
"
"To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
"
"Well; then I shall see thee again?
"
"Ay, at Philippi.
"
"Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
[p][Exit Ghost]
[p]Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
[p]Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
[p]Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!
"
"The strings, my lord, are false.
"
"He thinks he still is at his instrument.
[p]Lucius, awake!
"
"My lord?
"
"Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
"
"My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
"
"Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
"
"Nothing, my lord.
"
"Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
[p][To VARRO]
[p]Fellow thou, awake!
"
"My lord?
"
"My lord?
"
"Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
"
"[with Claudius] Did we, my lord?
"
"Ay: saw you any thing?
"
"No, my lord, I saw nothing.
"
"Nor I, my lord.
"
"Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
[p]Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
[p]And we will follow.
"
"[with Claudius] It shall be done, my lord.
"
"Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:
[p]You said the enemy would not come down,
[p]But keep the hills and upper regions;
[p]It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
[p]They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
[p]Answering before we do demand of them.
"
"Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
[p]Wherefore they do it: they could be content
[p]To visit other places; and come down
[p]With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
[p]To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
[p]But 'tis not so.
"
"Prepare you, generals:
[p]The enemy comes on in gallant show;
[p]Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
[p]And something to be done immediately.
"
"Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
[p]Upon the left hand of the even field.
"
"Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
"
"Why do you cross me in this exigent?
"
"I do not cross you; but I will do so.

[p][March]

[p][Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army;

[p]LUCILIUS, Tintinius, MESSALA, and others]

"
"They stand, and would have parley.
"
"Stand fast, Tintinius: we must out and talk.
"
"Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
"
"No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
[p]Make forth; the generals would have some words.
"
"Stir not until the signal.
"
"Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?
"
"Not that we love words better, as you do.
"
"Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
"
"In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
[p]Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
[p]Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'
"
"Antony,
[p]The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
[p]But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
[p]And leave them honeyless.
"
"Not stingless too.
"
"O, yes, and soundless too;
[p]For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
[p]And very wisely threat before you sting.
"
"Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
[p]Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
[p]You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
[p]And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
[p]Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
[p]Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
"
"Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
[p]This tongue had not offended so to-day,
[p]If Cassius might have ruled.
"
"Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
[p]The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;
[p]I draw a sword against conspirators;
[p]When think you that the sword goes up again?
[p]Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
[p]Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
[p]Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
"
"Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
[p]Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
"
"So I hope;
[p]I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
"
"O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
[p]Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.
"
"A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
[p]Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
"
"Old Cassius still!
"
"Come, Antony, away!
[p]Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
[p]If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
[p]If not, when you have stomachs.
"
"Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
[p]The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
"
"Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.
"
"[Standing forth.] My lord?

"
"Messala!
"
"[Standing forth.] What says my general?

"
"Messala,
[p]This is my birth-day; as this very day
[p]Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
[p]Be thou my witness that against my will,
[p]As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
[p]Upon one battle all our liberties.
[p]You know that I held Epicurus strong
[p]And his opinion: now I change my mind,
[p]And partly credit things that do presage.
[p]Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
[p]Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
[p]Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
[p]Who to Philippi here consorted us:
[p]This morning are they fled away and gone;
[p]And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
[p]Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
[p]As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
[p]A canopy most fatal, under which
[p]Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
"
"Believe not so.
"
"I but believe it partly;
[p]For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
[p]To meet all perils very constantly.
"
"Even so, Lucilius.
"
"Now, most noble Brutus,
[p]The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
[p]Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
[p]But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
[p]Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
[p]If we do lose this battle, then is this
[p]The very last time we shall speak together:
[p]What are you then determined to do?
"
"Even by the rule of that philosophy
[p]By which I did blame Cato for the death
[p]Which he did give himself, I know not how,
[p]But I do find it cowardly and vile,
[p]For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
[p]The time of life: arming myself with patience
[p]To stay the providence of some high powers
[p]That govern us below.
"
"Then, if we lose this battle,
[p]You are contented to be led in triumph
[p]Thorough the streets of Rome?
"
"No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
[p]That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
[p]He bears too great a mind. But this same day
[p]Must end that work the ides of March begun;
[p]And whether we shall meet again I know not.
[p]Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
[p]For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
[p]If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
[p]If not, why then, this parting was well made.
"
"For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
[p]If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
[p]If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
"
"Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
[p]The end of this day's business ere it come!
[p]But it sufficeth that the day will end,
[p]And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!
"
"Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
[p]Unto the legions on the other side.
[p][Loud alarum]
[p]Let them set on at once; for I perceive
[p]But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
[p]And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
[p]Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
"
"O, look, Tintinius, look, the villains fly!
[p]Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
[p]This ensign here of mine was turning back;
[p]I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
"
"O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
[p]Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
[p]Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
[p]Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
"
"Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
[p]Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
[p]Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
"
"This hill is far enough. Look, look, Tintinius;
[p]Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
"
"They are, my lord.
"
"Tintinius, if thou lovest me,
[p]Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
[p]Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
[p]And here again; that I may rest assured
[p]Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
"
"I will be here again, even with a thought.
"
"Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
[p]My sight was ever thick; regard Tintinius,
[p]And tell me what thou notest about the field.
[p][PINDARUS ascends the hill]
[p]This day I breathed first: time is come round,
[p]And where I did begin, there shall I end;
[p]My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?
"
"[Above] O my lord!

"
"What news?
"
"[Above] Tintinius is enclosed round about

[p]With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;

[p]Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.

[p]Now, Tintinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.

[p]He's ta'en.

[p][Shout]

[p]And, hark! they shout for joy.

"
"Come down, behold no more.
[p]O, coward that I am, to live so long,
[p]To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
[p][PINDARUS descends]
[p]Come hither, sirrah:
[p]In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
[p]And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
[p]That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
[p]Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
[p]Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
[p]That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
[p]Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
[p]And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
[p]Guide thou the sword.
[p][PINDARUS stabs him]
[p]Caesar, thou art revenged,
[p]Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
"
"So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
[p]Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
[p]Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
[p]Where never Roman shall take note of him.
"
"It is but change, Tintinius; for Octavius
[p]Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
[p]As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
"
"These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
"
"Where did you leave him?
"
"All disconsolate,
[p]With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
"
"Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
"
"He lies not like the living. O my heart!
"
"Is not that he?
"
"No, this was he, Messala,
[p]But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
[p]As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
[p]So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
[p]The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
[p]Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
[p]Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
"
"Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
[p]O hateful error, melancholy's child,
[p]Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
[p]The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
[p]Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
[p]But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
"
"What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?
"
"Seek him, Tintinius, whilst I go to meet
[p]The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
[p]Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
[p]For piercing steel and darts envenomed
[p]Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
[p]As tidings of this sight.
"
"Hie you, Messala,

[p]And I will seek for Pindarus the while.

[p][Exit MESSALA]

[p]Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?

[p]Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they

[p]Put on my brows this wreath of victory,

[p]And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?

[p]Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!

[p]But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;

[p]Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I

[p]Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,

[p]And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.

[p]By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part

[p]Come, Cassius' sword, and find Tintinius' heart.

[p][Kills himself]

[p][Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO,

[p]STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS]

"
"Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
"
"Lo, yonder, and Tintinius mourning it.
"
"Tintinius' face is upward.
"
"He is slain.
"
"O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
[p]Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
[p]In our own proper entrails.
"
"Brave Tintinius!
[p]Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
"
"Are yet two Romans living such as these?
[p]The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
[p]It is impossible that ever Rome
[p]Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
[p]To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
[p]I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
[p]Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
[p]His funerals shall not be in our camp,
[p]Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
[p]And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
[p]Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
[p]'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
[p]We shall try fortune in a second fight.
"
"Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
"
"What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
[p]I will proclaim my name about the field:
[p]I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
[p]A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
[p]I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
"
"And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
[p]Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
"
"O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
[p]Why, now thou diest as bravely as Tintinius;
[p]And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.
"
"Yield, or thou diest.
"
"Only I yield to die:
[p]There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
[p][Offering money]
[p]Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
"
"We must not. A noble prisoner!
"
"Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
"
"I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
[p][Enter ANTONY]
[p]Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
"
"Where is he?
"
"Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
[p]I dare assure thee that no enemy
[p]Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
[p]The gods defend him from so great a shame!
[p]When you do find him, or alive or dead,
[p]He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
"
"This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
[p]A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
[p]Give him all kindness: I had rather have
[p]Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
[p]And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
[p]And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
[p]How every thing is chanced.
"
"Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
"
"Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
[p]He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.
"
"Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
[p]It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
"
"What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
"
"Peace then! no words.
"
"I'll rather kill myself.
"
"Hark thee, Dardanius.
"
"Shall I do such a deed?
"
"O Dardanius!
"
"O Clitus!
"
"What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
"
"To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
"
"Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
[p]That it runs over even at his eyes.
"
"Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.
"
"What says my lord?
"
"Why, this, Volumnius:
[p]The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
[p]Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
[p]And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
[p]I know my hour is come.
"
"Not so, my lord.
"
"Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
[p]Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
[p]Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
[p][Low alarums]
[p]It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
[p]Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
[p]Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
[p]Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
[p]Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
"
"That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
"
"Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.
"
"Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
[p]Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
[p]Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
[p]My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
[p]I found no man but he was true to me.
[p]I shall have glory by this losing day
[p]More than Octavius and Mark Antony
[p]By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
[p]So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
[p]Hath almost ended his life's history:
[p]Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
[p]That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
"
"Fly, my lord, fly.
"
"Hence! I will follow.
[p][Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS]
[p]I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
[p]Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
[p]Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
[p]Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
[p]While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
"
"Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
"
"Farewell, good Strato.

[p][Runs on his sword]

[p]Caesar, now be still:

[p]I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.

[p][Dies]

[p][Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA,

[p]LUCILIUS, and the army]

"
"What man is that?
"
"My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
"
"Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
[p]The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
[p]For Brutus only overcame himself,
[p]And no man else hath honour by his death.
"
"So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
[p]That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
"
"All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
[p]Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
"
"Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
"
"Do so, good Messala.
"
"How died my master, Strato?
"
"I held the sword, and he did run on it.
"
"Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
[p]That did the latest service to my master.
"
"This was the noblest Roman of them all:
[p]All the conspirators save only he
[p]Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
[p]He only, in a general honest thought
[p]And common good to all, made one of them.
[p]His life was gentle, and the elements
[p]So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
[p]And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
"
"According to his virtue let us use him,
[p]With all respect and rites of burial.
[p]Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
[p]Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
[p]So call the field to rest; and let's away,
[p]To part the glories of this happy day.
"
"I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than
[p]Cornwall.
"
"It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the
[p]kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for
[p]equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make
[p]choice of either's moiety.
"
"Is not this your son, my lord?
"
"His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so often
[p]blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.
"
"I cannot conceive you.
"
"Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew
[p]round-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she
[p]had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
"
"I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so
[p]proper.
"
"But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than
[p]this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave came
[p]something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was
[p]his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the
[p]whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble gentleman,
[p]Edmund?
"
"[comes forward] No, my lord.
"
"My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable
[p]friend.
"
"My services to your lordship.
"
"I must love you, and sue to know you better.
"
"Sir, I shall study deserving.
"
"He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.
[p][Sound a sennet.]
[p]The King is coming.
"
"Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
"
"I shall, my liege.
"
"Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
[p]Give me the map there. Know we have divided
[p]In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
[p]To shake all cares and business from our age,
[p]Conferring them on younger strengths while we
[p]Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
[p]And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
[p]We have this hour a constant will to publish
[p]Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
[p]May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
[p]Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
[p]Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
[p]And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters
[p](Since now we will divest us both of rule,
[p]Interest of territory, cares of state),
[p]Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
[p]That we our largest bounty may extend
[p]Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
[p]Our eldest-born, speak first.
"
"Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
[p]Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;
[p]Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
[p]No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
[p]As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;
[p]A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
[p]Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
"
"[aside] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.
"
"Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
[p]With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
[p]With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
[p]We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue
[p]Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,
[p]Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
"
"Sir, I am made
[p]Of the selfsame metal that my sister is,
[p]And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
[p]I find she names my very deed of love;
[p]Only she comes too short, that I profess
[p]Myself an enemy to all other joys
[p]Which the most precious square of sense possesses,
[p]And find I am alone felicitate
[p]In your dear Highness' love.
"
"[aside] Then poor Cordelia!
[p]And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
[p]More richer than my tongue.
"
"To thee and thine hereditary ever
[p]Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
[p]No less in space, validity, and pleasure
[p]Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,
[p]Although the last, not least; to whose young love
[p]The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
[p]Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw
[p]A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
"
"Nothing, my lord.
"
"Nothing?
"
"Nothing.
"
"Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.
"
"Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
[p]My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty
[p]According to my bond; no more nor less.
"
"How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,
[p]Lest it may mar your fortunes.
"
"Good my lord,
[p]You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I
[p]Return those duties back as are right fit,
[p]Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
[p]Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
[p]They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
[p]That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
[p]Half my love with him, half my care and duty.
[p]Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
[p]To love my father all.
"
"But goes thy heart with this?
"
"Ay, good my lord.
"
"So young, and so untender?
"
"So young, my lord, and true.
"
"Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!
[p]For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
[p]The mysteries of Hecate and the night;
[p]By all the operation of the orbs
[p]From whom we do exist and cease to be;
[p]Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
[p]Propinquity and property of blood,
[p]And as a stranger to my heart and me
[p]Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
[p]Or he that makes his generation messes
[p]To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
[p]Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
[p]As thou my sometime daughter.
"
"Good my liege-
"
"Peace, Kent!
[p]Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
[p]I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
[p]On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-
[p]So be my grave my peace as here I give
[p]Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
[p]Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,
[p]With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;
[p]Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
[p]I do invest you jointly in my power,
[p]Preeminence, and all the large effects
[p]That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
[p]With reservation of an hundred knights,
[p]By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
[p]Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
[p]The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,
[p]Revenue, execution of the rest,
[p]Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,
[p]This coronet part betwixt you.
"
"Royal Lear,
[p]Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
[p]Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,
[p]As my great patron thought on in my prayers-
"
"The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
"
"Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
[p]The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly
[p]When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
[p]Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
[p]When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
[p]When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;
[p]And in thy best consideration check
[p]This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,
[p]Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
[p]Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
[p]Reverbs no hollowness.
"
"Kent, on thy life, no more!
"
"My life I never held but as a pawn
[p]To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,
[p]Thy safety being the motive.
"
"Out of my sight!
"
"See better, Lear, and let me still remain
[p]The true blank of thine eye.
"
"Now by Apollo-
"
"Now by Apollo, King,
[p]Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
"
"O vassal! miscreant! [Lays his hand on his sword.]
"
"[with Cornwall] Dear sir, forbear!
"
"Do!
[p]Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
[p]Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
[p]Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
[p]I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
"
"Hear me, recreant!
[p]On thine allegiance, hear me!
[p]Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-
[p]Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride
[p]To come between our sentence and our power,-
[p]Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-
[p]Our potency made good, take thy reward.
[p]Five days we do allot thee for provision
[p]To shield thee from diseases of the world,
[p]And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
[p]Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,
[p]Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
[p]The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
[p]This shall not be revok'd.
"
"Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,
[p]Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
[p][To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
[p]That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!
[p][To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your deeds
[p]   approve,
[p]That good effects may spring from words of love.
[p]Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
[p]He'll shape his old course in a country new. Exit.
"
"Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
"
"My Lord of Burgundy,
[p]We first address toward you, who with this king
[p]Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least
[p]Will you require in present dower with her,
[p]Or cease your quest of love?
"
"Most royal Majesty,
[p]I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,
[p]Nor will you tender less.
"
"Right noble Burgundy,
[p]When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
[p]But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.
[p]If aught within that little seeming substance,
[p]Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,
[p]And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
[p]She's there, and she is yours.
"
"I know no answer.
"
"Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
[p]Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,
[p]Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
[p]Take her, or leave her?
"
"Pardon me, royal sir.
[p]Election makes not up on such conditions.
"
"Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,
[p]I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,
[p]I would not from your love make such a stray
[p]To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
[p]T' avert your liking a more worthier way
[p]Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
[p]Almost t' acknowledge hers.
"
"This is most strange,
[p]That she that even but now was your best object,
[p]The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
[p]Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
[p]Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
[p]So many folds of favour. Sure her offence
[p]Must be of such unnatural degree
[p]That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
[p]Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her
[p]Must be a faith that reason without miracle
[p]Should never plant in me.
"
"I yet beseech your Majesty,
[p]If for I want that glib and oily art
[p]To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,
[p]I'll do't before I speak- that you make known
[p]It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,
[p]No unchaste action or dishonoured step,
[p]That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;
[p]But even for want of that for which I am richer-
[p]A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
[p]As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
[p]Hath lost me in your liking.
"
"Better thou
[p]Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better.
"
"Is it but this- a tardiness in nature
[p]Which often leaves the history unspoke
[p]That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,
[p]What say you to the lady? Love's not love
[p]When it is mingled with regards that stands
[p]Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?
[p]She is herself a dowry.
"
"Royal Lear,
[p]Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,
[p]And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
[p]Duchess of Burgundy.
"
"Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.
"
"I am sorry then you have so lost a father
[p]That you must lose a husband.
"
"Peace be with Burgundy!
[p]Since that respects of fortune are his love,
[p]I shall not be his wife.
"
"Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
[p]Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!
[p]Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.
[p]Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
[p]Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
[p]My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.
[p]Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,
[p]Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.
[p]Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy
[p]Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.
[p]Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.
[p]Thou losest here, a better where to find.
"
"Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we
[p]Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
[p]That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
[p]Without our grace, our love, our benison.
[p]Come, noble Burgundy.
"
"Bid farewell to your sisters.
"
"The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
[p]Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are;
[p]And, like a sister, am most loath to call
[p]Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father.
[p]To your professed bosoms I commit him;
[p]But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
[p]I would prefer him to a better place!
[p]So farewell to you both.
"
"Prescribe not us our duties.
"
"Let your study
[p]Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you
[p]At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
[p]And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
"
"Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.
[p]Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
[p]Well may you prosper!
"
"Come, my fair Cordelia.
"
"Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly
[p]appertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night.
"
"That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
"
"You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we
[p]have made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd our
[p]sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her
[p]off appears too grossly.
"
"'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly
[p]known himself.
"
"The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then
[p]must we look to receive from his age, not alone the
[p]imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal
[p]the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with
[p]them.
"
"Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this
[p]of Kent's banishment.
"
"There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and
[p]him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry authority
[p]with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his
[p]will but offend us.
"
"We shall further think on't.
"
"We must do something, and i' th' heat.
"
"Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law
[p]My services are bound. Wherefore should I
[p]Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
[p]The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
[p]For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
[p]Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
[p]When my dimensions are as well compact,
[p]My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
[p]As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
[p]With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
[p]Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
[p]More composition and fierce quality
[p]Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
[p]Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops
[p]Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,
[p]Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.
[p]Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
[p]As to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'!
[p]Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
[p]And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
[p]Shall top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper.
[p]Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
"
"Kent banish'd thus? and France in choler parted?
[p]And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r?
[p]Confin'd to exhibition? All this done
[p]Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?
"
"So please your lordship, none.
"
"Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
"
"I know no news, my lord.
"
"What paper were you reading?
"
"Nothing, my lord.
"
"No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your
[p]pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide
[p]itself. Let's see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need
[p]spectacles.
"
"I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother
[p]that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have
[p]perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.
"
"Give me the letter, sir.
"
"I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as
[p]in part I understand them, are to blame.
"
"Let's see, let's see!
"
"I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as
[p]an essay or taste of my virtue.
"
"[reads] 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world
[p]bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us
[p]till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle
[p]and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways,
[p]not as it hath power, but as it is suffer'd. Come to me, that
[p]of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I
[p]wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live
[p]the beloved of your brother,
[p]                                                   'EDGAR.'
[p]Hum! Conspiracy? 'Sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy half
[p]his revenue.' My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart
[p]and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?
"
"It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it. I
[p]found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.
"
"You know the character to be your brother's?
"
"If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his;
[p]but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
"
"It is his.
"
"It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the
[p]contents.
"
"Hath he never before sounded you in this business?
"
"Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
[p]that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father
[p]should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
"
"O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred
[p]villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than
[p]brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him. Abominable
[p]villain! Where is he?
"
"I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend
[p]your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
[p]better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course;
[p]where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
[p]purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake
[p]in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
[p]for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
[p]honour, and to no other pretence of danger.
"
"Think you so?
"
"If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall
[p]hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your
[p]satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very
[p]evening.
"
"He cannot be such a monster.
"
"Nor is not, sure.
"
"To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.
[p]Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray
[p]you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
[p]myself to be in a due resolution.
"
"I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I
[p]shall find means, and acquaint you withal.
"
"These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to
[p]us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet
[p]nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. Love cools,
[p]friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in
[p]countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack'd
[p]'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
[p]prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from bias
[p]of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the best
[p]of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
[p]ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out
[p]this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
[p]carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his
[p]offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.    Exit.
"
"This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are
[p]sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make
[p]guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if
[p]we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
[p]knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;
[p]drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of
[p]planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine
[p]thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay
[p]his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father
[p]compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my
[p]nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and
[p]lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the
[p]maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.
[p]Edgar-
[p][Enter Edgar.]
[p]and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy. My
[p]cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam.
[p]O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.
"
"How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are you
[p]in?
"
"I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day,
[p]what should follow these eclipses.
"
"Do you busy yourself with that?
"
"I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as
[p]of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,
[p]dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,
[p]menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless
[p]diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,
[p]nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
"
"How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
"
"Come, come! When saw you my father last?
"
"The night gone by.
"
"Spake you with him?
"
"Ay, two hours together.
"
"Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by
[p]word or countenance
"
"None at all.
"
"Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at my
[p]entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
[p]qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so
[p]rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
[p]scarcely allay.
"
"Some villain hath done me wrong.
"
"That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till
[p]the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me
[p]to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my
[p]lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir abroad,
[p]go arm'd.
"
"Arm'd, brother?
"
"Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no honest man
[p]if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you what I
[p]have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and
[p]horror of it. Pray you, away!
"
"Shall I hear from you anon?
"
"I do serve you in this business.
[p][Exit Edgar.]
[p]A credulous father! and a brother noble,
[p]Whose nature is so far from doing harms
[p]That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
[p]My practices ride easy! I see the business.
[p]Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;
[p]All with me's meet that I can fashion fit. Exit.
"
"Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
"
"Ay, madam.
"
"By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour
[p]He flashes into one gross crime or other
[p]That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.
[p]His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
[p]On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
[p]I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
[p]If you come slack of former services,
[p]You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.
"
"He's coming, madam; I hear him.
"
"Put on what weary negligence you please,
[p]You and your fellows. I'd have it come to question.
[p]If he distaste it, let him to our sister,
[p]Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,
[p]Not to be overrul'd. Idle old man,
[p]That still would manage those authorities
[p]That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
[p]Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd
[p]With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd.
[p]Remember what I have said.
"
"Very well, madam.
"
"And let his knights have colder looks among you.
[p]What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.
[p]I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
[p]That I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister
[p]To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
"
"If but as well I other accents borrow,
[p]That can my speech defuse, my good intent
[p]May carry through itself to that full issue
[p]For which I raz'd my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
[p]If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
[p]So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,
[p]Shall find thee full of labours.
[p]    Horns within. Enter Lear, [Knights,] and Attendants.
"
"Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. [Exit
[p]an Attendant.] How now? What art thou?
"
"A man, sir.
"
"What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?
"
"I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly
[p]that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to
[p]converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear
[p]judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.
"
"What art thou?
"
"A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King.
"
"If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king, thou
[p]art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
"
"Service.
"
"Who wouldst thou serve?
"
"You.
"
"Dost thou know me, fellow?
"
"No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would
[p]fain call master.
"
"What's that?
"
"Authority.
"
"What services canst thou do?
"
"I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in
[p]telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which
[p]ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me
[p]is diligence.
"
"How old art thou?
"
"Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to
[p]dote on her for anything. I have years on my back forty-eight.
"
"Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after
[p]dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner!
[p]Where's my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither.
[p][Exit an attendant.]
[p][Enter [Oswald the] Steward.]
[p]You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?
"
"So please you-                                      Exit.
"
"What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
[p][Exit a Knight.] Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's
[p]asleep.
[p][Enter Knight]
[p]How now? Where's that mongrel?
"
"He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
"
"Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him?
"
"Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.
"
"He would not?
"
"My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgment
[p]your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious affection
[p]as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness appears
[p]as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also
[p]and your daughter.
"
"Ha! say'st thou so?
"
"I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for
[p]my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd.
"
"Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have
[p]perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather
[p]blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence
[p]and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. But
[p]where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days.
"
"Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool
[p]hath much pined away.
"
"No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my
[p]daughter I would speak with her. [Exit Knight.] Go you, call
[p]hither my fool.
[p][Exit an Attendant.]
[p][Enter [Oswald the] Steward.]
[p]O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?
"
"My lady's father.
"
"'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog! you
[p]slave! you cur!
"
"I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.
"
"Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
"
"I'll not be strucken, my lord.
"
"Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?
"
"I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love thee.
"
"Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences. Away,
[p]away! If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry; but
[p]away! Go to! Have you wisdom? So.
"
"Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of thy
[p]service.                  [Gives money.]
"
"Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb.
"
"How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?
"
"Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
"
"Why, fool?
"
"Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an thou
[p]canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly.
[p]There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two on's
[p]daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If
[p]thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now,
[p]nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
"
"Why, my boy?
"
"If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs myself.
[p]There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.
"
"Take heed, sirrah- the whip.
"
"Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out, when
[p]Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink.
"
"A pestilent gall to me!
"
"Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.
"
"Do.
"
"Mark it, nuncle.
[p]     Have more than thou showest,
[p]     Speak less than thou knowest,
[p]     Lend less than thou owest,
[p]     Ride more than thou goest,
[p]     Learn more than thou trowest,
[p]     Set less than thou throwest;
[p]     Leave thy drink and thy whore,
[p]     And keep in-a-door,
[p]     And thou shalt have more
[p]     Than two tens to a score.
"
"This is nothing, fool.
"
"Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave me
[p]nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?
"
"Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.
"
"[to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land
[p]comes to. He will not believe a fool.
"
"A bitter fool!
"
"Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter
[p]fool and a sweet fool?
"
"No, lad; teach me.
"
"That lord that counsell'd thee
[p]       To give away thy land,
[p]     Come place him here by me-
[p]       Do thou for him stand.
[p]     The sweet and bitter fool
[p]       Will presently appear;
[p]     The one in motley here,
[p]       The other found out there.
"
"Dost thou call me fool, boy?
"
"All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast
[p]born with.
"
"This is not altogether fool, my lord.
"
"No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had a
[p]monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too, they
[p]will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be
[p]snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two
[p]crowns.
"
"What two crowns shall they be?
"
"Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the
[p]meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i'
[p]th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass on
[p]thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
[p]when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in
[p]this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so.
[p][Sings]    Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,
[p]             For wise men are grown foppish;
[p]           They know not how their wits to wear,
[p]             Their manners are so apish.
"
"When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
"
"I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy daughters
[p]thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st down
[p]thine own breeches,
[p][Sings]    Then they for sudden joy did weep,
[p]             And I for sorrow sung,
[p]           That such a king should play bo-peep
[p]             And go the fools among.
[p]Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to
[p]lie. I would fain learn to lie.
"
"An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.
"
"I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll have me
[p]whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for lying;
[p]and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had rather be
[p]any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,
[p]nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing
[p]i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings.
"
"How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you
[p]are too much o' late i' th' frown.
"
"Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for
[p]her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am better
[p]than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.
[p][To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face
[p]bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum!
[p]       He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
[p]       Weary of all, shall want some.-
[p][Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod.
"
"Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
[p]But other of your insolent retinue
[p]Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth
[p]In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,
[p]I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
[p]To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,
[p]By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,
[p]That you protect this course, and put it on
[p]By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
[p]Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
[p]Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
[p]Might in their working do you that offence
[p]Which else were shame, that then necessity
[p]Must call discreet proceeding.
"
"For you know, nuncle,
[p]     The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
[p]     That it had it head bit off by it young.
[p]So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.
"
"Are you our daughter?
"
"Come, sir,
[p]I would you would make use of that good wisdom
[p]Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away
[p]These dispositions that of late transform you
[p]From what you rightly are.
"
"May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?
[p]Whoop, Jug, I love thee!
"
"Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.
[p]Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
[p]Either his notion weakens, his discernings
[p]Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!
[p]Who is it that can tell me who I am?
"
"Lear's shadow.
"
"I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,
[p]Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded
[p]I had daughters.
"
"Which they will make an obedient father.
"
"Your name, fair gentlewoman?
"
"This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour
[p]Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
[p]To understand my purposes aright.
[p]As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
[p]Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
[p]Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold
[p]That this our court, infected with their manners,
[p]Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust
[p]Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
[p]Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak
[p]For instant remedy. Be then desir'd
[p]By her that else will take the thing she begs
[p]A little to disquantity your train,
[p]And the remainder that shall still depend
[p]To be such men as may besort your age,
[p]Which know themselves, and you.
"
"Darkness and devils!
[p]Saddle my horses! Call my train together!
[p]Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;
[p]Yet have I left a daughter.
"
"You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble
[p]Make servants of their betters.
"
"Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?
[p]Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.
[p]Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
[p]More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
[p]Than the sea-monster!
"
"Pray, sir, be patient.
"
"[to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!
[p]My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
[p]That all particulars of duty know
[p]And in the most exact regard support
[p]The worships of their name.- O most small fault,
[p]How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
[p]Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
[p]From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love
[p]And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
[p]Beat at this gate that let thy folly in  [Strikes his head.]
[p]And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
"
"My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
[p]Of what hath mov'd you.
"
"It may be so, my lord.
[p]Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!
[p]Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
[p]To make this creature fruitful.
[p]Into her womb convey sterility;
[p]Dry up in her the organs of increase;
[p]And from her derogate body never spring
[p]A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
[p]Create her child of spleen, that it may live
[p]And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.
[p]Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
[p]With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,
[p]Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
[p]To laughter and contempt, that she may feel
[p]How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
[p]To have a thankless child! Away, away!                Exit.
"
"Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
"
"Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
[p]But let his disposition have that scope
[p]That dotage gives it.
"
"What, fifty of my followers at a clap?
[p]Within a fortnight?
"
"What's the matter, sir?
"
"I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd
[p]That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
[p]That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
[p]Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
[p]Th' untented woundings of a father's curse
[p]Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,
[p]Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
[p]And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
[p]To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?
[p]Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,
[p]Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.
[p]When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
[p]She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
[p]That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
[p]I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.
"
"Do you mark that, my lord?
"
"I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
[p]To the great love I bear you--
"
"Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho!
[p][To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master!
"
"Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee.
[p]     A fox when one has caught her,
[p]     And such a daughter,
[p]     Should sure to the slaughter,
[p]     If my cap would buy a halter.
[p]     So the fool follows after.    Exit.
"
"This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights?
[p]'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
[p]At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,
[p]Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
[p]He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs
[p]And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!
"
"Well, you may fear too far.
"
"Safer than trust too far.
[p]Let me still take away the harms I fear,
[p]Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.
[p]What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister.
[p]If she sustain him and his hundred knights,
[p]When I have show'd th' unfitness- [Enter [Oswald the] Steward.]
[p]How now, Oswald?
[p]What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
"
"Yes, madam.
"
"Take you some company, and away to horse!
[p]Inform her full of my particular fear,
[p]And thereto add such reasons of your own
[p]As may compact it more. Get you gone,
[p]And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord!
[p]This milky gentleness and course of yours,
[p]Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon,
[p]You are much more at task for want of wisdom
[p]Than prais'd for harmful mildness.
"
"How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.
[p]Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
"
"Nay then-
"
"Well, well; th' event.         Exeunt.
"
"Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint my
[p]daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her
[p]demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I
[p]shall be there afore you.
"
"I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter. Exit.
"
"If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger of
[p]kibes?
"
"Ay, boy.
"
"Then I prithee be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go slip-shod.
"
"Ha, ha, ha!
"
"Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for though
[p]she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell
[p]what I can tell.
"
"What canst tell, boy?
"
"She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou
[p]canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on's face?
"
"No.
"
"Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what a
[p]man cannot smell out, 'a may spy into.
"
"I did her wrong.
"
"Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
"
"No.
"
"Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
"
"Why?
"
"Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters,
[p]and leave his horns without a case.
"
"I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses
[p]ready?
"
"Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven stars
[p]are no moe than seven is a pretty reason.
"
"Because they are not eight?
"
"Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.
"
"To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
"
"If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for being
[p]old before thy time.
"
"How's that?
"
"Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.
"
"O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
[p]Keep me in temper; I would not be mad! [Enter a Gentleman.]
[p]How now? Are the horses ready?
"
"Ready, my lord.
"
"Come, boy.
"
"She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
[p]Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter
"
"Save thee, Curan.
"
"And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him
[p]notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will be
[p]here with him this night.
"
"How comes that?
"
"Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean the
[p]whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?
"
"Not I. Pray you, what are they?
"
"Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes
[p]of Cornwall and Albany?
"
"Not a word.
"
"You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir. Exit.
"
"The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!
[p]This weaves itself perforce into my business.
[p]My father hath set guard to take my brother;
[p]And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
[p]Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work!
[p]Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say!
[p][Enter Edgar.]
[p]My father watches. O sir, fly this place!
[p]Intelligence is given where you are hid.
[p]You have now the good advantage of the night.
[p]Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
[p]He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,
[p]And Regan with him. Have you nothing said
[p]Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
[p]Advise yourself.
"
"I am sure on't, not a word.
"
"I hear my father coming. Pardon me!
[p]In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.
[p]Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.-
[p]Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!
[p]Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.
[p][Exit Edgar.]
[p]Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
[p]Of my more fierce endeavour. [Stabs his arm.] I have seen
[p]   drunkards
[p]Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!-
[p]Stop, stop! No help?
"
"Now, Edmund, where's the villain?
"
"Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
[p]Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
[p]To stand 's auspicious mistress.
"
"But where is he?
"
"Look, sir, I bleed.
"
"Where is the villain, Edmund?
"
"Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-
"
"Pursue him, ho! Go after. [Exeunt some Servants].
[p]By no means what?
"
"Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;
[p]But that I told him the revenging gods
[p]'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
[p]Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
[p]The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine,
[p]Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
[p]To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion
[p]With his prepared sword he charges home
[p]My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;
[p]But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
[p]Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter,
[p]Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
[p]Full suddenly he fled.
"
"Let him fly far.
[p]Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
[p]And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master,
[p]My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.
[p]By his authority I will proclaim it
[p]That he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,
[p]Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;
[p]He that conceals him, death.
"
"When I dissuaded him from his intent
[p]And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
[p]I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,
[p]'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
[p]If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
[p]Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
[p]Make thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny
[p](As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce
[p]My very character), I'ld turn it all
[p]To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;
[p]And thou must make a dullard of the world,
[p]If they not thought the profits of my death
[p]Were very pregnant and potential spurs
[p]To make thee seek it.'
"
"Strong and fast'ned villain!
[p]Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
[p][Tucket within.]
[p]Hark, the Duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
[p]All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;
[p]The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture
[p]I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
[p]May have due note of him, and of my land,
[p]Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
[p]To make thee capable.
"
"How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither
[p](Which I can call but now) I have heard strange news.
"
"If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
[p]Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?
"
"O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
"
"What, did my father's godson seek your life?
[p]He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?
"
"O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
"
"Was he not companion with the riotous knights
[p]That tend upon my father?
"
"I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!
"
"Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
"
"No marvel then though he were ill affected.
[p]'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
[p]To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.
[p]I have this present evening from my sister
[p]Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions
[p]That, if they come to sojourn at my house,
[p]I'll not be there.
"
"Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
[p]Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
[p]A childlike office.
"
"'Twas my duty, sir.
"
"He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd
[p]This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.
"
"Is he pursued?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"If he be taken, he shall never more
[p]Be fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose,
[p]How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
[p]Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
[p]So much commend itself, you shall be ours.
[p]Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
[p]You we first seize on.
"
"I shall serve you, sir,
[p]Truly, however else.
"
"For him I thank your Grace.
"
"You know not why we came to visit you-
"
"Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.
[p]Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
[p]Wherein we must have use of your advice.
[p]Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
[p]Of differences, which I best thought it fit
[p]To answer from our home. The several messengers
[p]From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
[p]Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
[p]Your needful counsel to our business,
[p]Which craves the instant use.
"
"I serve you, madam.
[p]Your Graces are right welcome.
"
"Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?
"
"Ay.
"
"Where may we set our horses?
"
"I' th' mire.
"
"Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.
"
"I love thee not.
"
"Why then, I care not for thee.
"
"If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care for
[p]me.
"
"Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
"
"Fellow, I know thee.
"
"What dost thou know me for?
"
"A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,
[p]shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,
[p]worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking, whoreson,
[p]glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;
[p]one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of
[p]good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave,
[p]beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch;
[p]one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny the
[p]least syllable of thy addition.
"
"Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one
[p]that's neither known of thee nor knows thee!
"
"What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me!
[p]Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy heels
[p]before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for, though
[p]it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th'
[p]moonshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger!
[p]draw!
"
"Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
"
"Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King, and
[p]take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her father.
[p]Draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you
[p]rascal! Come your ways!
"
"Help, ho! murther! help!
"
"Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave!
[p]Strike!                                        [Beats him.]
"
"Help, ho! murther! murther!
"
"How now? What's the matter?                 Parts [them].
"
"With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I'll flesh ye!
[p]Come on, young master!
"
"Weapons? arms? What's the matter here?
"
"Keep peace, upon your lives!
[p]He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?
"
"The messengers from our sister and the King
"
"What is your difference? Speak.
"
"I am scarce in breath, my lord.
"
"No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You cowardly
[p]rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.
"
"Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?
"
"Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not have
[p]made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the trade.
"
"Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
"
"This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd
[p]At suit of his grey beard-
"
"Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if
[p]you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into
[p]mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my grey
[p]beard,' you wagtail?
"
"Peace, sirrah!
[p]You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
"
"Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.
"
"Why art thou angry?
"
"That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
[p]Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
[p]Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain
[p]Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
[p]That in the natures of their lords rebel,
[p]Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
[p]Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
[p]With every gale and vary of their masters,
[p]Knowing naught (like dogs) but following.
[p]A plague upon your epileptic visage!
[p]Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
[p]Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,
[p]I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
"
"What, art thou mad, old fellow?
"
"How fell you out? Say that.
"
"No contraries hold more antipathy
[p]Than I and such a knave.
"
"Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?
"
"His countenance likes me not.
"
"No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
"
"Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.
[p]I have seen better faces in my time
[p]Than stands on any shoulder that I see
[p]Before me at this instant.
"
"This is some fellow
[p]Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect
[p]A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
[p]Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he!
[p]An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth!
[p]An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
[p]These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
[p]Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
[p]Than twenty silly-ducking observants
[p]That stretch their duties nicely.
"
"Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
[p]Under th' allowance of your great aspect,
[p]Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
[p]On flickering Phoebus' front-
"
"What mean'st by this?
"
"To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I
[p]know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a plain
[p]accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,
[p]though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.
"
"What was th' offence you gave him?
"
"I never gave him any.
[p]It pleas'd the King his master very late
[p]To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
[p]When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,
[p]Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd
[p]And put upon him such a deal of man
[p]That worthied him, got praises of the King
[p]For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;
[p]And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
[p]Drew on me here again.
"
"None of these rogues and cowards
[p]But Ajax is their fool.
"
"Fetch forth the stocks!
[p]You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,
[p]We'll teach you-
"
"Sir, I am too old to learn.
[p]Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;
[p]On whose employment I was sent to you.
[p]You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
[p]Against the grace and person of my master,
[p]Stocking his messenger.
"
"Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
[p]There shall he sit till noon.
"
"Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!
"
"Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
[p]You should not use me so.
"
"Sir, being his knave, I will.
"
"This is a fellow of the selfsame colour
[p]Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!
"
"Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.
[p]His fault is much, and the good King his master
[p]Will check him for't. Your purpos'd low correction
[p]Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches
[p]For pilf'rings and most common trespasses
[p]Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill
[p]That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,
[p]Should have him thus restrain'd.
"
"I'll answer that.
"
"My sister may receive it much more worse,
[p]To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,
[p]For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-
[p][Kent is put in the stocks.]
[p]Come, my good lord, away.
"
"I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure,
[p]Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
[p]Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. I'll entreat for thee.
"
"Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.
[p]Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
[p]A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
[p]Give you good morrow!
"
"The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken. Exit.
"
"Good King, that must approve the common saw,
[p]Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st
[p]To the warm sun!
[p]Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
[p]That by thy comfortable beams I may
[p]Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles
[p]But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,
[p]Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
[p]Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time
[p]From this enormous state, seeking to give
[p]Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,
[p]Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
[p]This shameful lodging.
[p]Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.
"
"I heard myself proclaim'd,
[p]And by the happy hollow of a tree
[p]Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place
[p]That guard and most unusual vigilance
[p]Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,
[p]I will preserve myself; and am bethought
[p]To take the basest and most poorest shape
[p]That ever penury, in contempt of man,
[p]Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,
[p]Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,
[p]And with presented nakedness outface
[p]The winds and persecutions of the sky.
[p]The country gives me proof and precedent
[p]Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
[p]Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
[p]Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
[p]And with this horrible object, from low farms,
[p]Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,
[p]Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
[p]Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'
[p]That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am. Exit.
"
"'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
[p]And not send back my messenger.
"
"As I learn'd,
[p]The night before there was no purpose in them
[p]Of this remove.
"
"Hail to thee, noble master!
"
"Ha!
[p]Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?
"
"No, my lord.
"
"Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the
[p]head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and men
[p]by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears
[p]wooden nether-stocks.
"
"What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
[p]To set thee here?
"
"It is both he and she-
[p]Your son and daughter.
"
"No.
"
"Yes.
"
"No, I say.
"
"I say yea.
"
"No, no, they would not!
"
"Yes, they have.
"
"By Jupiter, I swear no!
"
"By Juno, I swear ay!
"
"They durst not do't;
[p]They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther
[p]To do upon respect such violent outrage.
[p]Resolve me with all modest haste which way
[p]Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,
[p]Coming from us.
"
"My lord, when at their home
[p]I did commend your Highness' letters to them,
[p]Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
[p]My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
[p]Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
[p]From Goneril his mistress salutations;
[p]Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
[p]Which presently they read; on whose contents,
[p]They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,
[p]Commanded me to follow and attend
[p]The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks,
[p]And meeting here the other messenger,
[p]Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine-
[p]Being the very fellow which of late
[p]Display'd so saucily against your Highness-
[p]Having more man than wit about me, drew.
[p]He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
[p]Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
[p]The shame which here it suffers.
"
"Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.
[p]     Fathers that wear rags
[p]       Do make their children blind;
[p]     But fathers that bear bags
[p]       Shall see their children kind.
[p]     Fortune, that arrant whore,
[p]     Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.
[p]But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy
[p]daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
"
"O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
[p]Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow!
[p]Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?
"
"With the Earl, sir, here within.
"
"Follow me not;
[p]Stay here.                         Exit.
"
"Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
"
"None.
[p]How chance the King comes with so small a number?
"
"An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question,
[p]thou'dst well deserv'd it.
"
"Why, fool?
"
"We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no
[p]labouring i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led by
[p]their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among twenty
[p]but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great
[p]wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following
[p]it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after.
[p]When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again. I
[p]would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
[p]     That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
[p]       And follows but for form,
[p]     Will pack when it begins to rain
[p]       And leave thee in the storm.
[p]     But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
[p]       And let the wise man fly.
[p]     The knave turns fool that runs away;
[p]       The fool no knave, perdy.
"
"Where learn'd you this, fool?
"
"Not i' th' stocks, fool.
[p]                 Enter Lear and Gloucester
"
"Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
[p]They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches-
[p]The images of revolt and flying off!
[p]Fetch me a better answer.
"
"My dear lord,
[p]You know the fiery quality of the Duke,
[p]How unremovable and fix'd he is
[p]In his own course.
"
"Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
[p]Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
[p]I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
"
"Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
"
"Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
[p]Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.
[p]Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
[p]Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-
[p]No, but not yet! May be he is not well.
[p]Infirmity doth still neglect all office
[p]Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves
[p]When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
[p]To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;
[p]And am fallen out with my more headier will,
[p]To take the indispos'd and sickly fit
[p]For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore
[p]Should he sit here? This act persuades me
[p]That this remotion of the Duke and her
[p]Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
[p]Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-
[p]Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,
[p]Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
[p]Till it cry sleep to death.
"
"I would have all well betwixt you. Exit.
"
"O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
"
"Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she
[p]put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs with
[p]a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that,
[p]in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.
"
"Good morrow to you both.
"
"Hail to your Grace!
"
"I am glad to see your Highness.
"
"Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
[p]I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,
[p]I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
[p]Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?
[p]Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,
[p]Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied
[p]Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!
[p][Lays his hand on his heart.]
[p]I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe
[p]With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!
"
"I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope
[p]You less know how to value her desert
[p]Than she to scant her duty.
"
"Say, how is that?
"
"I cannot think my sister in the least
[p]Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance
[p]She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
[p]'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
[p]As clears her from all blame.
"
"My curses on her!
"
"O, sir, you are old!
[p]Nature in you stands on the very verge
[p]Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led
[p]By some discretion that discerns your state
[p]Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you
[p]That to our sister you do make return;
[p]Say you have wrong'd her, sir.
"
"Ask her forgiveness?
[p]Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
[p]'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old. [Kneels.]
[p]Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg
[p]That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'
"
"Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.
[p]Return you to my sister.
"
"[rises] Never, Regan!
[p]She hath abated me of half my train;
[p]Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
[p]Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.
[p]All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall
[p]On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
[p]You taking airs, with lameness!
"
"Fie, sir, fie!
"
"You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
[p]Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
[p]You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,
[p]To fall and blast her pride!
"
"O the blest gods! so will you wish on me
[p]When the rash mood is on.
"
"No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
[p]Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
[p]Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine
[p]Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
[p]To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
[p]To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
[p]And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
[p]Against my coming in. Thou better know'st
[p]The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
[p]Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.
[p]Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,
[p]Wherein I thee endow'd.
"
"Good sir, to th' purpose.
"
"Who put my man i' th' stocks?
"
"What trumpet's that?
"
"I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,
[p]That she would soon be here.
[p][Enter [Oswald the] Steward.]
[p]Is your lady come?
"
"This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride
[p]Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
[p]Out, varlet, from my sight!
"
"What means your Grace?
"
"Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
[p]Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!
[p]If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
[p]Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,
[p]Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!
[p][To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-
[p]O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
"
"Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?
[p]All's not offence that indiscretion finds
[p]And dotage terms so.
"
"O sides, you are too tough!
[p]Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?
"
"I set him there, sir; but his own disorders
[p]Deserv'd much less advancement.
"
"You? Did you?
"
"I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
[p]If, till the expiration of your month,
[p]You will return and sojourn with my sister,
[p]Dismissing half your train, come then to me.
[p]I am now from home, and out of that provision
[p]Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
"
"Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
[p]No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
[p]To wage against the enmity o' th' air,
[p]To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-
[p]Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
[p]Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
[p]Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
[p]To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
[p]To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
[p]Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
[p]To this detested groom. [Points at Oswald.]
"
"At your choice, sir.
"
"I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.
[p]I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.
[p]We'll no more meet, no more see one another.
[p]But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
[p]Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
[p]Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,
[p]A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle
[p]In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.
[p]Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.
[p]I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot
[p]Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.
[p]Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;
[p]I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,
[p]I and my hundred knights.
"
"Not altogether so.
[p]I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
[p]For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
[p]For those that mingle reason with your passion
[p]Must be content to think you old, and so-
[p]But she knows what she does.
"
"Is this well spoken?
"
"I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?
[p]Is it not well? What should you need of more?
[p]Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
[p]Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house
[p]Should many people, under two commands,
[p]Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.
"
"Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
[p]From those that she calls servants, or from mine?
"
"Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,
[p]We could control them. If you will come to me
[p](For now I spy a danger), I entreat you
[p]To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more
[p]Will I give place or notice.
"
"I gave you all-
"
"And in good time you gave it!
"
"Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
[p]But kept a reservation to be followed
[p]With such a number. What, must I come to you
[p]With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?
"
"And speak't again my lord. No more with me.
"
"Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
[p]When others are more wicked; not being the worst
[p]Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with thee.
[p]Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
[p]And thou art twice her love.
"
"Hear, me, my lord.
[p]What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,
[p]To follow in a house where twice so many
[p]Have a command to tend you?
"
"What need one?
"
"O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars
[p]Are in the poorest thing superfluous.
[p]Allow not nature more than nature needs,
[p]Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:
[p]If only to go warm were gorgeous,
[p]Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st
[p]Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-
[p]You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
[p]You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
[p]As full of grief as age; wretched in both.
[p]If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
[p]Against their father, fool me not so much
[p]To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
[p]And let not women's weapons, water drops,
[p]Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!
[p]I will have such revenges on you both
[p]That all the world shall- I will do such things-
[p]What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be
[p]The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.
[p]No, I'll not weep.
[p]I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
[p]Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
[p]Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
"
"Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
"
"This house is little; the old man and 's people
[p]Cannot be well bestow'd.
"
"'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
[p]And must needs taste his folly.
"
"For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
[p]But not one follower.
"
"So am I purpos'd.
[p]Where is my Lord of Gloucester?
"
"Followed the old man forth.
[p][Enter Gloucester.]
[p]He is return'd.
"
"The King is in high rage.
"
"Whither is he going?
"
"He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.
"
"'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
"
"My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
"
"Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
[p]Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about
[p]There's scarce a bush.
"
"O, sir, to wilful men
[p]The injuries that they themselves procure
[p]Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.
[p]He is attended with a desperate train,
[p]And what they may incense him to, being apt
[p]To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.
"
"Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.
[p]My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm. [Exeunt.]
"
"Who's there, besides foul weather?
"
"One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
"
"I know you. Where's the King?
"
"Contending with the fretful elements;
[p]Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,
[p]Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,
[p]That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
[p]Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
[p]Catch in their fury and make nothing of;
[p]Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
[p]The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
[p]This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
[p]The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
[p]Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
[p]And bids what will take all.
"
"But who is with him?
"
"None but the fool, who labours to outjest
[p]His heart-struck injuries.
"
"Sir, I do know you,
[p]And dare upon the warrant of my note
[p]Commend a dear thing to you. There is division
[p](Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
[p]With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
[p]Who have (as who have not, that their great stars
[p]Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,
[p]Which are to France the spies and speculations
[p]Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,
[p]Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,
[p]Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
[p]Against the old kind King, or something deeper,
[p]Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings-
[p]But, true it is, from France there comes a power
[p]Into this scattered kingdom, who already,
[p]Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
[p]In some of our best ports and are at point
[p]To show their open banner. Now to you:
[p]If on my credit you dare build so far
[p]To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
[p]Some that will thank you, making just report
[p]Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
[p]The King hath cause to plain.
[p]I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,
[p]And from some knowledge and assurance offer
[p]This office to you.
"
"I will talk further with you.
"
"No, do not.
[p]For confirmation that I am much more
[p]Than my out-wall, open this purse and take
[p]What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia
[p](As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,
[p]And she will tell you who your fellow is
[p]That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
[p]I will go seek the King.
"
"Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?
"
"Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:
[p]That, when we have found the King (in which your pain
[p]That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him
[p]Holla the other.
"
"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
[p]You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
[p]Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
[p]You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,
[p]Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
[p]Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
[p]Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,
[p]Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,
[p]That makes ingrateful man!
"
"O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this
[p]rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters
[p]blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.
"
"Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
[p]Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.
[p]I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.
[p]I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
[p]You owe me no subscription. Then let fall
[p]Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,
[p]A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
[p]But yet I call you servile ministers,
[p]That will with two pernicious daughters join
[p]Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head
[p]So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!
"
"He that has a house to put 's head in has a good head-piece.
[p]     The codpiece that will house
[p]       Before the head has any,
[p]     The head and he shall louse:
[p]       So beggars marry many.
[p]     The man that makes his toe
[p]       What he his heart should make
[p]     Shall of a corn cry woe,
[p]       And turn his sleep to wake.
[p]For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a
[p]glass.
"
"No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
[p]I will say nothing.
"
"Who's there?
"
"Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a
[p]fool.
"
"Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night
[p]Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies
[p]Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
[p]And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,
[p]Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
[p]Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
[p]Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry
[p]Th' affliction nor the fear.
"
"Let the great gods,
[p]That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,
[p]Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
[p]That hast within thee undivulged crimes
[p]Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;
[p]Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue
[p]That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake
[p]That under covert and convenient seeming
[p]Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,
[p]Rive your concealing continents, and cry
[p]These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
[p]More sinn'd against than sinning.
"
"Alack, bareheaded?
[p]Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
[p]Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.
[p]Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house
[p](More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,
[p]Which even but now, demanding after you,
[p]Denied me to come in) return, and force
[p]Their scanted courtesy.
"
"My wits begin to turn.
[p]Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?
[p]I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
[p]The art of our necessities is strange,
[p]That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.
[p]Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
[p]That's sorry yet for thee.
"
"[sings]
[p]     He that has and a little tiny wit-
[p]       With hey, ho, the wind and the rain-
[p]     Must make content with his fortunes fit,
[p]        For the rain it raineth every day.
"
"True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.
"
"This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a
[p]prophecy ere I go:
[p]     When priests are more in word than matter;
[p]     When brewers mar their malt with water;
[p]     When nobles are their tailors' tutors,
[p]     No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
[p]     When every case in law is right,
[p]     No squire in debt nor no poor knight;
[p]     When slanders do not live in tongues,
[p]     Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
[p]     When usurers tell their gold i' th' field,
[p]     And bawds and whores do churches build:
[p]     Then shall the realm of Albion
[p]     Come to great confusion.
[p]     Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
[p]     That going shall be us'd with feet.
[p]This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time. Exit.
"
"Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing! When
[p]I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from me
[p]the use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetual
[p]displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any
[p]way sustain him.
"
"Most savage and unnatural!
"
"Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the Dukes,
[p]and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this
[p]night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter in
[p]my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be revenged
[p]home; there's part of a power already footed; we must incline to
[p]the King. I will seek him and privily relieve him. Go you and
[p]maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him
[p]perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. Though I
[p]die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old master
[p]must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund.
[p]Pray you be careful.               Exit.
"
"This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke
[p]Instantly know, and of that letter too.
[p]This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
[p]That which my father loses- no less than all.
[p]The younger rises when the old doth fall. Exit.
"
"Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.
[p]The tyranny of the open night 's too rough
[p]For nature to endure.
"
"Let me alone.
"
"Good my lord, enter here.
"
"Wilt break my heart?
"
"I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.
"
"Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
[p]Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;
[p]But where the greater malady is fix'd,
[p]The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;
[p]But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
[p]Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,
[p]The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind
[p]Doth from my senses take all feeling else
[p]Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
[p]Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
[p]For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!
[p]No, I will weep no more. In such a night
[p]To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
[p]In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
[p]Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!
[p]O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!
[p]No more of that.
"
"Good my lord, enter here.
"
"Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.
[p]This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
[p]On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
[p][To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-
[p]Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep. [Exit Fool]
[p]Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
[p]That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
[p]How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
[p]Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
[p]From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
[p]Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
[p]Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
[p]That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
[p]And show the heavens more just.
"
"[within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
"
"Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help me!
"
"Give me thy hand. Who's there?
"
"A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom.
"
"What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?
[p]Come forth.
"
"Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp hawthorn
[p]blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
"
"Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou come
[p]to this?
"
"Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led
[p]through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er
[p]bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
[p]halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud
[p]of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd
[p]bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five
[p]wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from
[p]whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity,
[p]whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and there-
[p]and there again- and there!
"
"What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
[p]Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?
"
"Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.
"
"Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
[p]Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
"
"He hath no daughters, sir.
"
"Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature
[p]To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
[p]Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
[p]Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
[p]Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot
[p]Those pelican daughters.
"
"Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo, loo!
"
"This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
"
"Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy word
[p]justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set not
[p]thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold.
"
"What hast thou been?
"
"A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my hair,
[p]wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart and
[p]did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake
[p]words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that
[p]slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine lov'd
[p]I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.
[p]False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox
[p]in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
[p]Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray
[p]thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy hand
[p]out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the foul
[p]fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says
[p]suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let
[p]him trot by.
"
"Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy
[p]uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than
[p]this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the beast
[p]no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's three
[p]on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself;
[p]unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked
[p]animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton
[p]here.
"
"Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to swim
[p]in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's
[p]heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. Look, here
[p]comes a walking fire.
"
"This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at curfew,
[p]and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin,
[p]squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white wheat,
[p]and hurts the poor creature of earth.
[p]      Saint Withold footed thrice the 'old;
[p]      He met the nightmare, and her nine fold;
[p]         Bid her alight
[p]         And her troth plight,
[p]      And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
"
"How fares your Grace?
"
"What's he?
"
"Who's there? What is't you seek?
"
"What are you there? Your names?
"
"Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the todpole,
[p]the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when
[p]the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows the
[p]old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the
[p]standing pool; who is whipp'd from tithing to tithing, and
[p]stock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had three suits to his
[p]back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to
[p]wear;
[p]     But mice and rats, and such small deer,
[p]     Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
[p]Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! peace, thou fiend!
"
"What, hath your Grace no better company?
"
"The prince of darkness is a gentleman!
[p]Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
"
"Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
[p]That it doth hate what gets it.
"
"Poor Tom 's acold.
"
"Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer
[p]T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.
[p]Though their injunction be to bar my doors
[p]And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
[p]Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out
[p]And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
"
"First let me talk with this philosopher.
[p]What is the cause of thunder?
"
"Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.
"
"I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
[p]What is your study?
"
"How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.
"
"Let me ask you one word in private.
"
"Importune him once more to go, my lord.
[p]His wits begin t' unsettle.
"
"Canst thou blame him? [Storm still.]
[p]His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!
[p]He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!
[p]Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,
[p]I am almost mad myself. I had a son,
[p]Now outlaw'd from my blood. He sought my life
[p]But lately, very late. I lov'd him, friend-
[p]No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,
[p]The grief hath craz'd my wits. What a night 's this!
[p]I do beseech your Grace-
"
"O, cry you mercy, sir.
[p]Noble philosopher, your company.
"
"Tom's acold.
"
"In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm.
"
"Come, let's in all.
"
"This way, my lord.
"
"With him!
[p]I will keep still with my philosopher.
"
"Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.
"
"Take him you on.
"
"Sirrah, come on; go along with us.
"
"Come, good Athenian.
"
"No words, no words! hush.
"
"Child Rowland to the dark tower came;
[p]His word was still
[p]     Fie, foh, and fum!
[p]     I smell the blood of a British man.
"
"I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
"
"How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to
[p]loyalty, something fears me to think of.
"
"I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil
[p]disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit, set
[p]awork by a reproveable badness in himself.
"
"How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!
[p]This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an
[p]intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens! that
[p]this treason were not- or not I the detector!
"
"Go with me to the Duchess.
"
"If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty
[p]business in hand.
"
"True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.
[p]Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our
[p]apprehension.
"
"[aside] If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff his
[p]suspicion more fully.- I will persever in my course of loyalty,
[p]though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.
"
"I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer
[p]father in my love.
"
"Here is better than the open air; take it thankfully. I will
[p]piece out the comfort with what addition I can. I will not be
[p]long from you.
"
"All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.
[p]The gods reward your kindness!
"
"Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the
[p]lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.
"
"Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a
[p]yeoman.
"
"A king, a king!
"
"No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he's a
[p]mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.
"
"To have a thousand with red burning spits
[p]Come hizzing in upon 'em-
"
"The foul fiend bites my back.
"
"He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's
[p]health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.
"
"It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
[p][To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.
[p][To the Fool] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she-foxes!
"
"Look, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at trial,
[p]madam?
[p]        Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me.
"
"Her boat hath a leak,
[p]        And she must not speak
[p]      Why she dares not come over to thee.
"
"The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale.
[p]Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring. Croak
[p]not, black angel; I have no food for thee.
"
"How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd.
[p]Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
"
"I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.
[p][To Edgar] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place.
[p][To the Fool] And thou, his yokefellow of equity,
[p]Bench by his side. [To Kent] You are o' th' commission,
[p]Sit you too.
"
"Let us deal justly.
[p]     Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
[p]       Thy sheep be in the corn;
[p]     And for one blast of thy minikin mouth
[p]       Thy sheep shall take no harm.
[p]Purr! the cat is gray.
"
"Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath before
[p]this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her father.
"
"Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?
"
"She cannot deny it.
"
"Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.
"
"And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
[p]What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
[p]Arms, arms! sword! fire! Corruption in the place!
[p]False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?
"
"Bless thy five wits!
"
"O pity! Sir, where is the patience now
[p]That you so oft have boasted to retain?
"
"[aside] My tears begin to take his part so much
[p]They'll mar my counterfeiting.
"
"The little dogs and all,
[p]Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.
"
"Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
[p]      Be thy mouth or black or white,
[p]      Tooth that poisons if it bite;
[p]      Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,
[p]      Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
[p]      Bobtail tyke or trundle-tail-
[p]      Tom will make them weep and wail;
[p]      For, with throwing thus my head,
[p]      Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
[p]Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and market
[p]towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
"
"Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about her
[p]heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard
[p]hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my
[p]hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments. You'll
[p]say they are Persian attire; but let them be chang'd.
"
"Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
"
"Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.
[p]So, so, so. We'll go to supper i' th' morning. So, so, so.
"
"And I'll go to bed at noon.
"
"Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?
"
"Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone.
"
"Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms.
[p]I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.
[p]There is a litter ready; lay him in't
[p]And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
[p]Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master.
[p]If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
[p]With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
[p]Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up!
[p]And follow me, that will to some provision
[p]Give thee quick conduct.
"
"Oppressed nature sleeps.
[p]This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
[p]Which, if convenience will not allow,
[p]Stand in hard cure. [To the Fool] Come, help to bear thy master.
[p]Thou must not stay behind.
"
"Come, come, away!
"
"When we our betters see bearing our woes,
[p]We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
[p]Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,
[p]Leaving free things and happy shows behind;
[p]But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip
[p]When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
[p]How light and portable my pain seems now,
[p]When that which makes me bend makes the King bow,
[p]He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!
[p]Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray
[p]When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
[p]In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.
[p]What will hap more to-night, safe scape the King!
[p]Lurk, lurk.                      [Exit.]
"
"[to Goneril] Post speedily to my lord your husband, show him
[p]this letter. The army of France is landed.- Seek out the traitor
[p]Gloucester.
"
"Hang him instantly.
"
"Pluck out his eyes.
"
"Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our sister
[p]company. The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous
[p]father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke where you
[p]are going, to a most festinate preparation. We are bound to the
[p]like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.
[p]Farewell, dear sister; farewell, my Lord of Gloucester. [Enter Oswald the Steward.]
[p]How now? Where's the King?
"
"My Lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence.
[p]Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
[p]Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
[p]Who, with some other of the lord's dependants,
[p]Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast
[p]To have well-armed friends.
"
"Get horses for your mistress.
"
"Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
"
"Edmund, farewell. [Exeunt Goneril, Edmund, and Oswald.]
[p]Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
[p]Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us. [Exeunt other Servants.]
[p]Though well we may not pass upon his life
[p]Without the form of justice, yet our power
[p]Shall do a court'sy to our wrath, which men
[p]May blame, but not control. [Enter Gloucester, brought in by two or three.]
[p]Who's there? the traitor?
"
"Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.
"
"Bind fast his corky arms.
"
"What mean, your Graces? Good my friends, consider
[p]You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.
"
"Bind him, I say.
"
"Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
"
"Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none.
"
"To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find-
"
"By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
[p]To pluck me by the beard.
"
"So white, and such a traitor!
"
"Naughty lady,
[p]These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
[p]Will quicken, and accuse thee. I am your host.
[p]With robber's hands my hospitable favours
[p]You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
"
"Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
"
"Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.
"
"And what confederacy have you with the traitors
[p]Late footed in the kingdom?
"
"To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?
[p]Speak.
"
"I have a letter guessingly set down,
[p]Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
[p]And not from one oppos'd.
"
"Cunning.
"
"And false.
"
"Where hast thou sent the King?
"
"To Dover.
"
"Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-
"
"Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
"
"I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.
"
"Wherefore to Dover, sir?
"
"Because I would not see thy cruel nails
[p]Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
[p]In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
[p]The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
[p]In hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up
[p]And quench'd the steeled fires.
[p]Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
[p]If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
[p]Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.'
[p]All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall see
[p]The winged vengeance overtake such children.
"
"See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
[p]Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
"
"He that will think to live till he be old,
[p]Give me some help!- O cruel! O ye gods!
"
"One side will mock another. Th' other too!
"
"If you see vengeance-
"
"Hold your hand, my lord!
[p]I have serv'd you ever since I was a child;
[p]But better service have I never done you
[p]Than now to bid you hold.
"
"How now, you dog?
"
"If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
[p]I'ld shake it on this quarrel.
"
"What do you mean?
"
"My villain!                               Draw and fight.
"
"Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
"
"Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?
[p]                   She takes a sword and runs at him behind.
"
"O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
[p]To see some mischief on him. O!                     He dies.
"
"Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
[p]Where is thy lustre now?
"
"All dark and comfortless! Where's my son Edmund?
[p]Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature
[p]To quit this horrid act.
"
"Out, treacherous villain!
[p]Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he
[p]That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
[p]Who is too good to pity thee.
"
"O my follies! Then Edgar was abus'd.
[p]Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
"
"Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
[p]His way to Dover. [Exit one with Gloucester.]
[p]How is't, my lord? How look you?
"
"I have receiv'd a hurt. Follow me, lady.
[p]Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave
[p]Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace.
[p]Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
"
"I'll never care what wickedness I do,
[p]If this man come to good.
"
"If she live long,
[p]And in the end meet the old course of death,
[p]Women will all turn monsters.
"
"Let's follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam
[p]To lead him where he would. His roguish madness
[p]Allows itself to anything.
"
"Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
[p]To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!
"
"Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
[p]Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
[p]The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
[p]Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.
[p]The lamentable change is from the best;
[p]The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,
[p]Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
[p]The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
[p]Owes nothing to thy blasts.
[p][Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.]
[p]But who comes here?
[p]My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
[p]But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
[p]Life would not yield to age.
"
"O my good lord,
[p]I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,
[p]These fourscore years.
"
"Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone.
[p]Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
[p]Thee they may hurt.
"
"You cannot see your way.
"
"I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
[p]I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen
[p]Our means secure us, and our mere defects
[p]Prove our commodities. Ah dear son Edgar,
[p]The food of thy abused father's wrath!
[p]Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
[p]I'ld say I had eyes again!
"
"How now? Who's there?
"
"[aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?
[p]I am worse than e'er I was.
"
"'Tis poor mad Tom.
"
"[aside] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not
[p]So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'
"
"Fellow, where goest?
"
"Is it a beggarman?
"
"Madman and beggar too.
"
"He has some reason, else he could not beg.
[p]I' th' last night's storm I such a fellow saw,
[p]Which made me think a man a worm. My son
[p]Came then into my mind, and yet my mind
[p]Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.
[p]As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods.
[p]They kill us for their sport.
"
"[aside] How should this be?
[p]Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
[p]Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!
"
"Is that the naked fellow?
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sake
[p]Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain
[p]I' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
[p]And bring some covering for this naked soul,
[p]Who I'll entreat to lead me.
"
"Alack, sir, he is mad!
"
"'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.
[p]Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.
[p]Above the rest, be gone.
"
"I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
[p]Come on't what will.               Exit.
"
"Sirrah naked fellow-
"
"Poor Tom's acold. [Aside] I cannot daub it further.
"
"Come hither, fellow.
"
"[aside] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
"
"Know'st thou the way to Dover?
"
"Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been
[p]scar'd out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man's son, from
[p]the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once: of
[p]lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
[p]stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and
[p]mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So,
[p]bless thee, master!
"
"Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
[p]Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched
[p]Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still!
[p]Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
[p]That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
[p]Because he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly;
[p]So distribution should undo excess,
[p]And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
"
"Ay, master.
"
"There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
[p]Looks fearfully in the confined deep.
[p]Bring me but to the very brim of it,
[p]And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
[p]With something rich about me. From that place
[p]I shall no leading need.
"
"Give me thy arm.
[p]Poor Tom shall lead thee.
"
"Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband
[p]Not met us on the way. [Enter Oswald the Steward.]
[p]Now, where's your master?
"
"Madam, within, but never man so chang'd.
[p]I told him of the army that was landed:
[p]He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming:
[p]His answer was, 'The worse.' Of Gloucester's treachery
[p]And of the loyal service of his son
[p]When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot
[p]And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out.
[p]What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
[p]What like, offensive.
"
"[to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.
[p]It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
[p]That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs
[p]Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
[p]May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.
[p]Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs.
[p]I must change arms at home and give the distaff
[p]Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
[p]Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear
[p](If you dare venture in your own behalf)
[p]A mistress's command. Wear this. [Gives a favour.]
[p]Spare speech.
[p]Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,
[p]Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
[p]Conceive, and fare thee well.
"
"Yours in the ranks of death!                        Exit.
"
"My most dear Gloucester!
[p]O, the difference of man and man!
[p]To thee a woman's services are due;
[p]My fool usurps my body.
"
"Madam, here comes my lord.       Exit.
"
"I have been worth the whistle.
"
"O Goneril,
[p]You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
[p]Blows in your face! I fear your disposition.
[p]That nature which contemns it origin
[p]Cannot be bordered certain in itself.
[p]She that herself will sliver and disbranch
[p]From her material sap, perforce must wither
[p]And come to deadly use.
"
"No more! The text is foolish.
"
"Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
[p]Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
[p]Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
[p]A father, and a gracious aged man,
[p]Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
[p]Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.
[p]Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
[p]A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
[p]If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
[p]Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
[p]It will come,
[p]Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
[p]Like monsters of the deep.
"
"Milk-liver'd man!
[p]That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
[p]Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
[p]Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
[p]Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
[p]Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
[p]France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
[p]With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,
[p]Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
[p]'Alack, why does he so?'
"
"See thyself, devil!
[p]Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
[p]So horrid as in woman.
"
"O vain fool!
"
"Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!
[p]Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitness
[p]To let these hands obey my blood,
[p]They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
[p]Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,
[p]A woman's shape doth shield thee.
"
"Marry, your manhood mew!
"
"What news?
"
"O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead,
[p]Slain by his servant, going to put out
[p]The other eye of Gloucester.
"
"Gloucester's eyes?
"
"A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
[p]Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
[p]To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,
[p]Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
[p]But not without that harmful stroke which since
[p]Hath pluck'd him after.
"
"This shows you are above,
[p]You justicers, that these our nether crimes
[p]So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester!
[p]Lose he his other eye?
"
"Both, both, my lord.
[p]This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.
[p]'Tis from your sister.
"
"[aside] One way I like this well;
[p]But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
[p]May all the building in my fancy pluck
[p]Upon my hateful life. Another way
[p]The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer. Exit.
"
"Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
"
"Come with my lady hither.
"
"He is not here.
"
"No, my good lord; I met him back again.
"
"Knows he the wickedness?
"
"Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him,
[p]And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
[p]Might have the freer course.
"
"Gloucester, I live
[p]To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King,
[p]And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend.
[p]Tell me what more thou know'st.
"
"Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the
[p]reason?
"
"Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his
[p]coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much
[p]fear and danger that his personal return was most required and
[p]necessary.
"
"Who hath he left behind him general?
"
"The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
"
"Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of
[p]grief?
"
"Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,
[p]And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
[p]Her delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queen
[p]Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,
[p]Sought to be king o'er her.
"
"O, then it mov'd her?
"
"Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove
[p]Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
[p]Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
[p]Were like, a better way. Those happy smilets
[p]That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
[p]What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence
[p]As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
[p]Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,
[p]If all could so become it.
"
"Made she no verbal question?
"
"Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father
[p]Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;
[p]Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters!
[p]Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night?
[p]Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook
[p]The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
[p]And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started
[p]To deal with grief alone.
"
"It is the stars,
[p]The stars above us, govern our conditions;
[p]Else one self mate and mate could not beget
[p]Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
"
"No.
"
"Was this before the King return'd?
"
"No, since.
"
"Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;
[p]Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
[p]What we are come about, and by no means
[p]Will yield to see his daughter.
"
"Why, good sir?
"
"A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,
[p]That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
[p]To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
[p]To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting
[p]His mind so venomously that burning shame
[p]Detains him from Cordelia.
"
"Alack, poor gentleman!
"
"Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
"
"'Tis so; they are afoot.
"
"Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear
[p]And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause
[p]Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.
[p]When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
[p]Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go
[p]Along with me.                   Exeunt.
"
"Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now
[p]As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud,
[p]Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
[p]With harlocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flow'rs,
[p]Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
[p]In our sustaining corn. A century send forth.
[p]Search every acre in the high-grown field
[p]And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.] What can man's
[p]   wisdom
[p]In the restoring his bereaved sense?
[p]He that helps him take all my outward worth.
"
"There is means, madam.
[p]Our foster nurse of nature is repose,
[p]The which he lacks. That to provoke in him
[p]Are many simples operative, whose power
[p]Will close the eye of anguish.
"
"All blest secrets,
[p]All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
[p]Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
[p]In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him!
[p]Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
[p]That wants the means to lead it.
"
"News, madam.
[p]The British pow'rs are marching hitherward.
"
"'Tis known before. Our preparation stands
[p]In expectation of them. O dear father,
[p]It is thy business that I go about.
[p]Therefore great France
[p]My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
[p]No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
[p]But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right.
[p]Soon may I hear and see him!
"
"But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?
"
"Ay, madam.
"
"Himself in person there?
"
"Madam, with much ado.
[p]Your sister is the better soldier.
"
"Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
"
"No, madam.
"
"What might import my sister's letter to him?
"
"I know not, lady.
"
"Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
[p]It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
[p]To let him live. Where he arrives he moves
[p]All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
[p]In pity of his misery, to dispatch
[p]His nighted life; moreover, to descry
[p]The strength o' th' enemy.
"
"I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
"
"Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.
[p]The ways are dangerous.
"
"I may not, madam.
[p]My lady charg'd my duty in this business.
"
"Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
[p]Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
[p]Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-
[p]Let me unseal the letter.
"
"Madam, I had rather-
"
"I know your lady does not love her husband;
[p]I am sure of that; and at her late being here
[p]She gave strange eyeliads and most speaking looks
[p]To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
"
"I, madam?
"
"I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.
[p]Therefore I do advise you take this note.
[p]My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,
[p]And more convenient is he for my hand
[p]Than for your lady's. You may gather more.
[p]If you do find him, pray you give him this;
[p]And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
[p]I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.
[p]So farewell.
[p]If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
[p]Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
"
"Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
[p]What party I do follow.
"
"Fare thee well.                Exeunt.
"
"When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?
"
"You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.
"
"Methinks the ground is even.
"
"Horrible steep.
[p]Hark, do you hear the sea?
"
"No, truly.
"
"Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
[p]By your eyes' anguish.
"
"So may it be indeed.
[p]Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st
[p]In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
"
"Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd
[p]But in my garments.
"
"Methinks y'are better spoken.
"
"Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful
[p]And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!
[p]The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
[p]Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down
[p]Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!
[p]Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
[p]The fishermen that walk upon the beach
[p]Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
[p]Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
[p]Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge
[p]That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes
[p]Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,
[p]Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
[p]Topple down headlong.
"
"Set me where you stand.
"
"Give me your hand. You are now within a foot
[p]Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon
[p]Would I not leap upright.
"
"Let go my hand.
[p]Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel
[p]Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods
[p]Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;
[p]Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
"
"Now fare ye well, good sir.
"
"With all my heart.
"
"[aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair
[p]Is done to cure it.
"
"O you mighty gods!                            He kneels.
[p]This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
[p]Shake patiently my great affliction off.
[p]If I could bear it longer and not fall
[p]To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
[p]My snuff and loathed part of nature should
[p]Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
[p]Now, fellow, fare thee well.
[p]                             He falls [forward and swoons].
"
"Gone, sir, farewell.-
[p]And yet I know not how conceit may rob
[p]The treasury of life when life itself
[p]Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,
[p]By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?
[p]Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-
[p]Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.
[p]What are you, sir?
"
"Away, and let me die.
"
"Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
[p]So many fadom down precipitating,
[p]Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;
[p]Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
[p]Ten masts at each make not the altitude
[p]Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
[p]Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.
"
"But have I fall'n, or no?
"
"From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
[p]Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far
[p]Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.
"
"Alack, I have no eyes!
[p]Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit
[p]To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort
[p]When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage
[p]And frustrate his proud will.
"
"Give me your arm.
[p]Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
"
"Too well, too well.
"
"This is above all strangeness.
[p]Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that
[p]Which parted from you?
"
"A poor unfortunate beggar.
"
"As I stood here below, methought his eyes
[p]Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea.
[p]It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,
[p]Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
[p]Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.
"
"I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear
[p]Affliction till it do cry out itself
[p]'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
[p]I took it for a man. Often 'twould say
[p]'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
"
"Bear free and patient thoughts.
[p]    Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds].
[p]But who comes here?
[p]The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
[p]His master thus.
"
"No, they cannot touch me for coming;
[p]I am the King himself.
"
"O thou side-piercing sight!
"
"Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press
[p]money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw me
[p]a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece
[p]of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it
[p]on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i'
[p]th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.
"
"Sweet marjoram.
"
"Pass.
"
"I know that voice.
"
"Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a dog,
[p]and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones
[p]were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and
[p]'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me
[p]once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would
[p]not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em
[p]out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I was
[p]everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof.
"
"The trick of that voice I do well remember.
[p]Is't not the King?
"
"Ay, every inch a king!
[p]When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
[p]I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
[p]Adultery?
[p]Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.
[p]The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly
[p]Does lecher in my sight.
[p]Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
[p]Was kinder to his father than my daughters
[p]Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
[p]To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
[p]Behold yond simp'ring dame,
[p]Whose face between her forks presageth snow,
[p]That minces virtue, and does shake the head
[p]To hear of pleasure's name.
[p]The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't
[p]With a more riotous appetite.
[p]Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
[p]Though women all above.
[p]But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
[p]Beneath is all the fiend's.
[p]There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;
[p]burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!
[p]Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my
[p]imagination. There's money for thee.
"
"O, let me kiss that hand!
"
"Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
"
"O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
[p]Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?
"
"I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?
[p]No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this
[p]challenge; mark but the penning of it.
"
"Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
"
"[aside] I would not take this from report. It is,
[p]And my heart breaks at it.
"
"Read.
"
"What, with the case of eyes?
"
"O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no
[p]money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse
[p]in a light. Yet you see how this world goes.
"
"I see it feelingly.
"
"What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes.
[p]Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond
[p]simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy,
[p]which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a
[p]farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
"
"Ay, sir.
"
"And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold
[p]the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.
[p]Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
[p]Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.
[p]Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
[p]For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
[p]Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
[p]Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
[p]And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
[p]Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.
[p]None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.
[p]Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
[p]To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes
[p]And, like a scurvy politician, seem
[p]To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!
[p]Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So.
"
"O, matter and impertinency mix'd!
[p]Reason, in madness!
"
"If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
[p]I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.
[p]Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;
[p]Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air
[p]We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.
"
"Alack, alack the day!
"
"When we are born, we cry that we are come
[p]To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.
[p]It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
[p]A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,
[p]And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
[p]Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
"
"O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,
[p]Your most dear daughter-
"
"No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
[p]The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
[p]You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;
[p]I am cut to th' brains.
"
"You shall have anything.
"
"No seconds? All myself?
[p]Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
[p]To use his eyes for garden waterpots,
[p]Ay, and laying autumn's dust.
"
"Good sir-
"
"I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!
[p]I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;
[p]My masters, know you that?
"
"You are a royal one, and we obey you.
"
"Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get it
[p]by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!
"
"A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
[p]Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter
[p]Who redeems nature from the general curse
[p]Which twain have brought her to.
"
"Hail, gentle sir.
"
"Sir, speed you. What's your will?
"
"Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
"
"Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that
[p]Which can distinguish sound.
"
"But, by your favour,
[p]How near's the other army?
"
"Near and on speedy foot. The main descry
[p]Stands on the hourly thought.
"
"I thank you sir. That's all.
"
"Though that the Queen on special cause is here,
[p]Her army is mov'd on.
"
"I thank you, sir
"
"You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;
[p]Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
[p]To die before you please!
"
"Well pray you, father.
"
"Now, good sir, what are you?
"
"A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,
[p]Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
[p]Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;
[p]I'll lead you to some biding.
"
"Hearty thanks.
[p]The bounty and the benison of heaven
[p]To boot, and boot!
"
"A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
[p]That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd flesh
[p]To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
[p]Briefly thyself remember. The sword is out
[p]That must destroy thee.
"
"Now let thy friendly hand
[p]Put strength enough to't.
"
"Wherefore, bold peasant,
[p]Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!
[p]Lest that th' infection of his fortune take
[p]Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
"
"Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion.
"
"Let go, slave, or thou diest!
"
"Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An chud
[p]ha' bin zwagger'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo long as
[p]'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th' old man. Keep out,
[p]che vore ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the
[p]harder. Chill be plain with you.
"
"Out, dunghill!
"
"Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your foins.
"
"Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.
[p]If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,
[p]And give the letters which thou find'st about me
[p]To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out
[p]Upon the British party. O, untimely death! Death!
"
"I know thee well. A serviceable villain,
[p]As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
[p]As badness would desire.
"
"What, is he dead?
"
"Sit you down, father; rest you.
[p]Let's see his pockets; these letters that he speaks of
[p]May be my friends. He's dead. I am only sorry
[p]He had no other deathsman. Let us see.
[p]Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.
[p]To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
[p]Their papers, is more lawful. Reads the letter.
[p]  'Let our reciprocal vows be rememb'red. You have many
[p]opportunities to cut him off. If your will want not, time and
[p]place will be fruitfully offer'd. There is nothing done, if he
[p]return the conqueror. Then am I the prisoner, and his bed my
[p]jail; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the
[p]place for your labour.
[p]      'Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant, 'Goneril.'
[p]O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!
[p]A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
[p]And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands
[p]Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
[p]Of murtherous lechers; and in the mature time
[p]With this ungracious paper strike the sight
[p]Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis well
[p]That of thy death and business I can tell.
"
"The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,
[p]That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
[p]Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.
[p]So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
[p]And woes by wrong imaginations lose
[p]The knowledge of themselves.
"
"Give me your hand.
[p]Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.
[p]Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend. Exeunt.
"
"O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work
[p]To match thy goodness? My life will be too short
[p]And every measure fail me.
"
"To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.
[p]All my reports go with the modest truth;
[p]Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.
"
"Be better suited.
[p]These weeds are memories of those worser hours.
[p]I prithee put them off.
"
"Pardon, dear madam.
[p]Yet to be known shortens my made intent.
[p]My boon I make it that you know me not
[p]Till time and I think meet.
"
"Then be't so, my good lord. [To the Doctor] How, does the King?
"
"Madam, sleeps still.
"
"O you kind gods,
[p]Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
[p]Th' untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up
[p]Of this child-changed father!
"
"So please your Majesty
[p]That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.
"
"Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
[p]I' th' sway of your own will. Is he array'd?
"
"Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep
[p]We put fresh garments on him.
"
"Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.
[p]I doubt not of his temperance.
"
"Very well.
"
"Please you draw near. Louder the music there!
"
"O my dear father, restoration hang
[p]Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss
[p]Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
[p]Have in thy reverence made!
"
"Kind and dear princess!
"
"Had you not been their father, these white flakes
[p]Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face
[p]To be oppos'd against the warring winds?
[p]To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
[p]In the most terrible and nimble stroke
[p]Of quick cross lightning? to watch- poor perdu!-
[p]With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
[p]Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
[p]Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
[p]To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,
[p]In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
[p]'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
[p]Had not concluded all.- He wakes. Speak to him.
"
"Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
"
"How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?
"
"You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.
[p]Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
[p]Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
[p]Do scald like molten lead.
"
"Sir, do you know me?
"
"You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?
"
"Still, still, far wide!
"
"He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.
"
"Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,
[p]I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity,
[p]To see another thus. I know not what to say.
[p]I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.
[p]I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd
[p]Of my condition!
"
"O, look upon me, sir,
[p]And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.
[p]No, sir, you must not kneel.
"
"Pray, do not mock me.
[p]I am a very foolish fond old man,
[p]Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
[p]And, to deal plainly,
[p]I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
[p]Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
[p]Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant
[p]What place this is; and all the skill I have
[p]Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
[p]Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
[p]For (as I am a man) I think this lady
[p]To be my child Cordelia.
"
"And so I am! I am!
"
"Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.
[p]If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
[p]I know you do not love me; for your sisters
[p]Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.
[p]You have some cause, they have not.
"
"No cause, no cause.
"
"Am I in France?
"
"In your own kingdom, sir.
"
"Do not abuse me.
"
"Be comforted, good madam. The great rage
[p]You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger
[p]To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
[p]Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more
[p]Till further settling.
"
"Will't please your Highness walk?
"
"You must bear with me.
[p]Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.
"
"Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
"
"Most certain, sir.
"
"Who is conductor of his people?
"
"As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
"
"They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of Kent
[p]in Germany.
"
"Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers of
[p]the kingdom approach apace.
"
"The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
[p]Fare you well, sir.              [Exit.]
"
"My point and period will be throughly wrought,
[p]Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought. Exit.
"
"Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,
[p]Or whether since he is advis'd by aught
[p]To change the course. He's full of alteration
[p]And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure.
"
"Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
"
"Tis to be doubted, madam.
"
"Now, sweet lord,
[p]You know the goodness I intend upon you.
[p]Tell me- but truly- but then speak the truth-
[p]Do you not love my sister?
"
"In honour'd love.
"
"But have you never found my brother's way
[p]To the forfended place?
"
"That thought abuses you.
"
"I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
[p]And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
"
"No, by mine honour, madam.
"
"I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,
[p]Be not familiar with her.
"
"Fear me not.
[p]She and the Duke her husband!
[p]  Enter, with Drum and Colours, Albany, Goneril, Soldiers.
"
"[aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
[p]Should loosen him and me.
"
"Our very loving sister, well bemet.
[p]Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,
[p]With others whom the rigour of our state
[p]Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
[p]I never yet was valiant. For this business,
[p]It toucheth us as France invades our land,
[p]Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,
[p]Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
"
"Sir, you speak nobly.
"
"Why is this reason'd?
"
"Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
[p]For these domestic and particular broils
[p]Are not the question here.
"
"Let's then determine
[p]With th' ancient of war on our proceeding.
"
"I shall attend you presently at your tent.
"
"Sister, you'll go with us?
"
"No.
"
"'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us.
"
"[aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.- I will go.
[p]     [As they are going out,] enter Edgar [disguised].
"
"If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor,
[p]Hear me one word.
"
"I'll overtake you.- Speak.
"
"Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
[p]If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
[p]For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,
[p]I can produce a champion that will prove
[p]What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
[p]Your business of the world hath so an end,
[p]And machination ceases. Fortune love you!
"
"Stay till I have read the letter.
"
"I was forbid it.
[p]When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
[p]And I'll appear again.
"
"Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.
"
"The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers.
[p]Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
[p]By diligent discovery; but your haste
[p]Is now urg'd on you.
"
"We will greet the time.          Exit.
"
"To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
[p]Each jealous of the other, as the stung
[p]Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
[p]Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
[p]If both remain alive. To take the widow
[p]Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
[p]And hardly shall I carry out my side,
[p]Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use
[p]His countenance for the battle, which being done,
[p]Let her who would be rid of him devise
[p]His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
[p]Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia-
[p]The battle done, and they within our power,
[p]Shall never see his pardon; for my state
[p]Stands on me to defend, not to debate. Exit.
"
"Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
[p]For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.
[p]If ever I return to you again,
[p]I'll bring you comfort.
"
"Grace go with you, sir!
"
"Away, old man! give me thy hand! away!
[p]King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.
[p]Give me thy hand! come on!
"
"No further, sir. A man may rot even here.
"
"What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
[p]Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
[p]Ripeness is all. Come on.
"
"And that's true too.          Exeunt.
"
"Some officers take them away. Good guard
[p]Until their greater pleasures first be known
[p]That are to censure them.
"
"We are not the first
[p]Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.
[p]For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
[p]Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.
[p]Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
"
"No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.
[p]We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.
[p]When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down
[p]And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,
[p]And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
[p]At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
[p]Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-
[p]Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out-
[p]And take upon 's the mystery of things,
[p]As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,
[p]In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones
[p]That ebb and flow by th' moon.
"
"Take them away.
"
"Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
[p]The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
[p]He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
[p]And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.
[p]The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,
[p]Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.
[p]Come. Exeunt [Lear and Cordelia, guarded].
"
"Come hither, Captain; hark.
[p]Take thou this note [gives a paper]. Go follow them to prison.
[p]One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost
[p]As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
[p]To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men
[p]Are as the time is. To be tender-minded
[p]Does not become a sword. Thy great employment
[p]Will not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't,
[p]Or thrive by other means.
"
"I'll do't, my lord.
"
"About it! and write happy when th' hast done.
[p]Mark- I say, instantly; and carry it so
[p]As I have set it down.
"
"I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
[p]If it be man's work, I'll do't.    Exit.
"
"Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,
[p]And fortune led you well. You have the captives
[p]Who were the opposites of this day's strife.
[p]We do require them of you, so to use them
[p]As we shall find their merits and our safety
[p]May equally determine.
"
"Sir, I thought it fit
[p]To send the old and miserable King
[p]To some retention and appointed guard;
[p]Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
[p]To pluck the common bosom on his side
[p]And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
[p]Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,
[p]My reason all the same; and they are ready
[p]To-morrow, or at further space, t' appear
[p]Where you shall hold your session. At this time
[p]We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
[p]And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd
[p]By those that feel their sharpness.
[p]The question of Cordelia and her father
[p]Requires a fitter place.
"
"Sir, by your patience,
[p]I hold you but a subject of this war,
[p]Not as a brother.
"
"That's as we list to grace him.
[p]Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
[p]Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,
[p]Bore the commission of my place and person,
[p]The which immediacy may well stand up
[p]And call itself your brother.
"
"Not so hot!
[p]In his own grace he doth exalt himself
[p]More than in your addition.
"
"In my rights
[p]By me invested, he compeers the best.
"
"That were the most if he should husband you.
"
"Jesters do oft prove prophets.
"
"Holla, holla!
[p]That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.
"
"Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
[p]From a full-flowing stomach. General,
[p]Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
[p]Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.
[p]Witness the world that I create thee here
[p]My lord and master.
"
"Mean you to enjoy him?
"
"The let-alone lies not in your good will.
"
"Nor in thine, lord.
"
"Half-blooded fellow, yes.
"
"[to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
"
"Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
[p]On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
[p]This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim, fair
[p]   sister,
[p]I bar it in the interest of my wife.
[p]'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
[p]And I, her husband, contradict your banes.
[p]If you will marry, make your loves to me;
[p]My lady is bespoke.
"
"An interlude!
"
"Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.
[p]If none appear to prove upon thy person
[p]Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
[p]There is my pledge [throws down a glove]! I'll prove it on thy
[p]   heart,
[p]Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
[p]Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
"
"Sick, O, sick!
"
"[aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
"
"There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the world
[p]   he is
[p]That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.
[p]Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,
[p]On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
[p]My truth and honour firmly.
"
"A herald, ho!
"
"A herald, ho, a herald!
"
"Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
[p]All levied in my name, have in my name
[p]Took their discharge.
"
"My sickness grows upon me.
"
"She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
[p]   [Exit Regan, led. Enter a Herald.]
[p]Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,
[p]And read out this.
"
"Sound, trumpet!                        A trumpet sounds.
"
"[reads] 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists of
[p]the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester,
[p]that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound
[p]of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'
"
"Sound!                                     First trumpet.
"
"Again!                                    Second trumpet.
"
"Again!                                     Third trumpet.
"
"Ask him his purposes, why he appears
[p]Upon this call o' th' trumpet.
"
"What are you?
[p]Your name, your quality? and why you answer
[p]This present summons?
"
"Know my name is lost;
[p]By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.
[p]Yet am I noble as the adversary
[p]I come to cope.
"
"Which is that adversary?
"
"What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
"
"Himself. What say'st thou to him?
"
"Draw thy sword,
[p]That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
[p]Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.
[p]Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
[p]My oath, and my profession. I protest-
[p]Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
[p]Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
[p]Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor;
[p]False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
[p]Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;
[p]And from th' extremest upward of thy head
[p]To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,
[p]A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
[p]This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent
[p]To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
[p]Thou liest.
"
"In wisdom I should ask thy name;
[p]But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
[p]And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
[p]What safe and nicely I might well delay
[p]By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.
[p]Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;
[p]With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
[p]Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-
[p]This sword of mine shall give them instant way
[p]Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
"
"Save him, save him!
"
"This is mere practice, Gloucester.
[p]By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
[p]An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,
[p]But cozen'd and beguil'd.
"
"Shut your mouth, dame,
[p]Or with this paper shall I stop it. [Shows her her letter to
[p]Edmund.]- [To Edmund]. Hold, sir.
[p][To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.
[p]No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it.
"
"Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.
[p]Who can arraign me for't?
"
"Most monstrous!
[p]Know'st thou this paper?
"
"Ask me not what I know.          Exit.
"
"Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.
"
"What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,
[p]And more, much more. The time will bring it out.
[p]'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
[p]That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
[p]I do forgive thee.
"
"Let's exchange charity.
[p]I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
[p]If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.
[p]My name is Edgar and thy father's son.
[p]The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
[p]Make instruments to scourge us.
[p]The dark and vicious place where thee he got
[p]Cost him his eyes.
"
"Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.
[p]The wheel is come full circle; I am here.
"
"Methought thy very gait did prophesy
[p]A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
[p]Let sorrow split my heart if ever I
[p]Did hate thee, or thy father!
"
"Worthy prince, I know't.
"
"Where have you hid yourself?
[p]How have you known the miseries of your father?
"
"By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
[p]And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
[p]The bloody proclamation to escape
[p]That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!
[p]That with the pain of death would hourly die
[p]Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
[p]Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance
[p]That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit
[p]Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
[p]Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
[p]Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;
[p]Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him
[p]Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd,
[p]Not sure, though hoping of this good success,
[p]I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
[p]Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart
[p](Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)
[p]'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
[p]Burst smilingly.
"
"This speech of yours hath mov'd me,
[p]And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;
[p]You look as you had something more to say.
"
"If there be more, more woful, hold it in;
[p]For I am almost ready to dissolve,
[p]Hearing of this.
"
"This would have seem'd a period
[p]To such as love not sorrow; but another,
[p]To amplify too much, would make much more,
[p]And top extremity.
[p]Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man,
[p]Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
[p]Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
[p]Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms
[p]He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out
[p]As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;
[p]Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
[p]That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting
[p]His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
[p]Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,
[p]And there I left him tranc'd.
"
"But who was this?
"
"Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
[p]Followed his enemy king and did him service
[p]Improper for a slave.
"
"Help, help! O, help!
"
"What kind of help?
"
"Speak, man.
"
"What means that bloody knife?
"
"'Tis hot, it smokes.
[p]It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!
"
"Who dead? Speak, man.
"
"Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister
[p]By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
"
"I was contracted to them both. All three
[p]Now marry in an instant.
"
"Here comes Kent.
"
"Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.
[p]                                   [Exit Gentleman.]
[p]This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble
[p]Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?
[p]The time will not allow the compliment
[p]That very manners urges.
"
"I am come
[p]To bid my king and master aye good night.
[p]Is he not here?
"
"Great thing of us forgot!
[p]Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?
[p]     [The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.]
[p]Seest thou this object, Kent?
"
"Alack, why thus?
"
"Yet Edmund was belov'd.
[p]The one the other poisoned for my sake,
[p]And after slew herself.
"
"Even so. Cover their faces.
"
"I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,
[p]Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
[p](Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ
[p]Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.
[p]Nay, send in time.
"
"Run, run, O, run!
"
"To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send
[p]Thy token of reprieve.
"
"Well thought on. Take my sword;
[p]Give it the Captain.
"
"Haste thee for thy life. [Exit Edgar.]
"
"He hath commission from thy wife and me
[p]To hang Cordelia in the prison and
[p]To lay the blame upon her own despair
[p]That she fordid herself.
"
"The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
"
"Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.
[p]Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
[p]That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
[p]I know when one is dead, and when one lives.
[p]She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.
[p]If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
[p]Why, then she lives.
"
"Is this the promis'd end?
"
"Or image of that horror?
"
"Fall and cease!
"
"This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,
[p]It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
[p]That ever I have felt.
"
"O my good master!
"
"Prithee away!
"
"'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
"
"A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
[p]I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!
[p]Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
[p]What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,
[p]Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.
[p]I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
"
"'Tis true, my lords, he did.
"
"Did I not, fellow?
[p]I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
[p]I would have made them skip. I am old now,
[p]And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
[p]Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.
"
"If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,
[p]One of them we behold.
"
"This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
"
"The same-
[p]Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?
"
"He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.
[p]He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.
"
"No, my good lord; I am the very man-
"
"I'll see that straight.
"
"That from your first of difference and decay
[p]Have followed your sad steps.
"
"You're welcome hither.
"
"Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
[p]Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
[p]And desperately are dead.
"
"Ay, so I think.
"
"He knows not what he says; and vain is it
[p]That we present us to him.
"
"Very bootless.
"
"Edmund is dead, my lord.
"
"That's but a trifle here.
[p]You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
[p]What comfort to this great decay may come
[p]Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,
[p]During the life of this old Majesty,
[p]To him our absolute power; [to Edgar and Kent] you to your
[p]   rights;
[p]With boot, and such addition as your honours
[p]Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste
[p]The wages of their virtue, and all foes
[p]The cup of their deservings.- O, see, see!
"
"And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
[p]Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
[p]And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
[p]Never, never, never, never, never!
[p]Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.
[p]Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!
[p]Look there, look there!                            He dies.
"
"He faints! My lord, my lord!
"
"Break, heart; I prithee break!
"
"Look up, my lord.
"
"Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him
[p]That would upon the rack of this tough world
[p]Stretch him out longer.
"
"He is gone indeed.
"
"The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.
[p]He but usurp'd his life.
"
"Bear them from hence. Our present business
[p]Is general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you
[p]   twain
[p]Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.
"
"I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.
[p]My master calls me; I must not say no.
"
"The weight of this sad time we must obey,
[p]Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
[p]The oldest have borne most; we that are young
[p]Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
"
"When shall we three meet again
[p]In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
"
"When the hurlyburly's done,
[p]When the battle's lost and won.
"
"That will be ere the set of sun.
"
"Where the place?
"
"Upon the heath.
"
"There to meet with Macbeth.
"
"I come, Graymalkin!
"
"Paddock calls.
"
"Anon.
"
"Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
[p]Hover through the fog and filthy air.
"
"What bloody man is that? He can report,
[p]As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
[p]The newest state.
"
"This is the sergeant
[p]Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
[p]'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
[p]Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
[p]As thou didst leave it.
"
"Doubtful it stood;
[p]As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
[p]And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
[p]Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
[p]The multiplying villanies of nature
[p]Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
[p]Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
[p]And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
[p]Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
[p]For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
[p]Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
[p]Which smoked with bloody execution,
[p]Like valour's minion carved out his passage
[p]Till he faced the slave;
[p]Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
[p]Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
[p]And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
"
"O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
"
"As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
[p]Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
[p]So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
[p]Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
[p]No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
[p]Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
[p]But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
[p]With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
[p]Began a fresh assault.
"
"Dismay'd not this
[p]Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
"
"Yes;
[p]As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
[p]If I say sooth, I must report they were
[p]As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
[p]Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
[p]Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
[p]Or memorise another Golgotha,
[p]I cannot tell.
[p]But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
"
"So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
[p]They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
[p][Exit Sergeant, attended]
[p]Who comes here?
"
"The worthy thane of Ross.
"
"What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
[p]That seems to speak things strange.
"
"God save the king!
"
"Whence camest thou, worthy thane?
"
"From Fife, great king;
[p]Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
[p]And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
[p]With terrible numbers,
[p]Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
[p]The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
[p]Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
[p]Confronted him with self-comparisons,
[p]Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
[p]Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
[p]The victory fell on us.
"
"Great happiness!
"
"That now
[p]Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
[p]Nor would we deign him burial of his men
[p]Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
[p]Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
"
"No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
[p]Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
[p]And with his former title greet Macbeth.
"
"I'll see it done.
"
"What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.
"
"Where hast thou been, sister?
"
"Killing swine.
"
"Sister, where thou?
"
"A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
[p]And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
[p]'Give me,' quoth I:
[p]'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
[p]Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
[p]But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
[p]And, like a rat without a tail,
[p]I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
"
"I'll give thee a wind.
"
"Thou'rt kind.
"
"And I another.
"
"I myself have all the other,
[p]And the very ports they blow,
[p]All the quarters that they know
[p]I' the shipman's card.
[p]I will drain him dry as hay:
[p]Sleep shall neither night nor day
[p]Hang upon his pent-house lid;
[p]He shall live a man forbid:
[p]Weary se'nnights nine times nine
[p]Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
[p]Though his bark cannot be lost,
[p]Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
[p]Look what I have.
"
"Show me, show me.
"
"Here I have a pilot's thumb,
[p]Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
"
"A drum, a drum!
[p]Macbeth doth come.
"
"The weird sisters, hand in hand,
[p]Posters of the sea and land,
[p]Thus do go about, about:
[p]Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
[p]And thrice again, to make up nine.
[p]Peace! the charm's wound up.
"
"So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
"
"How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
[p]So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
[p]That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
[p]And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
[p]That man may question? You seem to understand me,
[p]By each at once her chappy finger laying
[p]Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
[p]And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
[p]That you are so.
"
"Speak, if you can: what are you?
"
"All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
"
"All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!
"
"All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
"
"Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
[p]Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
[p]Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
[p]Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
[p]You greet with present grace and great prediction
[p]Of noble having and of royal hope,
[p]That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
[p]If you can look into the seeds of time,
[p]And say which grain will grow and which will not,
[p]Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
[p]Your favours nor your hate.
"
"Hail!
"
"Hail!
"
"Hail!
"
"Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
"
"Not so happy, yet much happier.
"
"Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
[p]So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
"
"Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
"
"Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
[p]By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
[p]But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
[p]A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
[p]Stands not within the prospect of belief,
[p]No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
[p]You owe this strange intelligence? or why
[p]Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
[p]With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
"
"The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
[p]And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
"
"Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
[p]As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
"
"Were such things here as we do speak about?
[p]Or have we eaten on the insane root
[p]That takes the reason prisoner?
"
"Your children shall be kings.
"
"You shall be king.
"
"And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
"
"To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
"
"The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
[p]The news of thy success; and when he reads
[p]Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
[p]His wonders and his praises do contend
[p]Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
[p]In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
[p]He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
[p]Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
[p]Strange images of death. As thick as hail
[p]Came post with post; and every one did bear
[p]Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
[p]And pour'd them down before him.
"
"We are sent
[p]To give thee from our royal master thanks;
[p]Only to herald thee into his sight,
[p]Not pay thee.
"
"And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
[p]He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
[p]In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
[p]For it is thine.
"
"What, can the devil speak true?
"
"The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
[p]In borrow'd robes?
"
"Who was the thane lives yet;
[p]But under heavy judgment bears that life
[p]Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
[p]With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
[p]With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
[p]He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
[p]But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
[p]Have overthrown him.
"
"[Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
[p]The greatest is behind.
[p][To ROSS and ANGUS]
[p]Thanks for your pains.
[p][To BANQUO]
[p]Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
[p]When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
[p]Promised no less to them?
"
"That trusted home
[p]Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
[p]Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
[p]And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
[p]The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
[p]Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
[p]In deepest consequence.
[p]Cousins, a word, I pray you.
"
"[Aside]. Two truths are told,
[p]As happy prologues to the swelling act
[p]Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
[p][Aside] This supernatural soliciting]
[p]Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
[p]Why hath it given me earnest of success,
[p]Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
[p]If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
[p]Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
[p]And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
[p]Against the use of nature? Present fears
[p]Are less than horrible imaginings:
[p]My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
[p]Shakes so my single state of man that function
[p]Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
[p]But what is not.
"
"Look, how our partner's rapt.
"
"[Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
[p]Without my stir.
"
"New horrors come upon him,
[p]Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
[p]But with the aid of use.
"
"[Aside] Come what come may,
[p]Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
"
"Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
"
"Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
[p]With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
[p]Are register'd where every day I turn
[p]The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
[p]Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
[p]The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
[p]Our free hearts each to other.
"
"Very gladly.
"
"Till then, enough. Come, friends.
"
"Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
[p]Those in commission yet return'd?
"
"My liege,
[p]They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
[p]With one that saw him die: who did report
[p]That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
[p]Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
[p]A deep repentance: nothing in his life
[p]Became him like the leaving it; he died
[p]As one that had been studied in his death
[p]To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
[p]As 'twere a careless trifle.
"
"There's no art
[p]To find the mind's construction in the face:
[p]He was a gentleman on whom I built
[p]An absolute trust.
[p][Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS]
[p]O worthiest cousin!
[p]The sin of my ingratitude even now
[p]Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
[p]That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
[p]To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
[p]That the proportion both of thanks and payment
[p]Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
[p]More is thy due than more than all can pay.
"
"The service and the loyalty I owe,
[p]In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
[p]Is to receive our duties; and our duties
[p]Are to your throne and state children and servants,
[p]Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
[p]Safe toward your love and honour.
"
"Welcome hither:
[p]I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
[p]To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
[p]That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
[p]No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
[p]And hold thee to my heart.
"
"There if I grow,
[p]The harvest is your own.
"
"My plenteous joys,
[p]Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
[p]In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
[p]And you whose places are the nearest, know
[p]We will establish our estate upon
[p]Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
[p]The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
[p]Not unaccompanied invest him only,
[p]But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
[p]On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
[p]And bind us further to you.
"
"The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
[p]I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
[p]The hearing of my wife with your approach;
[p]So humbly take my leave.
"
"My worthy Cawdor!
"
"[Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
[p]On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
[p]For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
[p]Let not light see my black and deep desires:
[p]The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,
[p]Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
"
"True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
[p]And in his commendations I am fed;
[p]It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
[p]Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
[p]It is a peerless kinsman.
"
"'They met me in the day of success: and I have
[p]learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
[p]them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
[p]to question them further, they made themselves air,
[p]into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
[p]the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
[p]all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
[p]before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
[p]me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
[p]shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
[p]thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
[p]mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
[p]ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
[p]to thy heart, and farewell.'
[p]Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
[p]What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
[p]It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
[p]To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
[p]Art not without ambition, but without
[p]The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
[p]That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
[p]And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
[p]That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
[p]And that which rather thou dost fear to do
[p]Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
[p]That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
[p]And chastise with the valour of my tongue
[p]All that impedes thee from the golden round,
[p]Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
[p]To have thee crown'd withal.
[p][Enter a Messenger]
[p]What is your tidings?
"
"The king comes here to-night.
"
"Thou'rt mad to say it:
[p]Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
[p]Would have inform'd for preparation.
"
"So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
[p]One of my fellows had the speed of him,
[p]Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
[p]Than would make up his message.
"
"Give him tending;
[p]He brings great news.
[p][Exit Messenger]
[p]The raven himself is hoarse
[p]That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
[p]Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
[p]That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
[p]And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
[p]Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
[p]Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
[p]That no compunctious visitings of nature
[p]Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
[p]The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
[p]And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
[p]Wherever in your sightless substances
[p]You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
[p]And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
[p]That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
[p]Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
[p]To cry 'Hold, hold!'
[p][Enter MACBETH]
[p]Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
[p]Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
[p]Thy letters have transported me beyond
[p]This ignorant present, and I feel now
[p]The future in the instant.
"
"My dearest love,
[p]Duncan comes here to-night.
"
"And when goes hence?
"
"To-morrow, as he purposes.
"
"O, never
[p]Shall sun that morrow see!
[p]Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
[p]May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
[p]Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
[p]Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
[p]But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
[p]Must be provided for: and you shall put
[p]This night's great business into my dispatch;
[p]Which shall to all our nights and days to come
[p]Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
"
"We will speak further.
"
"Only look up clear;
[p]To alter favour ever is to fear:
[p]Leave all the rest to me.
"
"This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
[p]Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
[p]Unto our gentle senses.
"
"This guest of summer,
[p]The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
[p]By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
[p]Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
[p]Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
[p]Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
[p]Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
[p]The air is delicate.
"
"See, see, our honour'd hostess!
[p]The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
[p]Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
[p]How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
[p]And thank us for your trouble.
"
"All our service
[p]In every point twice done and then done double
[p]Were poor and single business to contend
[p]Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
[p]Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
[p]And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
[p]We rest your hermits.
"
"Where's the thane of Cawdor?
[p]We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
[p]To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
[p]And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
[p]To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
[p]We are your guest to-night.
"
"Your servants ever
[p]Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
[p]To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
[p]Still to return your own.
"
"Give me your hand;
[p]Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
[p]And shall continue our graces towards him.
[p]By your leave, hostess.
"
"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
[p]It were done quickly: if the assassination
[p]Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
[p]With his surcease success; that but this blow
[p]Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
[p]But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
[p]We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
[p]We still have judgment here; that we but teach
[p]Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
[p]To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
[p]Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
[p]To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
[p]First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
[p]Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
[p]Who should against his murderer shut the door,
[p]Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
[p]Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
[p]So clear in his great office, that his virtues
[p]Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
[p]The deep damnation of his taking-off;
[p]And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
[p]Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
[p]Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
[p]Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
[p]That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
[p]To prick the sides of my intent, but only
[p]Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
[p]And falls on the other.
[p][Enter LADY MACBETH]
[p]How now! what news?
"
"He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?
"
"Hath he ask'd for me?
"
"Know you not he has?
"
"We will proceed no further in this business:
[p]He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
[p]Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
[p]Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
[p]Not cast aside so soon.
"
"Was the hope drunk
[p]Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
[p]And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
[p]At what it did so freely? From this time
[p]Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
[p]To be the same in thine own act and valour
[p]As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
[p]Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
[p]And live a coward in thine own esteem,
[p]Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
[p]Like the poor cat i' the adage?
"
"Prithee, peace:
[p]I dare do all that may become a man;
[p]Who dares do more is none.
"
"What beast was't, then,
[p]That made you break this enterprise to me?
[p]When you durst do it, then you were a man;
[p]And, to be more than what you were, you would
[p]Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
[p]Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
[p]They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
[p]Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
[p]How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
[p]I would, while it was smiling in my face,
[p]Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
[p]And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
[p]Have done to this.
"
"If we should fail?
"
"We fail!
[p]But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
[p]And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
[p]Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
[p]Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
[p]Will I with wine and wassail so convince
[p]That memory, the warder of the brain,
[p]Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
[p]A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
[p]Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
[p]What cannot you and I perform upon
[p]The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
[p]His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
[p]Of our great quell?
"
"Bring forth men-children only;
[p]For thy undaunted mettle should compose
[p]Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
[p]When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
[p]Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
[p]That they have done't?
"
"Who dares receive it other,
[p]As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
[p]Upon his death?
"
"I am settled, and bend up
[p]Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
[p]Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
[p]False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
"
"How goes the night, boy?
"
"The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
"
"And she goes down at twelve.
"
"I take't, 'tis later, sir.
"
"Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
[p]Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
[p]A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
[p]And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
[p]Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
[p]Gives way to in repose!
[p][Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch]
[p]Give me my sword.
[p]Who's there?
"
"A friend.
"
"What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
[p]He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
[p]Sent forth great largess to your offices.
[p]This diamond he greets your wife withal,
[p]By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
[p]In measureless content.
"
"Being unprepared,
[p]Our will became the servant to defect;
[p]Which else should free have wrought.
"
"All's well.
[p]I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
[p]To you they have show'd some truth.
"
"I think not of them:
[p]Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
[p]We would spend it in some words upon that business,
[p]If you would grant the time.
"
"At your kind'st leisure.
"
"If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
[p]It shall make honour for you.
"
"So I lose none
[p]In seeking to augment it, but still keep
[p]My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
[p]I shall be counsell'd.
"
"Good repose the while!
"
"Thanks, sir: the like to you!
"
"Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
[p]She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p]Is this a dagger which I see before me,
[p]The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
[p]I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
[p]Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
[p]To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
[p]A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
[p]Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
[p]I see thee yet, in form as palpable
[p]As this which now I draw.
[p]Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
[p]And such an instrument I was to use.
[p]Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
[p]Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
[p]And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
[p]Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
[p]It is the bloody business which informs
[p]Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
[p]Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
[p]The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
[p]Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
[p]Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
[p]Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
[p]With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
[p]Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
[p]Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
[p]Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
[p]And take the present horror from the time,
[p]Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
[p]Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
[p][A bell rings]
[p]I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
[p]Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
[p]That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
"
"That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
[p]What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
[p]Hark! Peace!
[p]It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
[p]Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
[p]The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
[p]Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
[p]their possets,
[p]That death and nature do contend about them,
[p]Whether they live or die.
"
"[Within] Who's there? what, ho!
"
"Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
[p]And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
[p]Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
[p]He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
[p]My father as he slept, I had done't.
[p][Enter MACBETH]
[p]My husband!
"
"I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
"
"I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
[p]Did not you speak?
"
"When?
"
"Now.
"
"As I descended?
"
"Ay.
"
"Hark!
[p]Who lies i' the second chamber?
"
"Donalbain.
"
"This is a sorry sight.
"
"A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
"
"There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
[p]'Murder!'
[p]That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
[p]But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
[p]Again to sleep.
"
"There are two lodged together.
"
"One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
[p]As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
[p]Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
[p]When they did say 'God bless us!'
"
"Consider it not so deeply.
"
"But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
[p]I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
[p]Stuck in my throat.
"
"These deeds must not be thought
[p]After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
"
"Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
[p]Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
[p]Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
[p]The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
[p]Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
[p]Chief nourisher in life's feast,--
"
"What do you mean?
"
"Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
[p]'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
[p]Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
"
"Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
[p]You do unbend your noble strength, to think
[p]So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
[p]And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
[p]Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
[p]They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
[p]The sleepy grooms with blood.
"
"I'll go no more:
[p]I am afraid to think what I have done;
[p]Look on't again I dare not.
"
"Infirm of purpose!
[p]Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
[p]Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
[p]That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
[p]I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
[p]For it must seem their guilt.
"
"Whence is that knocking?
[p]How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
[p]What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
[p]Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
[p]Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
[p]The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
[p]Making the green one red.
"
"My hands are of your colour; but I shame
[p]To wear a heart so white.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]I hear a knocking
[p]At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
[p]A little water clears us of this deed:
[p]How easy is it, then! Your constancy
[p]Hath left you unattended.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Hark! more knocking.
[p]Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
[p]And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
[p]So poorly in your thoughts.
"
"To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
"
"Here's a knocking indeed! If a
[p]man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
[p]old turning the key.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Knock,
[p]knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
[p]Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
[p]himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
[p]time; have napkins enow about you; here
[p]you'll sweat for't.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Knock,
[p]knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
[p]name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
[p]swear in both the scales against either scale;
[p]who committed treason enough for God's sake,
[p]yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
[p]in, equivocator.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Knock,
[p]knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
[p]English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
[p]a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
[p]roast your goose.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Knock,
[p]knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
[p]this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
[p]it no further: I had thought to have let in
[p]some of all professions that go the primrose
[p]way to the everlasting bonfire.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.
"
"Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
[p]That you do lie so late?
"
"'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
[p]second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
[p]provoker of three things.
"
"What three things does drink especially provoke?
"
"Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
[p]urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
[p]it provokes the desire, but it takes
[p]away the performance: therefore, much drink
[p]may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
[p]it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
[p]him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
[p]and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
[p]not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
[p]in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
"
"I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
"
"That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
[p]me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
[p]think, being too strong for him, though he took
[p]up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
[p]him.
"
"Is thy master stirring?
[p][Enter MACBETH]
[p]Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
"
"Good morrow, noble sir.
"
"Good morrow, both.
"
"Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
"
"Not yet.
"
"He did command me to call timely on him:
[p]I have almost slipp'd the hour.
"
"I'll bring you to him.
"
"I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
[p]But yet 'tis one.
"
"The labour we delight in physics pain.
[p]This is the door.
"
"I'll make so bold to call,
[p]For 'tis my limited service.
"
"Goes the king hence to-day?
"
"He does: he did appoint so.
"
"The night has been unruly: where we lay,
[p]Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
[p]Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
[p]And prophesying with accents terrible
[p]Of dire combustion and confused events
[p]New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
[p]Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
[p]Was feverous and did shake.
"
"'Twas a rough night.
"
"My young remembrance cannot parallel
[p]A fellow to it.
"
"O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
[p]Cannot conceive nor name thee!
"
"[with Lennox] What's the matter.
"
"Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
[p]Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
[p]The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
[p]The life o' the building!
"
"What is 't you say? the life?
"
"Mean you his majesty?
"
"Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
[p]With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
[p]See, and then speak yourselves.
[p][Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX]
[p]Awake, awake!
[p]Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
[p]Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
[p]Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
[p]And look on death itself! up, up, and see
[p]The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
[p]As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
[p]To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
"
"What's the business,
[p]That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
[p]The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!
"
"O gentle lady,
[p]'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
[p]The repetition, in a woman's ear,
[p]Would murder as it fell.
[p][Enter BANQUO]
[p]O Banquo, Banquo,
[p]Our royal master 's murder'd!
"
"Woe, alas!
[p]What, in our house?
"
"Too cruel any where.
[p]Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
[p]And say it is not so.
"
"Had I but died an hour before this chance,
[p]I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
[p]There 's nothing serious in mortality:
[p]All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
[p]The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
[p]Is left this vault to brag of.
"
"What is amiss?
"
"You are, and do not know't:
[p]The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
[p]Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.
"
"Your royal father 's murder'd.
"
"O, by whom?
"
"Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
[p]Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
[p]So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
[p]Upon their pillows:
[p]They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
[p]Was to be trusted with them.
"
"O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
[p]That I did kill them.
"
"Wherefore did you so?
"
"Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
[p]Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
[p]The expedition my violent love
[p]Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
[p]His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
[p]And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
[p]For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
[p]Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
[p]Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
[p]That had a heart to love, and in that heart
[p]Courage to make 's love known?
"
"Help me hence, ho!
"
"Look to the lady.
"
"[Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,
[p]That most may claim this argument for ours?
"
"[Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,
[p]where our fate,
[p]Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
[p]Let 's away;
[p]Our tears are not yet brew'd.
"
"[Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow
[p]Upon the foot of motion.
"
"Look to the lady:
[p][LADY MACBETH is carried out]
[p]And when we have our naked frailties hid,
[p]That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
[p]And question this most bloody piece of work,
[p]To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
[p]In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
[p]Against the undivulged pretence I fight
[p]Of treasonous malice.
"
"And so do I.
"
"So all.
"
"Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
[p]And meet i' the hall together.
"
"Well contented.
"
"What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
[p]To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
[p]Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
"
"To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
[p]Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
[p]There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
[p]The nearer bloody.
"
"This murderous shaft that's shot
[p]Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
[p]Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
[p]And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
[p]But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
[p]Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.
"
"Threescore and ten I can remember well:
[p]Within the volume of which time I have seen
[p]Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
[p]Hath trifled former knowings.
"
"Ah, good father,
[p]Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
[p]Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
[p]And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
[p]Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
[p]That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
[p]When living light should kiss it?
"
"'Tis unnatural,
[p]Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
[p]A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
[p]Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
"
"And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
[p]Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
[p]Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
[p]Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
[p]War with mankind.
"
"'Tis said they eat each other.
"
"They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
[p]That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
[p][Enter MACDUFF]
[p]How goes the world, sir, now?
"
"Why, see you not?
"
"Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
"
"Those that Macbeth hath slain.
"
"Alas, the day!
[p]What good could they pretend?
"
"They were suborn'd:
[p]Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
[p]Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
[p]Suspicion of the deed.
"
"'Gainst nature still!
[p]Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
[p]Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
[p]The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
"
"He is already named, and gone to Scone
[p]To be invested.
"
"Where is Duncan's body?
"
"Carried to Colmekill,
[p]The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
[p]And guardian of their bones.
"
"Will you to Scone?
"
"No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
"
"Well, I will thither.
"
"Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
[p]Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
"
"Farewell, father.
"
"God's benison go with you; and with those
[p]That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!
"
"Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
[p]As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
[p]Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
[p]It should not stand in thy posterity,
[p]But that myself should be the root and father
[p]Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
[p]As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
[p]Why, by the verities on thee made good,
[p]May they not be my oracles as well,
[p]And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.
[p][Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY]
[p]MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants]
"
"Here's our chief guest.
"
"If he had been forgotten,
[p]It had been as a gap in our great feast,
[p]And all-thing unbecoming.
"
"To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
[p]And I'll request your presence.
"
"Let your highness
[p]Command upon me; to the which my duties
[p]Are with a most indissoluble tie
[p]For ever knit.
"
"Ride you this afternoon?
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"We should have else desired your good advice,
[p]Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
[p]In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
[p]Is't far you ride?
"
"As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
[p]'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
[p]I must become a borrower of the night
[p]For a dark hour or twain.
"
"Fail not our feast.
"
"My lord, I will not.
"
"We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
[p]In England and in Ireland, not confessing
[p]Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
[p]With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
[p]When therewithal we shall have cause of state
[p]Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
[p]Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?
"
"Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.
"
"I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
[p]And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.
[p][Exit BANQUO]
[p]Let every man be master of his time
[p]Till seven at night: to make society
[p]The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
[p]Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!
[p][Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant]
[p]Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
[p]Our pleasure?
"
"They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
"
"Bring them before us.
[p][Exit Attendant]
[p]To be thus is nothing;
[p]But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
[p]Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
[p]Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
[p]And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
[p]He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
[p]To act in safety. There is none but he
[p]Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
[p]My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
[p]Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
[p]When first they put the name of king upon me,
[p]And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
[p]They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
[p]Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
[p]And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
[p]Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
[p]No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
[p]For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
[p]For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
[p]Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
[p]Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
[p]Given to the common enemy of man,
[p]To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
[p]Rather than so, come fate into the list.
[p]And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!
[p][Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers]
[p]Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
[p][Exit Attendant]
[p]Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
"
"It was, so please your highness.
"
"Well then, now
[p]Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
[p]That it was he in the times past which held you
[p]So under fortune, which you thought had been
[p]Our innocent self: this I made good to you
[p]In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
[p]How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
[p]the instruments,
[p]Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
[p]To half a soul and to a notion crazed
[p]Say 'Thus did Banquo.'
"
"You made it known to us.
"
"I did so, and went further, which is now
[p]Our point of second meeting. Do you find
[p]Your patience so predominant in your nature
[p]That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
[p]To pray for this good man and for his issue,
[p]Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
[p]And beggar'd yours for ever?
"
"We are men, my liege.
"
"Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
[p]As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
[p]Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
[p]All by the name of dogs: the valued file
[p]Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
[p]The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
[p]According to the gift which bounteous nature
[p]Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
[p]Particular addition. from the bill
[p]That writes them all alike: and so of men.
[p]Now, if you have a station in the file,
[p]Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
[p]And I will put that business in your bosoms,
[p]Whose execution takes your enemy off,
[p]Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
[p]Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
[p]Which in his death were perfect.
"
"I am one, my liege,
[p]Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
[p]Have so incensed that I am reckless what
[p]I do to spite the world.
"
"And I another
[p]So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
[p]That I would set my lie on any chance,
[p]To mend it, or be rid on't.
"
"Both of you
[p]Know Banquo was your enemy.
"
"[with Second Murderer] True, my lord.
"
"So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
[p]That every minute of his being thrusts
[p]Against my near'st of life: and though I could
[p]With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
[p]And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
[p]For certain friends that are both his and mine,
[p]Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
[p]Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
[p]That I to your assistance do make love,
[p]Masking the business from the common eye
[p]For sundry weighty reasons.
"
"We shall, my lord,
[p]Perform what you command us.
"
"Though our lives--
"
"Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
[p]I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
[p]Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
[p]The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
[p]And something from the palace; always thought
[p]That I require a clearness: and with him--
[p]To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
[p]Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
[p]Whose absence is no less material to me
[p]Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
[p]Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
[p]I'll come to you anon.
"
"[With Second Murderer] We are resolved, my lord.
"
"I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
[p][Exeunt Murderers]
[p]It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
[p]If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.
"
"Is Banquo gone from court?
"
"Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.
"
"Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
[p]For a few words.
"
"Madam, I will.
"
"Nought's had, all's spent,
[p]Where our desire is got without content:
[p]'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
[p]Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
[p][Enter MACBETH]
[p]How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
[p]Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
[p]Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
[p]With them they think on? Things without all remedy
[p]Should be without regard: what's done is done.
"
"We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
[p]She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
[p]Remains in danger of her former tooth.
[p]But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
[p]worlds suffer,
[p]Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
[p]In the affliction of these terrible dreams
[p]That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
[p]Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
[p]Than on the torture of the mind to lie
[p]In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
[p]After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
[p]Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
[p]Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
[p]Can touch him further.
"
"Come on;
[p]Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
[p]Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
"
"So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
[p]Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
[p]Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
[p]Unsafe the while, that we
[p]Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
[p]And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
[p]Disguising what they are.
"
"You must leave this.
"
"O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
[p]Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
"
"But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
"
"There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
[p]Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
[p]His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
[p]The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
[p]Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
[p]A deed of dreadful note.
"
"What's to be done?
"
"Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
[p]Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
[p]Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
[p]And with thy bloody and invisible hand
[p]Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
[p]Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
[p]Makes wing to the rooky wood:
[p]Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
[p]While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
[p]Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
[p]Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
[p]So, prithee, go with me.
"
"But who did bid thee join with us?
"
"Macbeth.
"
"He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
[p]Our offices and what we have to do
[p]To the direction just.
"
"Then stand with us.
[p]The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
[p]Now spurs the lated traveller apace
[p]To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
[p]The subject of our watch.
"
"Hark! I hear horses.
"
"[Within] Give us a light there, ho!
"
"Then 'tis he: the rest
[p]That are within the note of expectation
[p]Already are i' the court.
"
"His horses go about.
"
"Almost a mile: but he does usually,
[p]So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
[p]Make it their walk.
"
"A light, a light!
"
"'Tis he.
"
"Stand to't.
"
"It will be rain to-night.
"
"Let it come down.
"
"O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
[p]Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
"
"Who did strike out the light?
"
"Wast not the way?
"
"There's but one down; the son is fled.
"
"We have lost
[p]Best half of our affair.
"
"Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
"
"You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
[p]And last the hearty welcome.
"
"Thanks to your majesty.
"
"Ourself will mingle with society,
[p]And play the humble host.
[p]Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
[p]We will require her welcome.
"
"Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
[p]For my heart speaks they are welcome.
"
"See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
[p]Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
[p]Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
[p]The table round.
[p][Approaching the door]
[p]There's blood on thy face.
"
"'Tis Banquo's then.
"
"'Tis better thee without than he within.
[p]Is he dispatch'd?
"
"My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.
"
"Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
[p]That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
[p]Thou art the nonpareil.
"
"Most royal sir,
[p]Fleance is 'scaped.
"
"Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
[p]Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
[p]As broad and general as the casing air:
[p]But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
[p]To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?
"
"Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
[p]With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
[p]The least a death to nature.
"
"Thanks for that:
[p]There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
[p]Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
[p]No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
[p]We'll hear, ourselves, again.
"
"My royal lord,
[p]You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
[p]That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
[p]'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
[p]From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
[p]Meeting were bare without it.
"
"Sweet remembrancer!
[p]Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
[p]And health on both!
"
"May't please your highness sit.
[p][The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in]
[p]MACBETH's place]
"
"Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
[p]Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
[p]Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
[p]Than pity for mischance!
"
"His absence, sir,
[p]Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
[p]To grace us with your royal company.
"
"The table's full.
"
"Here is a place reserved, sir.
"
"Where?
"
"Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?
"
"Which of you have done this?
"
"What, my good lord?
"
"Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
[p]Thy gory locks at me.
"
"Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.
"
"Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
[p]And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
[p]The fit is momentary; upon a thought
[p]He will again be well: if much you note him,
[p]You shall offend him and extend his passion:
[p]Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
"
"Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
[p]Which might appal the devil.
"
"O proper stuff!
[p]This is the very painting of your fear:
[p]This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
[p]Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
[p]Impostors to true fear, would well become
[p]A woman's story at a winter's fire,
[p]Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
[p]Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
[p]You look but on a stool.
"
"Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
[p]how say you?
[p]Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
[p]If charnel-houses and our graves must send
[p]Those that we bury back, our monuments
[p]Shall be the maws of kites.
"
"What, quite unmann'd in folly?
"
"If I stand here, I saw him.
"
"Fie, for shame!
"
"Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
[p]Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;
[p]Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
[p]Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
[p]That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
[p]And there an end; but now they rise again,
[p]With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
[p]And push us from our stools: this is more strange
[p]Than such a murder is.
"
"My worthy lord,
[p]Your noble friends do lack you.
"
"I do forget.
[p]Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
[p]I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
[p]To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
[p]Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
[p]I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
[p]And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
[p]Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
[p]And all to all.
"
"Our duties, and the pledge.
"
"Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
[p]Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
[p]Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
[p]Which thou dost glare with!
"
"Think of this, good peers,
[p]But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
[p]Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
"
"What man dare, I dare:
[p]Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
[p]The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
[p]Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
[p]Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
[p]And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
[p]If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
[p]The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
[p]Unreal mockery, hence!
[p][GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes]
[p]Why, so: being gone,
[p]I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.
"
"You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
[p]With most admired disorder.
"
"Can such things be,
[p]And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
[p]Without our special wonder? You make me strange
[p]Even to the disposition that I owe,
[p]When now I think you can behold such sights,
[p]And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
[p]When mine is blanched with fear.
"
"What sights, my lord?
"
"I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
[p]Question enrages him. At once, good night:
[p]Stand not upon the order of your going,
[p]But go at once.
"
"Good night; and better health
[p]Attend his majesty!
"
"A kind good night to all!
"
"It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
[p]Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
[p]Augurs and understood relations have
[p]By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
[p]The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?
"
"Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
"
"How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
[p]At our great bidding?
"
"Did you send to him, sir?
"
"I hear it by the way; but I will send:
[p]There's not a one of them but in his house
[p]I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
[p]And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
[p]More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
[p]By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
[p]All causes shall give way: I am in blood
[p]Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
[p]Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
[p]Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
[p]Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.
"
"You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
"
"Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
[p]Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
[p]We are yet but young in deed.
"
"Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.
"
"Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
[p]Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
[p]To trade and traffic with Macbeth
[p]In riddles and affairs of death;
[p]And I, the mistress of your charms,
[p]The close contriver of all harms,
[p]Was never call'd to bear my part,
[p]Or show the glory of our art?
[p]And, which is worse, all you have done
[p]Hath been but for a wayward son,
[p]Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
[p]Loves for his own ends, not for you.
[p]But make amends now: get you gone,
[p]And at the pit of Acheron
[p]Meet me i' the morning: thither he
[p]Will come to know his destiny:
[p]Your vessels and your spells provide,
[p]Your charms and every thing beside.
[p]I am for the air; this night I'll spend
[p]Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
[p]Great business must be wrought ere noon:
[p]Upon the corner of the moon
[p]There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
[p]I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
[p]And that distill'd by magic sleights
[p]Shall raise such artificial sprites
[p]As by the strength of their illusion
[p]Shall draw him on to his confusion:
[p]He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
[p]He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
[p]And you all know, security
[p]Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
[p][Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,' &c]
[p]Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
[p]Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.
"
"Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
"
"My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
[p]Which can interpret further: only, I say,
[p]Things have been strangely borne. The
[p]gracious Duncan
[p]Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
[p]And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
[p]Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
[p]For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
[p]Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
[p]It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
[p]To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
[p]How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
[p]In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
[p]That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
[p]Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
[p]For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
[p]To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
[p]He has borne all things well: and I do think
[p]That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
[p]As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
[p]should find
[p]What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
[p]But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
[p]His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
[p]Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
[p]Where he bestows himself?
"
"The son of Duncan,
[p]From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
[p]Lives in the English court, and is received
[p]Of the most pious Edward with such grace
[p]That the malevolence of fortune nothing
[p]Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
[p]Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
[p]To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
[p]That, by the help of these--with Him above
[p]To ratify the work--we may again
[p]Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
[p]Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
[p]Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
[p]All which we pine for now: and this report
[p]Hath so exasperate the king that he
[p]Prepares for some attempt of war.
"
"Sent he to Macduff?
"
"He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
[p]The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
[p]And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
[p]That clogs me with this answer.'
"
"And that well might
[p]Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
[p]His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
[p]Fly to the court of England and unfold
[p]His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
[p]May soon return to this our suffering country
[p]Under a hand accursed!
"
"I'll send my prayers with him.

"Round about the cauldron go;
[p]In the poison'd entrails throw.
[p]Toad, that under cold stone
[p]Days and nights has thirty-one
[p]Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
[p]Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.
"
"Double, double toil and trouble;
[p]Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
"
"Fillet of a fenny snake,
[p]In the cauldron boil and bake;
[p]Eye of newt and toe of frog,
[p]Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
[p]Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
[p]Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
[p]For a charm of powerful trouble,
[p]Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
"
"Double, double toil and trouble;
[p]Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
"
"Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,

[p]Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
[p]Make the gruel thick and slab:
[p]Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
[p]For the ingredients of our cauldron.
"
"Double, double toil and trouble;
[p]Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
"
"Cool it with a baboon's blood,
[p]Then the charm is firm and good.
"
"O well done! I commend your pains;
[p]And every one shall share i' the gains;
[p]And now about the cauldron sing,
[p]Live elves and fairies in a ring,
[p]Enchanting all that you put in.
"
"By the pricking of my thumbs,

"How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
[p]What is't you do?
"
"A deed without a name.
"
"I conjure you, by that which you profess,
[p]Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
[p]Though you untie the winds and let them fight
[p]Against the churches; though the yesty waves
[p]Confound and swallow navigation up;
[p]Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
[p]Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
[p]Though palaces and pyramids do slope
[p]Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
[p]Of nature's germens tumble all together,
[p]Even till destruction sicken; answer me
[p]To what I ask you.
"
"Speak.
"
"Demand.
"
"We'll answer.
"
"Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
[p]Or from our masters?
"
"Call 'em; let me see 'em.

"
"Tell me, thou unknown power,--
"
"He knows thy thought:
[p]Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
"
"Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
[p]Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
"
"Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
[p]Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
[p]word more,--
"
"He will not be commanded: here's another,
[p]More potent than the first.
"
"Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
"
"Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.
"
"Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
[p]The power of man, for none of woman born
[p]Shall harm Macbeth.
"
"Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
[p]But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
[p]And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
[p]That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
[p]And sleep in spite of thunder.
[p][Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand]
[p]What is this
[p]That rises like the issue of a king,
[p]And wears upon his baby-brow the round
[p]And top of sovereignty?
"
"Listen, but speak not to't.
"
"Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
[p]Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
[p]Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
[p]Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
[p]Shall come against him.
"
"That will never be
[p]Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
[p]Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
[p]Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
[p]Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
[p]Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
[p]To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
[p]Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
[p]Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
[p]Reign in this kingdom?
"
"Seek to know no more.
"
"I will be satisfied: deny me this,
[p]And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
[p]Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
"
"Show!
"
"Show!
"
"Show!
"
"Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
[p]Come like shadows, so depart!
[p][A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in]
[p]his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following]
"
"Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
[p]Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
[p]Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
[p]A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
[p]Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
[p]What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
[p]Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
[p]And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
[p]Which shows me many more; and some I see
[p]That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
[p]Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
[p]For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
[p]And points at them for his.
[p][Apparitions vanish]
[p]What, is this so?
"
"Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
[p]Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
[p]Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
[p]And show the best of our delights:
[p]I'll charm the air to give a sound,
[p]While you perform your antic round:
[p]That this great king may kindly say,
[p]Our duties did his welcome pay.
"
"Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
[p]Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
[p]Come in, without there!
"
"What's your grace's will?
"
"Saw you the weird sisters?
"
"No, my lord.
"
"Came they not by you?
"
"No, indeed, my lord.
"
"Infected be the air whereon they ride;
[p]And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
[p]The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
"
"'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
[p]Macduff is fled to England.
"
"Fled to England!
"
"Ay, my good lord.
"
"Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
[p]The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
[p]Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
[p]The very firstlings of my heart shall be
[p]The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
[p]To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
[p]The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
[p]Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
[p]His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
[p]That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
[p]This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
[p]But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
[p]Come, bring me where they are.
"
"What had he done, to make him fly the land?
"
"You must have patience, madam.
"
"He had none:
[p]His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
[p]Our fears do make us traitors.
"
"You know not
[p]Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
"
"Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
[p]His mansion and his titles in a place
[p]From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
[p]He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
[p]The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
[p]Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
[p]All is the fear and nothing is the love;
[p]As little is the wisdom, where the flight
[p]So runs against all reason.
"
"My dearest coz,
[p]I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
[p]He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
[p]The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
[p]much further;
[p]But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
[p]And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
[p]From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
[p]But float upon a wild and violent sea
[p]Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
[p]Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
[p]Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
[p]To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
[p]Blessing upon you!
"
"Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
"
"I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
[p]It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
[p]I take my leave at once.
"
"Sirrah, your father's dead;
[p]And what will you do now? How will you live?
"
"As birds do, mother.
"
"What, with worms and flies?
"
"With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
"
"Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
[p]The pitfall nor the gin.
"
"Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
[p]My father is not dead, for all your saying.
"
"Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?
"
"Nay, how will you do for a husband?
"
"Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
"
"Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
"
"Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
[p]With wit enough for thee.
"
"Was my father a traitor, mother?
"
"Ay, that he was.
"
"What is a traitor?
"
"Why, one that swears and lies.
"
"And be all traitors that do so?
"
"Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.
"
"And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
"
"Every one.
"
"Who must hang them?
"
"Why, the honest men.
"
"Then the liars and swearers are fools,
[p]for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
[p]the honest men and hang up them.
"
"Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
[p]But how wilt thou do for a father?
"
"If he were dead, you'ld weep for
[p]him: if you would not, it were a good sign
[p]that I should quickly have a new father.
"
"Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
"
"Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
[p]Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
[p]I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
[p]If you will take a homely man's advice,
[p]Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
[p]To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
[p]To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
[p]Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
[p]I dare abide no longer.
"
"Whither should I fly?
[p]I have done no harm. But I remember now
[p]I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
[p]Is often laudable, to do good sometime
[p]Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
[p]Do I put up that womanly defence,
[p]To say I have done no harm?
[p][Enter Murderers]
[p]What are these faces?
"
"Where is your husband?
"
"I hope, in no place so unsanctified
[p]Where such as thou mayst find him.
"
"He's a traitor.
"
"Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!
"
"What, you egg!
[p][Stabbing him]
[p]Young fry of treachery!
"
"He has kill'd me, mother:
[p]Run away, I pray you!
[p][Dies]
[p][Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt]
[p]Murderers, following her]
"
"Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
[p]Weep our sad bosoms empty.
"
"Let us rather
[p]Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
[p]Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
[p]New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
[p]Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
[p]As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
[p]Like syllable of dolour.
"
"What I believe I'll wail,
[p]What know believe, and what I can redress,
[p]As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
[p]What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
[p]This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
[p]Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
[p]He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
[p]but something
[p]You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
[p]To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
[p]To appease an angry god.
"
"I am not treacherous.
"
"But Macbeth is.
[p]A good and virtuous nature may recoil
[p]In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
[p]your pardon;
[p]That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
[p]Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
[p]Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
[p]Yet grace must still look so.
"
"I have lost my hopes.
"
"Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
[p]Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
[p]Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
[p]Without leave-taking? I pray you,
[p]Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
[p]But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
[p]Whatever I shall think.
"
"Bleed, bleed, poor country!
[p]Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
[p]For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
[p]thy wrongs;
[p]The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
[p]I would not be the villain that thou think'st
[p]For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
[p]And the rich East to boot.
"
"Be not offended:
[p]I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
[p]I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
[p]It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
[p]Is added to her wounds: I think withal
[p]There would be hands uplifted in my right;
[p]And here from gracious England have I offer
[p]Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
[p]When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
[p]Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
[p]Shall have more vices than it had before,
[p]More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
[p]By him that shall succeed.
"
"What should he be?
"
"It is myself I mean: in whom I know
[p]All the particulars of vice so grafted
[p]That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
[p]Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
[p]Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
[p]With my confineless harms.
"
"Not in the legions
[p]Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
[p]In evils to top Macbeth.
"
"I grant him bloody,
[p]Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
[p]Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
[p]That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
[p]In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
[p]Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
[p]The cistern of my lust, and my desire
[p]All continent impediments would o'erbear
[p]That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
[p]Than such an one to reign.
"
"Boundless intemperance
[p]In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
[p]The untimely emptying of the happy throne
[p]And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
[p]To take upon you what is yours: you may
[p]Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
[p]And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
[p]We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
[p]That vulture in you, to devour so many
[p]As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
[p]Finding it so inclined.
"
"With this there grows
[p]In my most ill-composed affection such
[p]A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
[p]I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
[p]Desire his jewels and this other's house:
[p]And my more-having would be as a sauce
[p]To make me hunger more; that I should forge
[p]Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
[p]Destroying them for wealth.
"
"This avarice
[p]Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
[p]Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
[p]The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
[p]Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
[p]Of your mere own: all these are portable,
[p]With other graces weigh'd.
"
"But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
[p]As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
[p]Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
[p]Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
[p]I have no relish of them, but abound
[p]In the division of each several crime,
[p]Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
[p]Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
[p]Uproar the universal peace, confound
[p]All unity on earth.
"
"O Scotland, Scotland!
"
"If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
[p]I am as I have spoken.
"
"Fit to govern!
[p]No, not to live. O nation miserable,
[p]With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
[p]When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
[p]Since that the truest issue of thy throne
[p]By his own interdiction stands accursed,
[p]And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
[p]Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
[p]Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
[p]Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
[p]These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
[p]Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
[p]Thy hope ends here!
"
"Macduff, this noble passion,
[p]Child of integrity, hath from my soul
[p]Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
[p]To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
[p]By many of these trains hath sought to win me
[p]Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
[p]From over-credulous haste: but God above
[p]Deal between thee and me! for even now
[p]I put myself to thy direction, and
[p]Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
[p]The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
[p]For strangers to my nature. I am yet
[p]Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
[p]Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
[p]At no time broke my faith, would not betray
[p]The devil to his fellow and delight
[p]No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
[p]Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
[p]Is thine and my poor country's to command:
[p]Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
[p]Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
[p]Already at a point, was setting forth.
[p]Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
[p]Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?
"
"Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
[p]'Tis hard to reconcile.
"
"Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?
"
"Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
[p]That stay his cure: their malady convinces
[p]The great assay of art; but at his touch--
[p]Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
[p]They presently amend.
"
"I thank you, doctor.
"
"What's the disease he means?
"
"'Tis call'd the evil:
[p]A most miraculous work in this good king;
[p]Which often, since my here-remain in England,
[p]I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
[p]Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
[p]All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
[p]The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
[p]Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
[p]Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
[p]To the succeeding royalty he leaves
[p]The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
[p]He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
[p]And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
[p]That speak him full of grace.
"
"See, who comes here?
"
"My countryman; but yet I know him not.
"
"My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.
"
"I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
[p]The means that makes us strangers!
"
"Sir, amen.
"
"Stands Scotland where it did?
"
"Alas, poor country!
[p]Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
[p]Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
[p]But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
[p]Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
[p]Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
[p]A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
[p]Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
[p]Expire before the flowers in their caps,
[p]Dying or ere they sicken.
"
"O, relation
[p]Too nice, and yet too true!
"
"What's the newest grief?
"
"That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
[p]Each minute teems a new one.
"
"How does my wife?
"
"Why, well.
"
"And all my children?
"
"Well too.
"
"The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
"
"No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
"
"But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?
"
"When I came hither to transport the tidings,
[p]Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
[p]Of many worthy fellows that were out;
[p]Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
[p]For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
[p]Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
[p]Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
[p]To doff their dire distresses.
"
"Be't their comfort
[p]We are coming thither: gracious England hath
[p]Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
[p]An older and a better soldier none
[p]That Christendom gives out.
"
"Would I could answer
[p]This comfort with the like! But I have words
[p]That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
[p]Where hearing should not latch them.
"
"What concern they?
[p]The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
[p]Due to some single breast?
"
"No mind that's honest
[p]But in it shares some woe; though the main part
[p]Pertains to you alone.
"
"If it be mine,
[p]Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
"
"Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
[p]Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
[p]That ever yet they heard.
"
"Hum! I guess at it.
"
"Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
[p]Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
[p]Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
[p]To add the death of you.
"
"Merciful heaven!
[p]What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
[p]Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
[p]Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
"
"My children too?
"
"Wife, children, servants, all
[p]That could be found.
"
"And I must be from thence!
[p]My wife kill'd too?
"
"I have said.
"
"Be comforted:
[p]Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
[p]To cure this deadly grief.
"
"He has no children. All my pretty ones?
[p]Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
[p]What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
[p]At one fell swoop?
"
"Dispute it like a man.
"
"I shall do so;
[p]But I must also feel it as a man:
[p]I cannot but remember such things were,
[p]That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
[p]And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
[p]They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
[p]Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
[p]Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!
"
"Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
[p]Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
"
"O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
[p]And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
[p]Cut short all intermission; front to front
[p]Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
[p]Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
[p]Heaven forgive him too!
"
"This tune goes manly.
[p]Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
[p]Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
[p]Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
[p]Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
[p]The night is long that never finds the day.
"
"I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
[p]no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
"
"Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
[p]her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
[p]her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
[p]write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
[p]return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
"
"A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
[p]the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
[p]watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
[p]walking and other actual performances, what, at any
[p]time, have you heard her say?
"
"That, sir, which I will not report after her.
"
"You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
"
"Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
[p]confirm my speech.
[p][Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper]
[p]Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
[p]and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.
"
"How came she by that light?
"
"Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
[p]continually; 'tis her command.
"
"You see, her eyes are open.
"
"Ay, but their sense is shut.
"
"What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.
"
"It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
[p]washing her hands: I have known her continue in
[p]this a quarter of an hour.
"
"Yet here's a spot.
"
"Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
[p]her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
"
"Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
[p]then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
[p]lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
[p]fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
[p]account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
[p]to have had so much blood in him.
"
"Do you mark that?
"
"The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
[p]What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
[p]that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
[p]this starting.
"
"Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
"
"She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
[p]that: heaven knows what she has known.
"
"Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
[p]perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
[p]hand. Oh, oh, oh!
"
"What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
"
"I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
[p]dignity of the whole body.
"
"Well, well, well,--
"
"Pray God it be, sir.
"
"This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
[p]those which have walked in their sleep who have died
[p]holily in their beds.
"
"Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
[p]pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
[p]cannot come out on's grave.
"
"Even so?
"
"To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
[p]come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
[p]done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!
"
"Will she go now to bed?
"
"Directly.
"
"Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
[p]Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
[p]To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
[p]More needs she the divine than the physician.
[p]God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
[p]Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
[p]And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
[p]My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
[p]I think, but dare not speak.
"
"Good night, good doctor.
"
"The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
[p]His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
[p]Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
[p]Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
[p]Excite the mortified man.
"
"Near Birnam wood
[p]Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
"
"Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
"
"For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
[p]Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
[p]And many unrough youths that even now
[p]Protest their first of manhood.
"
"What does the tyrant?
"
"Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
[p]Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
[p]Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
[p]He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
[p]Within the belt of rule.
"
"Now does he feel
[p]His secret murders sticking on his hands;
[p]Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
[p]Those he commands move only in command,
[p]Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
[p]Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
[p]Upon a dwarfish thief.
"
"Who then shall blame
[p]His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
[p]When all that is within him does condemn
[p]Itself for being there?
"
"Well, march we on,
[p]To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
[p]Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
[p]And with him pour we in our country's purge
[p]Each drop of us.
"
"Or so much as it needs,
[p]To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
[p]Make we our march towards Birnam.
"
"Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
[p]Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
[p]I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
[p]Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
[p]All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
[p]'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
[p]Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
[p]false thanes,
[p]And mingle with the English epicures:
[p]The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
[p]Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
[p][Enter a Servant]
[p]The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
[p]Where got'st thou that goose look?
"
"There is ten thousand--
"
"Geese, villain!
"
"Soldiers, sir.
"
"Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
[p]Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
[p]Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
[p]Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?
"
"The English force, so please you.
"
"Take thy face hence.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p]Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
[p]When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
[p]Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
[p]I have lived long enough: my way of life
[p]Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
[p]And that which should accompany old age,
[p]As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
[p]I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
[p]Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
[p]Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!
"
"What is your gracious pleasure?
"
"What news more?
"
"All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
"
"I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
[p]Give me my armour.
"
"'Tis not needed yet.
"
"I'll put it on.
[p]Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
[p]Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
[p]How does your patient, doctor?
"
"Not so sick, my lord,
[p]As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
[p]That keep her from her rest.
"
"Cure her of that.
[p]Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
[p]Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
[p]Raze out the written troubles of the brain
[p]And with some sweet oblivious antidote
[p]Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
[p]Which weighs upon the heart?
"
"Therein the patient
[p]Must minister to himself.
"
"Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
[p]Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
[p]Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
[p]Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
[p]The water of my land, find her disease,
[p]And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
[p]I would applaud thee to the very echo,
[p]That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
[p]What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
[p]Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?
"
"Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
[p]Makes us hear something.
"
"Bring it after me.
[p]I will not be afraid of death and bane,
[p]Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.
"
"[Aside] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
[p]Profit again should hardly draw me here.
"
"Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
[p]That chambers will be safe.
"
"We doubt it nothing.
"
"What wood is this before us?
"
"The wood of Birnam.
"
"Let every soldier hew him down a bough
[p]And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
[p]The numbers of our host and make discovery
[p]Err in report of us.
"
"It shall be done.
"
"We learn no other but the confident tyrant
[p]Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
[p]Our setting down before 't.
"
"'Tis his main hope:
[p]For where there is advantage to be given,
[p]Both more and less have given him the revolt,
[p]And none serve with him but constrained things
[p]Whose hearts are absent too.
"
"Let our just censures
[p]Attend the true event, and put we on
[p]Industrious soldiership.
"
"The time approaches
[p]That will with due decision make us know
[p]What we shall say we have and what we owe.
[p]Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
[p]But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
[p]Towards which advance the war.
"
"Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
[p]The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
[p]Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
[p]Till famine and the ague eat them up:
[p]Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
[p]We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
[p]And beat them backward home.
[p][A cry of women within]
[p]What is that noise?
"
"It is the cry of women, my good lord.
"
"I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
[p]The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
[p]To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
[p]Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
[p]As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
[p]Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
[p]Cannot once start me.
[p][Re-enter SEYTON]
[p]Wherefore was that cry?
"
"The queen, my lord, is dead.
"
"She should have died hereafter;
[p]There would have been a time for such a word.
[p]To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
[p]Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
[p]To the last syllable of recorded time,
[p]And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
[p]The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
[p]Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
[p]That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
[p]And then is heard no more: it is a tale
[p]Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
[p]Signifying nothing.
[p][Enter a Messenger]
[p]Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
"
"Gracious my lord,
[p]I should report that which I say I saw,
[p]But know not how to do it.
"
"Well, say, sir.
"
"As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
[p]I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
[p]The wood began to move.
"
"Liar and slave!
"
"Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
[p]Within this three mile may you see it coming;
[p]I say, a moving grove.
"
"If thou speak'st false,
[p]Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
[p]Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
[p]I care not if thou dost for me as much.
[p]I pull in resolution, and begin
[p]To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
[p]That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
[p]Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
[p]Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
[p]If this which he avouches does appear,
[p]There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
[p]I gin to be aweary of the sun,
[p]And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
[p]Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
[p]At least we'll die with harness on our back.
"
"Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
[p]And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
[p]Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
[p]Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
[p]Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
[p]According to our order.
"
"Fare you well.
[p]Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
[p]Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.
"
"Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
[p]Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
"
"They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
[p]But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
[p]That was not born of woman? Such a one
[p]Am I to fear, or none.
"
"What is thy name?
"
"Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
"
"No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
[p]Than any is in hell.
"
"My name's Macbeth.
"
"The devil himself could not pronounce a title
[p]More hateful to mine ear.
"
"No, nor more fearful.
"
"Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
[p]I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
"
"Thou wast born of woman
[p]But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
[p]Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
"
"That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
[p]If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
[p]My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
[p]I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
[p]Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
[p]Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
[p]I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
[p]By this great clatter, one of greatest note
[p]Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
[p]And more I beg not.
"
"This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:
[p]The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
[p]The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
[p]The day almost itself professes yours,
[p]And little is to do.
"
"We have met with foes
[p]That strike beside us.
"
"Enter, sir, the castle.
"
"Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
[p]On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
[p]Do better upon them.
"
"Turn, hell-hound, turn!
"
"Of all men else I have avoided thee:
[p]But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
[p]With blood of thine already.
"
"I have no words:
[p]My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
[p]Than terms can give thee out!
"
"Thou losest labour:
[p]As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
[p]With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
[p]Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
[p]I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
[p]To one of woman born.
"
"Despair thy charm;
[p]And let the angel whom thou still hast served
[p]Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
[p]Untimely ripp'd.
"
"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
[p]For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
[p]And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
[p]That palter with us in a double sense;
[p]That keep the word of promise to our ear,
[p]And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
"
"Then yield thee, coward,
[p]And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
[p]We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
[p]Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
[p]'Here may you see the tyrant.'
"
"I will not yield,
[p]To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
[p]And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
[p]Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
[p]And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
[p]Yet I will try the last. Before my body
[p]I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
[p]And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
[p][Exeunt, fighting. Alarums]
[p][Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours,]
[p]MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers]
"
"I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
"
"Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
[p]So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
"
"Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
"
"Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
[p]He only lived but till he was a man;
[p]The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
[p]In the unshrinking station where he fought,
[p]But like a man he died.
"
"Then he is dead?
"
"Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
[p]Must not be measured by his worth, for then
[p]It hath no end.
"
"Had he his hurts before?
"
"Ay, on the front.
"
"Why then, God's soldier be he!
[p]Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
[p]I would not wish them to a fairer death:
[p]And so, his knell is knoll'd.
"
"He's worth more sorrow,
[p]And that I'll spend for him.
"
"He's worth no more
[p]They say he parted well, and paid his score:
[p]And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.
"
"Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
[p]The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
[p]I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
[p]That speak my salutation in their minds;
[p]Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
[p]Hail, King of Scotland!
"
"Hail, King of Scotland!
"
"We shall not spend a large expense of time
[p]Before we reckon with your several loves,
[p]And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
[p]Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
[p]In such an honour named. What's more to do,
[p]Which would be planted newly with the time,
[p]As calling home our exiled friends abroad
[p]That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
[p]Producing forth the cruel ministers
[p]Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
[p]Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
[p]Took off her life; this, and what needful else
[p]That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
[p]We will perform in measure, time and place:
[p]So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
[p]Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
"
"Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
[p]That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
[p]As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
"
"'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
[p]If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.
"
"Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
"
"Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
[p]In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
[p]Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
[p]I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
[p]But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
[p]Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
[p]Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
[p]And, in conclusion,
[p]Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
[p]'I have already chose my officer.'
[p]And what was he?
[p]Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
[p]One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
[p]A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
[p]That never set a squadron in the field,
[p]Nor the division of a battle knows
[p]More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
[p]Wherein the toged consuls can propose
[p]As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
[p]Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
[p]And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
[p]At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
[p]Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
[p]By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
[p]He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
[p]And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.
"
"By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
"
"Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
[p]Preferment goes by letter and affection,
[p]And not by old gradation, where each second
[p]Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
[p]Whether I in any just term am affined
[p]To love the Moor.
"
"I would not follow him then.
"
"O, sir, content you;
[p]I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
[p]We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
[p]Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
[p]Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
[p]That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
[p]Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
[p]For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
[p]Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
[p]Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
[p]Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
[p]And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
[p]Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
[p]their coats
[p]Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
[p]And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
[p]It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
[p]Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
[p]In following him, I follow but myself;
[p]Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
[p]But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
[p]For when my outward action doth demonstrate
[p]The native act and figure of my heart
[p]In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
[p]But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
[p]For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
"
"What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
[p]If he can carry't thus!
"
"Call up her father,
[p]Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
[p]Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
[p]And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
[p]Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
[p]Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
[p]As it may lose some colour.
"
"Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
"
"Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
[p]As when, by night and negligence, the fire
[p]Is spied in populous cities.
"
"What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
"
"Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
[p]Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
[p]Thieves! thieves!
"
"What is the reason of this terrible summons?
[p]What is the matter there?
"
"Signior, is all your family within?
"
"Are your doors lock'd?
"
"Why, wherefore ask you this?
"
"'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
[p]your gown;
[p]Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
[p]Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
[p]Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
[p]Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
[p]Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
[p]Arise, I say.
"
"What, have you lost your wits?
"
"Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
"
"Not I. what are you?
"
"My name is Roderigo.
"
"The worser welcome:
[p]I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
[p]In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
[p]My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
[p]Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
[p]Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
[p]To start my quiet.
"
"Sir, sir, sir,--
"
"But thou must needs be sure
[p]My spirit and my place have in them power
[p]To make this bitter to thee.
"
"Patience, good sir.
"
"What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
[p]My house is not a grange.
"
"Most grave Brabantio,
[p]In simple and pure soul I come to you.
"
"'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
[p]serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
[p]do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
[p]have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
[p]you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
[p]coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
"
"What profane wretch art thou?
"
"I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
[p]and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
"
"Thou art a villain.
"
"You are--a senator.
"
"This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
"
"Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
[p]If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
[p]As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
[p]At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
[p]Transported, with no worse nor better guard
[p]But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
[p]To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
[p]If this be known to you and your allowance,
[p]We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
[p]But if you know not this, my manners tell me
[p]We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
[p]That, from the sense of all civility,
[p]I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
[p]Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
[p]I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
[p]Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
[p]In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
[p]Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
[p]If she be in her chamber or your house,
[p]Let loose on me the justice of the state
[p]For thus deluding you.
"
"Strike on the tinder, ho!
[p]Give me a taper! call up all my people!
[p]This accident is not unlike my dream:
[p]Belief of it oppresses me already.
[p]Light, I say! light!
"
"Farewell; for I must leave you:
[p]It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
[p]To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
[p]Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
[p]However this may gall him with some cheque,
[p]Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
[p]With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
[p]Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
[p]Another of his fathom they have none,
[p]To lead their business: in which regard,
[p]Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
[p]Yet, for necessity of present life,
[p]I must show out a flag and sign of love,
[p]Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
[p]Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
[p]And there will I be with him. So, farewell.
"
"It is too true an evil: gone she is;
[p]And what's to come of my despised time
[p]Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
[p]Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
[p]With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
[p]How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
[p]Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
[p]Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
"
"Truly, I think they are.
"
"O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
[p]Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
[p]By what you see them act. Is there not charms
[p]By which the property of youth and maidhood
[p]May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
[p]Of some such thing?
"
"Yes, sir, I have indeed.
"
"Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
[p]Some one way, some another. Do you know
[p]Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
"
"I think I can discover him, if you please,
[p]To get good guard and go along with me.
"
"Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
[p]I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
[p]And raise some special officers of night.
[p]On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.
"
"Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
[p]Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
[p]To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
[p]Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
[p]I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
"
"'Tis better as it is.
"
"Nay, but he prated,
[p]And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
[p]Against your honour
[p]That, with the little godliness I have,
[p]I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
[p]Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
[p]That the magnifico is much beloved,
[p]And hath in his effect a voice potential
[p]As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
[p]Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
[p]The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
[p]Will give him cable.
"
"Let him do his spite:
[p]My services which I have done the signiory
[p]Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--
[p]Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
[p]I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being
[p]From men of royal siege, and my demerits
[p]May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
[p]As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
[p]But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
[p]I would not my unhoused free condition
[p]Put into circumscription and confine
[p]For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?
"
"Those are the raised father and his friends:
[p]You were best go in.
"
"Not I. I must be found:
[p]My parts, my title and my perfect soul
[p]Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
"
"By Janus, I think no.
"
"The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
[p]The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
[p]What is the news?
"
"The duke does greet you, general,
[p]And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
[p]Even on the instant.
"
"What is the matter, think you?
"
"Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
[p]It is a business of some heat: the galleys
[p]Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
[p]This very night at one another's heels,
[p]And many of the consuls, raised and met,
[p]Are at the duke's already: you have been
[p]hotly call'd for;
[p]When, being not at your lodging to be found,
[p]The senate hath sent about three several guests
[p]To search you out.
"
"'Tis well I am found by you.
[p]I will but spend a word here in the house,
[p]And go with you.
"
"Ancient, what makes he here?
"
"'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
[p]If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.
"
"I do not understand.
"
"He's married.
"
"To who?
"
"Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?
"
"Have with you.
"
"Here comes another troop to seek for you.
"
"It is Brabantio. General, be advised;
[p]He comes to bad intent.
"
"Holla! stand there!
"
"Signior, it is the Moor.
"
"Down with him, thief!
"
"You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.
"
"Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
[p]Good signior, you shall more command with years
[p]Than with your weapons.
"
"O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
[p]Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
[p]For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
[p]If she in chains of magic were not bound,
[p]Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
[p]So opposite to marriage that she shunned
[p]The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
[p]Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
[p]Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
[p]Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
[p]Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
[p]That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
[p]Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
[p]That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
[p]'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
[p]I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
[p]For an abuser of the world, a practiser
[p]Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
[p]Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
[p]Subdue him at his peril.
"
"Hold your hands,
[p]Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
[p]Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
[p]Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
[p]To answer this your charge?
"
"To prison, till fit time
[p]Of law and course of direct session
[p]Call thee to answer.
"
"What if I do obey?
[p]How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
[p]Whose messengers are here about my side,
[p]Upon some present business of the state
[p]To bring me to him?
"
"'Tis true, most worthy signior;
[p]The duke's in council and your noble self,
[p]I am sure, is sent for.
"
"How! the duke in council!
[p]In this time of the night! Bring him away:
[p]Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
[p]Or any of my brothers of the state,
[p]Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
[p]For if such actions may have passage free,
[p]Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
"
"There is no composition in these news
[p]That gives them credit.
"
"Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
[p]My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
"
"And mine, a hundred and forty.
"
"And mine, two hundred:
[p]But though they jump not on a just account,--
[p]As in these cases, where the aim reports,
[p]'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm
[p]A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
"
"Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
[p]I do not so secure me in the error,
[p]But the main article I do approve
[p]In fearful sense.
"
"[Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!
"
"A messenger from the galleys.
"
"Now, what's the business?
"
"The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
[p]So was I bid report here to the state
[p]By Signior Angelo.
"
"How say you by this change?
"
"This cannot be,
[p]By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,
[p]To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
[p]The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
[p]And let ourselves again but understand,
[p]That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
[p]So may he with more facile question bear it,
[p]For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
[p]But altogether lacks the abilities
[p]That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
[p]We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
[p]To leave that latest which concerns him first,
[p]Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
[p]To wake and wage a danger profitless.
"
"Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
"
"Here is more news.
"
"The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
[p]Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,
[p]Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
"
"Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
"
"Of thirty sail: and now they do restem
[p]Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
[p]Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
[p]Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
[p]With his free duty recommends you thus,
[p]And prays you to believe him.
"
"'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
[p]Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
"
"He's now in Florence.
"
"Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.
"
"Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
"
"Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
[p]Against the general enemy Ottoman.
[p][To BRABANTIO]
[p]I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
[p]We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.
"
"So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
[p]Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
[p]Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
[p]Take hold on me, for my particular grief
[p]Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
[p]That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
[p]And it is still itself.
"
"Why, what's the matter?
"
"My daughter! O, my daughter!
"
"[with Senator] Dead?
"
"Ay, to me;
[p]She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
[p]By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
[p]For nature so preposterously to err,
[p]Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
[p]Sans witchcraft could not.
"
"Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
[p]Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
[p]And you of her, the bloody book of law
[p]You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
[p]After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
[p]Stood in your action.
"
"Humbly I thank your grace.
[p]Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
[p]Your special mandate for the state-affairs
[p]Hath hither brought.
"
"[with Senator] We are very sorry for't.
"
"[To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to this?
"
"Nothing, but this is so.
"
"Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
[p]My very noble and approved good masters,
[p]That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
[p]It is most true; true, I have married her:
[p]The very head and front of my offending
[p]Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
[p]And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
[p]For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
[p]Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
[p]Their dearest action in the tented field,
[p]And little of this great world can I speak,
[p]More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
[p]And therefore little shall I grace my cause
[p]In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
[p]I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
[p]Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
[p]What conjuration and what mighty magic,
[p]For such proceeding I am charged withal,
[p]I won his daughter.
"
"A maiden never bold;
[p]Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
[p]Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
[p]Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
[p]To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
[p]It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
[p]That will confess perfection so could err
[p]Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
[p]To find out practises of cunning hell,
[p]Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
[p]That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
[p]Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
[p]He wrought upon her.
"
"To vouch this, is no proof,
[p]Without more wider and more overt test
[p]Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
[p]Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
"
"But, Othello, speak:
[p]Did you by indirect and forced courses
[p]Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
[p]Or came it by request and such fair question
[p]As soul to soul affordeth?
"
"I do beseech you,
[p]Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
[p]And let her speak of me before her father:
[p]If you do find me foul in her report,
[p]The trust, the office I do hold of you,
[p]Not only take away, but let your sentence
[p]Even fall upon my life.
"
"Fetch Desdemona hither.
"
"Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.
[p][Exeunt IAGO and Attendants]
[p]And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
[p]I do confess the vices of my blood,
[p]So justly to your grave ears I'll present
[p]How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
[p]And she in mine.
"
"Say it, Othello.
"
"Her father loved me; oft invited me;
[p]Still question'd me the story of my life,
[p]From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
[p]That I have passed.
[p]I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
[p]To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
[p]Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
[p]Of moving accidents by flood and field
[p]Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
[p]Of being taken by the insolent foe
[p]And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
[p]And portance in my travels' history:
[p]Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
[p]Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
[p]It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
[p]And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
[p]The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
[p]Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
[p]Would Desdemona seriously incline:
[p]But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
[p]Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
[p]She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
[p]Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
[p]Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
[p]To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
[p]That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
[p]Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
[p]But not intentively: I did consent,
[p]And often did beguile her of her tears,
[p]When I did speak of some distressful stroke
[p]That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
[p]She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
[p]She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
[p]'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
[p]She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
[p]That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
[p]And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
[p]I should but teach him how to tell my story.
[p]And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
[p]She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
[p]And I loved her that she did pity them.
[p]This only is the witchcraft I have used:
[p]Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
"
"I think this tale would win my daughter too.
[p]Good Brabantio,
[p]Take up this mangled matter at the best:
[p]Men do their broken weapons rather use
[p]Than their bare hands.
"
"I pray you, hear her speak:
[p]If she confess that she was half the wooer,
[p]Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
[p]Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
[p]Do you perceive in all this noble company
[p]Where most you owe obedience?
"
"My noble father,
[p]I do perceive here a divided duty:
[p]To you I am bound for life and education;
[p]My life and education both do learn me
[p]How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
[p]I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
[p]And so much duty as my mother show'd
[p]To you, preferring you before her father,
[p]So much I challenge that I may profess
[p]Due to the Moor my lord.
"
"God be wi' you! I have done.
[p]Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
[p]I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
[p]Come hither, Moor:
[p]I here do give thee that with all my heart
[p]Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
[p]I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
[p]I am glad at soul I have no other child:
[p]For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
[p]To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.
"
"Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
[p]Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
[p]Into your favour.
[p]When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
[p]By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
[p]To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
[p]Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
[p]What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
[p]Patience her injury a mockery makes.
[p]The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
[p]He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
"
"So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
[p]We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
[p]He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
[p]But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
[p]But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
[p]That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
[p]These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
[p]Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
[p]But words are words; I never yet did hear
[p]That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
[p]I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
"
"The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
[p]Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
[p]known to you; and though we have there a substitute
[p]of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
[p]sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
[p]voice on you: you must therefore be content to
[p]slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
[p]more stubborn and boisterous expedition.
"
"The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
[p]Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
[p]My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
[p]A natural and prompt alacrity
[p]I find in hardness, and do undertake
[p]These present wars against the Ottomites.
[p]Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
[p]I crave fit disposition for my wife.
[p]Due reference of place and exhibition,
[p]With such accommodation and besort
[p]As levels with her breeding.
"
"If you please,
[p]Be't at her father's.
"
"I'll not have it so.
"
"Nor I.
"
"Nor I; I would not there reside,
[p]To put my father in impatient thoughts
[p]By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
[p]To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
[p]And let me find a charter in your voice,
[p]To assist my simpleness.
"
"What would You, Desdemona?
"
"That I did love the Moor to live with him,
[p]My downright violence and storm of fortunes
[p]May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
[p]Even to the very quality of my lord:
[p]I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
[p]And to his honour and his valiant parts
[p]Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
[p]So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
[p]A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
[p]The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
[p]And I a heavy interim shall support
[p]By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
"
"Let her have your voices.
[p]Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
[p]To please the palate of my appetite,
[p]Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
[p]In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.
[p]But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
[p]And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
[p]I will your serious and great business scant
[p]For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
[p]Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
[p]My speculative and officed instruments,
[p]That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
[p]Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
[p]And all indign and base adversities
[p]Make head against my estimation!
"
"Be it as you shall privately determine,
[p]Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
[p]And speed must answer it.
"
"You must away to-night.
"
"With all my heart.
"
"At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
[p]Othello, leave some officer behind,
[p]And he shall our commission bring to you;
[p]With such things else of quality and respect
[p]As doth import you.
"
"So please your grace, my ancient;
[p]A man he is of honest and trust:
[p]To his conveyance I assign my wife,
[p]With what else needful your good grace shall think
[p]To be sent after me.
"
"Let it be so.
[p]Good night to every one.
[p][To BRABANTIO]
[p]And, noble signior,
[p]If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
[p]Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
"
"Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
"
"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
[p]She has deceived her father, and may thee.
"
"My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
[p]My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
[p]I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
[p]And bring them after in the best advantage.
[p]Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
[p]Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
[p]To spend with thee: we must obey the time.
"
"Iago,--
"
"What say'st thou, noble heart?
"
"What will I do, thinkest thou?
"
"Why, go to bed, and sleep.
"
"I will incontinently drown myself.
"
"If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,
[p]thou silly gentleman!
"
"It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
[p]then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
"
"O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
[p]times seven years; and since I could distinguish
[p]betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
[p]that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
[p]would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
[p]would change my humanity with a baboon.
"
"What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
[p]fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
"
"Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
[p]or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
[p]our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
[p]nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
[p]thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
[p]distract it with many, either to have it sterile
[p]with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
[p]power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
[p]wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
[p]scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
[p]blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
[p]to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
[p]reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
[p]stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
[p]you call love to be a sect or scion.
"
"It cannot be.
"
"It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
[p]the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
[p]cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
[p]friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
[p]cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
[p]better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
[p]purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
[p]an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
[p]cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
[p]love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he
[p]his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
[p]shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
[p]money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
[p]their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
[p]that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
[p]to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
[p]change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
[p]she will find the error of her choice: she must
[p]have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
[p]purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
[p]more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
[p]thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
[p]an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
[p]too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
[p]shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
[p]drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
[p]thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
[p]to be drowned and go without her.
"
"Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
[p]the issue?
"
"Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told
[p]thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
[p]hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
[p]less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
[p]against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
[p]thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
[p]events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
[p]Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
[p]of this to-morrow. Adieu.
"
"Where shall we meet i' the morning?
"
"At my lodging.
"
"I'll be with thee betimes.
"
"Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
"
"What say you?
"
"No more of drowning, do you hear?
"
"I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.
"
"Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
[p]For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
[p]If I would time expend with such a snipe.
[p]But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
[p]And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
[p]He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
[p]But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
[p]Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
[p]The better shall my purpose work on him.
[p]Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
[p]To get his place and to plume up my will
[p]In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--
[p]After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
[p]That he is too familiar with his wife.
[p]He hath a person and a smooth dispose
[p]To be suspected, framed to make women false.
[p]The Moor is of a free and open nature,
[p]That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
[p]And will as tenderly be led by the nose
[p]As asses are.
[p]I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
[p]Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.
"
"What from the cape can you discern at sea?
"
"Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
[p]I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
[p]Descry a sail.
"
"Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
[p]A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
[p]If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
[p]What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
[p]Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
"
"A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
[p]For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
[p]The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
[p]The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
[p]seems to cast water on the burning bear,
[p]And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
[p]I never did like molestation view
[p]On the enchafed flood.
"
"If that the Turkish fleet
[p]Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:
[p]It is impossible they bear it out.
"
"News, lads! our wars are done.
[p]The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
[p]That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
[p]Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
[p]On most part of their fleet.
"
"How! is this true?
"
"The ship is here put in,
[p]A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
[p]Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
[p]Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,
[p]And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
"
"I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
"
"But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
[p]Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
[p]And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
[p]With foul and violent tempest.
"
"Pray heavens he be;
[p]For I have served him, and the man commands
[p]Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
[p]As well to see the vessel that's come in
[p]As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
[p]Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
[p]An indistinct regard.
"
"Come, let's do so:
[p]For every minute is expectancy
[p]Of more arrivance.
"
"Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
[p]That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
[p]Give him defence against the elements,
[p]For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.
"
"Is he well shipp'd?
"
"His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
[p]Of very expert and approved allowance;
[p]Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
[p]Stand in bold cure.
"
"What noise?
"
"The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
[p]Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'
"
"My hopes do shape him for the governor.
"
"They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
[p]Our friends at least.
"
"I pray you, sir, go forth,
[p]And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.
"
"I shall.
"
"But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
"
"Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
[p]That paragons description and wild fame;
[p]One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
[p]And in the essential vesture of creation
[p]Does tire the ingener.
[p][Re-enter second Gentleman]
[p]How now! who has put in?
"
"'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
"
"Has had most favourable and happy speed:
[p]Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
[p]The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--
[p]Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
[p]As having sense of beauty, do omit
[p]Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
[p]The divine Desdemona.
"
"What is she?
"
"She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
[p]Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
[p]Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
[p]A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
[p]And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
[p]That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
[p]Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
[p]Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
[p]And bring all Cyprus comfort!
[p][Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants]
[p]O, behold,
[p]The riches of the ship is come on shore!
[p]Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
[p]Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
[p]Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
[p]Enwheel thee round!
"
"I thank you, valiant Cassio.
[p]What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
"
"He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
[p]But that he's well and will be shortly here.
"
"O, but I fear--How lost you company?
"
"The great contention of the sea and skies
[p]Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.
"
"They give their greeting to the citadel;
[p]This likewise is a friend.
"
"See for the news.
[p][Exit Gentleman]
[p]Good ancient, you are welcome.
[p][To EMILIA]
[p]Welcome, mistress.
[p]Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
[p]That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
[p]That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
"
"Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
[p]As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
[p]You'll have enough.
"
"Alas, she has no speech.
"
"In faith, too much;
[p]I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
[p]Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
[p]She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
[p]And chides with thinking.
"
"You have little cause to say so.
"
"Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
[p]Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
[p]Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,
[p]Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.
"
"O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
"
"Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
[p]You rise to play and go to bed to work.
"
"You shall not write my praise.
"
"No, let me not.
"
"What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
[p]praise me?
"
"O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
[p]For I am nothing, if not critical.
"
"Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?
"
"Ay, madam.
"
"I am not merry; but I do beguile
[p]The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
[p]Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
"
"I am about it; but indeed my invention
[p]Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
[p]It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,
[p]And thus she is deliver'd.
[p]If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
[p]The one's for use, the other useth it.
"
"Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
"
"If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
[p]She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
"
"Worse and worse.
"
"How if fair and foolish?
"
"She never yet was foolish that was fair;
[p]For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
"
"These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
[p]the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
[p]her that's foul and foolish?
"
"There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
[p]But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
"
"O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
[p]But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
[p]woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
[p]merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
"
"She that was ever fair and never proud,
[p]Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
[p]Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
[p]Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
[p]She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
[p]Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
[p]She that in wisdom never was so frail
[p]To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
[p]She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
[p]See suitors following and not look behind,
[p]She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
"
"To do what?
"
"To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
"
"O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
[p]of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
[p]you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
[p]counsellor?
"
"He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
[p]the soldier than in the scholar.
"
"[Aside] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,
[p]whisper: with as little a web as this will I
[p]ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
[p]her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
[p]You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
[p]these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
[p]been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
[p]oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
[p]sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
[p]courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
[p]to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!
[p][Trumpet within]
[p]The Moor! I know his trumpet.
"
"'Tis truly so.
"
"Let's meet him and receive him.
"
"Lo, where he comes!
"
"O my fair warrior!
"
"My dear Othello!
"
"It gives me wonder great as my content
[p]To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
[p]If after every tempest come such calms,
[p]May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
[p]And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
[p]Olympus-high and duck again as low
[p]As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
[p]'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
[p]My soul hath her content so absolute
[p]That not another comfort like to this
[p]Succeeds in unknown fate.
"
"The heavens forbid
[p]But that our loves and comforts should increase,
[p]Even as our days do grow!
"
"Amen to that, sweet powers!
[p]I cannot speak enough of this content;
[p]It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
[p]And this, and this, the greatest discords be
[p][Kissing her]
[p]That e'er our hearts shall make!
"
"[Aside] O, you are well tuned now!
[p]But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
[p]As honest as I am.
"
"Come, let us to the castle.
[p]News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
[p]are drown'd.
[p]How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
[p]Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
[p]I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
[p]I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
[p]In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
[p]Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
[p]Bring thou the master to the citadel;
[p]He is a good one, and his worthiness
[p]Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
[p]Once more, well met at Cyprus.
"
"Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
[p]hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base
[p]men being in love have then a nobility in their
[p]natures more than is native to them--list me. The
[p]lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
[p]guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is
[p]directly in love with him.
"
"With him! why, 'tis not possible.
"
"Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
[p]Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
[p]but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
[p]and will she love him still for prating? let not
[p]thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
[p]and what delight shall she have to look on the
[p]devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
[p]sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
[p]give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
[p]sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
[p]the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
[p]required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
[p]find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
[p]disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
[p]instruct her in it and compel her to some second
[p]choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most
[p]pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
[p]eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
[p]does? a knave very voluble; no further
[p]conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
[p]civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
[p]of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
[p]none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
[p]finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
[p]counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
[p]present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
[p]knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
[p]requisites in him that folly and green minds look
[p]after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
[p]hath found him already.
"
"I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
[p]most blessed condition.
"
"Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
[p]grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
[p]have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
[p]not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
[p]not mark that?
"
"Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
"
"Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
[p]to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
[p]so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
[p]together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
[p]mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
[p]the master and main exercise, the incorporate
[p]conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
[p]have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
[p]for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
[p]you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
[p]some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
[p]too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
[p]other course you please, which the time shall more
[p]favourably minister.
"
"Well.
"
"Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
[p]may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
[p]even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
[p]mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
[p]taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
[p]shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
[p]the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
[p]impediment most profitably removed, without the
[p]which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
"
"I will do this, if I can bring it to any
[p]opportunity.
"
"I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
[p]I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
"
"Adieu.
"
"That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
[p]That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
[p]The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
[p]Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
[p]And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
[p]A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
[p]Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
[p]I stand accountant for as great a sin,
[p]But partly led to diet my revenge,
[p]For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
[p]Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
[p]Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
[p]And nothing can or shall content my soul
[p]Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
[p]Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
[p]At least into a jealousy so strong
[p]That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
[p]If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
[p]For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
[p]I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
[p]Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
[p]For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
[p]Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
[p]For making him egregiously an ass
[p]And practising upon his peace and quiet
[p]Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
[p]Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.
"
"It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
[p]general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,
[p]importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,
[p]every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,
[p]some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and
[p]revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these
[p]beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
[p]nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be
[p]proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full
[p]liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
[p]till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the
[p]isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
"
"Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
[p]Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,
[p]Not to outsport discretion.
"
"Iago hath direction what to do;
[p]But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
[p]Will I look to't.
"
"Iago is most honest.
[p]Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
[p]Let me have speech with you.
[p][To DESDEMONA]
[p]Come, my dear love,
[p]The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
[p]That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
[p]Good night.
"
"Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
"
"Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the
[p]clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
[p]of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
[p]he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
[p]she is sport for Jove.
"
"She's a most exquisite lady.
"
"And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.
"
"Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
"
"What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
[p]provocation.
"
"An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
"
"And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
"
"She is indeed perfection.
"
"Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I
[p]have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
[p]of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
[p]the health of black Othello.
"
"Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
[p]unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
[p]courtesy would invent some other custom of
[p]entertainment.
"
"O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for
[p]you.
"
"I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was
[p]craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
[p]it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
[p]and dare not task my weakness with any more.
"
"What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants
[p]desire it.
"
"Where are they?
"
"Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
"
"I'll do't; but it dislikes me.
"
"If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
[p]With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
[p]He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
[p]As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
[p]Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
[p]To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
[p]Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
[p]Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
[p]That hold their honours in a wary distance,
[p]The very elements of this warlike isle,
[p]Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
[p]And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
[p]Am I to put our Cassio in some action
[p]That may offend the isle.--But here they come:
[p]If consequence do but approve my dream,
[p]My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
"
"'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
"
"Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am
[p]a soldier.
"
"Some wine, ho!
[p][Sings]
[p]And let me the canakin clink, clink;
[p]And let me the canakin clink
[p]A soldier's a man;
[p]A life's but a span;
[p]Why, then, let a soldier drink.
[p]Some wine, boys!
"
"'Fore God, an excellent song.
"
"I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are
[p]most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
[p]your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing
[p]to your English.
"
"Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
"
"Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead
[p]drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
[p]gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
[p]can be filled.
"
"To the health of our general!
"
"I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.
"
"O sweet England!
[p]King Stephen was a worthy peer,
[p]His breeches cost him but a crown;
[p]He held them sixpence all too dear,
[p]With that he call'd the tailor lown.
[p]He was a wight of high renown,
[p]And thou art but of low degree:
[p]'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
[p]Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
[p]Some wine, ho!
"
"Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
"
"Will you hear't again?
"
"No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
[p]does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
[p]be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
"
"It's true, good lieutenant.
"
"For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor
[p]any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.
"
"And so do I too, lieutenant.
"
"Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
[p]lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's
[p]have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive
[p]us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
[p]Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
[p]ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
[p]I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
[p]speak well enough.
"
"Excellent well.
"
"Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.
"
"To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
"
"You see this fellow that is gone before;
[p]He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
[p]And give direction: and do but see his vice;
[p]'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
[p]The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.
[p]I fear the trust Othello puts him in.
[p]On some odd time of his infirmity,
[p]Will shake this island.
"
"But is he often thus?
"
"'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
[p]He'll watch the horologe a double set,
[p]If drink rock not his cradle.
"
"It were well
[p]The general were put in mind of it.
[p]Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
[p]Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
[p]And looks not on his evils: is not this true?
"
"[Aside to him] How now, Roderigo!
[p]I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.
"
"And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
[p]Should hazard such a place as his own second
[p]With one of an ingraft infirmity:
[p]It were an honest action to say
[p]So to the Moor.
"
"Not I, for this fair island:
[p]I do love Cassio well; and would do much
[p]To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?
"
"You rogue! you rascal!
"
"What's the matter, lieutenant?
"
"A knave teach me my duty!
[p]I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.
"
"Beat me!
"
"Dost thou prate, rogue?
"
"Nay, good lieutenant;
[p][Staying him]
[p]I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
"
"Let me go, sir,
[p]Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
"
"Come, come,
[p]you're drunk.
"
"Drunk!
"
"[Aside to RODERIGO] Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.
[p][Exit RODERIGO]
[p]Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--
[p]Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;
[p]Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!
[p][Bell rings]
[p]Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!
[p]The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!
[p]You will be shamed for ever.
"
"What is the matter here?
"
"'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
"
"Hold, for your lives!
"
"Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--
[p]Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
[p]Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!
"
"Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
[p]Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
[p]Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
[p]For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
[p]He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
[p]Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
[p]Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
[p]From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
[p]Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
[p]Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.
"
"I do not know: friends all but now, even now,
[p]In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
[p]Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
[p]As if some planet had unwitted men--
[p]Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
[p]In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
[p]Any beginning to this peevish odds;
[p]And would in action glorious I had lost
[p]Those legs that brought me to a part of it!
"
"How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
"
"I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
"
"Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
[p]The gravity and stillness of your youth
[p]The world hath noted, and your name is great
[p]In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
[p]That you unlace your reputation thus
[p]And spend your rich opinion for the name
[p]Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.
"
"Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
[p]Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--
[p]While I spare speech, which something now
[p]offends me,--
[p]Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
[p]By me that's said or done amiss this night;
[p]Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
[p]And to defend ourselves it be a sin
[p]When violence assails us.
"
"Now, by heaven,
[p]My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
[p]And passion, having my best judgment collied,
[p]Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
[p]Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
[p]Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
[p]How this foul rout began, who set it on;
[p]And he that is approved in this offence,
[p]Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
[p]Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
[p]Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
[p]To manage private and domestic quarrel,
[p]In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
[p]'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?
"
"If partially affined, or leagued in office,
[p]Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
[p]Thou art no soldier.
"
"Touch me not so near:
[p]I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
[p]Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
[p]Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
[p]Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
[p]Montano and myself being in speech,
[p]There comes a fellow crying out for help:
[p]And Cassio following him with determined sword,
[p]To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
[p]Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
[p]Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
[p]Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--
[p]The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
[p]Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
[p]For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
[p]And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
[p]I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
[p]For this was brief--I found them close together,
[p]At blow and thrust; even as again they were
[p]When you yourself did part them.
[p]More of this matter cannot I report:
[p]But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
[p]Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
[p]As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
[p]Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
[p]From him that fled some strange indignity,
[p]Which patience could not pass.
"
"I know, Iago,
[p]Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
[p]Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee
[p]But never more be officer of mine.
[p][Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended]
[p]Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
[p]I'll make thee an example.
"
"What's the matter?
"
"All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
[p]Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:
[p]Lead him off.
[p][To MONTANO, who is led off]
[p]Iago, look with care about the town,
[p]And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
[p]Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life
[p]To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
"
"What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
"
"Ay, past all surgery.
"
"Marry, heaven forbid!
"
"Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
[p]my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
[p]myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
[p]Iago, my reputation!
"
"As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
[p]some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
[p]in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
[p]imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
[p]deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
[p]unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
[p]there are ways to recover the general again: you
[p]are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
[p]policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
[p]offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
[p]to him again, and he's yours.
"
"I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
[p]good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
[p]indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
[p]and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
[p]fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
[p]spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
[p]let us call thee devil!
"
"What was he that you followed with your sword? What
[p]had he done to you?
"
"I know not.
"
"Is't possible?
"
"I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
[p]a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
[p]should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
[p]their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
[p]revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!
"
"Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
[p]recovered?
"
"It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
[p]to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
[p]another, to make me frankly despise myself.
"
"Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
[p]the place, and the condition of this country
[p]stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
[p]but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
"
"I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
[p]I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
[p]such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
[p]sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
[p]beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
[p]unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.
"
"Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
[p]if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
[p]And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
"
"I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!
"
"You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.
[p]I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
[p]is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
[p]that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
[p]contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
[p]graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
[p]her help to put you in your place again: she is of
[p]so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
[p]she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
[p]than she is requested: this broken joint between
[p]you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
[p]fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
[p]crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
"
"You advise me well.
"
"I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
"
"I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
[p]beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
[p]I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.
"
"You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I
[p]must to the watch.
"
"And what's he then that says I play the villain?
[p]When this advice is free I give and honest,
[p]Probal to thinking and indeed the course
[p]To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
[p]The inclining Desdemona to subdue
[p]In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
[p]As the free elements. And then for her
[p]To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,
[p]All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
[p]His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
[p]That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
[p]Even as her appetite shall play the god
[p]With his weak function. How am I then a villain
[p]To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
[p]Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
[p]When devils will the blackest sins put on,
[p]They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
[p]As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
[p]Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
[p]And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
[p]I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
[p]That she repeals him for her body's lust;
[p]And by how much she strives to do him good,
[p]She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
[p]So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
[p]And out of her own goodness make the net
[p]That shall enmesh them all.
[p][Re-enter RODERIGO]
[p]How now, Roderigo!
"
"I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
[p]hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
[p]almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
[p]cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
[p]have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
[p]no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
"
"How poor are they that have not patience!
[p]What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
[p]Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
[p]And wit depends on dilatory time.
[p]Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
[p]And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
[p]Though other things grow fair against the sun,
[p]Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
[p]Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
[p]Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
[p]Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
[p]Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
[p]Nay, get thee gone.
[p][Exit RODERIGO]
[p]Two things are to be done:
[p]My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
[p]I'll set her on;
[p]Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
[p]And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
[p]Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way
[p]Dull not device by coldness and delay.
"
"Masters, play here; I will content your pains;
[p]Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'
"
"Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,
[p]that they speak i' the nose thus?
"
"How, sir, how!
"
"Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?
"
"Ay, marry, are they, sir.
"
"O, thereby hangs a tail.
"
"Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
"
"Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.
[p]But, masters, here's money for you: and the general
[p]so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's
[p]sake, to make no more noise with it.
"
"Well, sir, we will not.
"
"If you have any music that may not be heard, to't
[p]again: but, as they say to hear music the general
[p]does not greatly care.
"
"We have none such, sir.
"
"Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:
[p]go; vanish into air; away!
"
"Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
"
"No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
"
"Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece
[p]of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
[p]the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's
[p]one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
[p]wilt thou do this?
"
"She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I
[p]shall seem to notify unto her.
"
"Do, good my friend.
[p][Exit Clown]
[p][Enter IAGO]
[p]In happy time, Iago.
"
"You have not been a-bed, then?
"
"Why, no; the day had broke
[p]Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
[p]To send in to your wife: my suit to her
[p]Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
[p]Procure me some access.
"
"I'll send her to you presently;
[p]And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
[p]Out of the way, that your converse and business
[p]May be more free.
"
"I humbly thank you for't.
[p][Exit IAGO]
[p]I never knew
[p]A Florentine more kind and honest.
"
"Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry
[p]For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
[p]The general and his wife are talking of it;
[p]And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
[p]That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
[p]And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
[p]He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
[p]And needs no other suitor but his likings
[p]To take the safest occasion by the front
[p]To bring you in again.
"
"Yet, I beseech you,
[p]If you think fit, or that it may be done,
[p]Give me advantage of some brief discourse
[p]With Desdemona alone.
"
"Pray you, come in;
[p]I will bestow you where you shall have time
[p]To speak your bosom freely.
"
"I am much bound to you.
"
"These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
[p]And by him do my duties to the senate:
[p]That done, I will be walking on the works;
[p]Repair there to me.
"
"Well, my good lord, I'll do't.
"
"This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?
"
"We'll wait upon your lordship.
"
"Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
[p]All my abilities in thy behalf.
"
"Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
[p]As if the case were his.
"
"O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
[p]But I will have my lord and you again
[p]As friendly as you were.
"
"Bounteous madam,
[p]Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
[p]He's never any thing but your true servant.
"
"I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
[p]You have known him long; and be you well assured
[p]He shall in strangeness stand no further off
[p]Than in a polite distance.
"
"Ay, but, lady,
[p]That policy may either last so long,
[p]Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
[p]Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
[p]That, I being absent and my place supplied,
[p]My general will forget my love and service.
"
"Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
[p]I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
[p]If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
[p]To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
[p]I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
[p]His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
[p]I'll intermingle every thing he does
[p]With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
[p]For thy solicitor shall rather die
[p]Than give thy cause away.
"
"Madam, here comes my lord.
"
"Madam, I'll take my leave.
"
"Why, stay, and hear me speak.
"
"Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
[p]Unfit for mine own purposes.
"
"Well, do your discretion.
"
"Ha! I like not that.
"
"What dost thou say?
"
"Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
"
"Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
"
"Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
[p]That he would steal away so guilty-like,
[p]Seeing you coming.
"
"I do believe 'twas he.
"
"How now, my lord!
[p]I have been talking with a suitor here,
[p]A man that languishes in your displeasure.
"
"Who is't you mean?
"
"Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
[p]If I have any grace or power to move you,
[p]His present reconciliation take;
[p]For if he be not one that truly loves you,
[p]That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
[p]I have no judgment in an honest face:
[p]I prithee, call him back.
"
"Went he hence now?
"
"Ay, sooth; so humbled
[p]That he hath left part of his grief with me,
[p]To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
"
"Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
"
"But shall't be shortly?
"
"The sooner, sweet, for you.
"
"Shall't be to-night at supper?
"
"No, not to-night.
"
"To-morrow dinner, then?
"
"I shall not dine at home;
[p]I meet the captains at the citadel.
"
"Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
[p]On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
[p]I prithee, name the time, but let it not
[p]Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
[p]And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
[p]Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
[p]Out of their best--is not almost a fault
[p]To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
[p]Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
[p]What you would ask me, that I should deny,
[p]Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
[p]That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
[p]When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
[p]Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
[p]To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--
"
"Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
[p]I will deny thee nothing.
"
"Why, this is not a boon;
[p]'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
[p]Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
[p]Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
[p]To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
[p]Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
[p]It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
[p]And fearful to be granted.
"
"I will deny thee nothing:
[p]Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
[p]To leave me but a little to myself.
"
"Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.
"
"Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.
"
"Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
[p]Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
"
"Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
[p]But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
[p]Chaos is come again.
"
"My noble lord--
"
"What dost thou say, Iago?
"
"Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
[p]Know of your love?
"
"He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
"
"But for a satisfaction of my thought;
[p]No further harm.
"
"Why of thy thought, Iago?
"
"I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
"
"O, yes; and went between us very oft.
"
"Indeed!
"
"Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
[p]Is he not honest?
"
"Honest, my lord!
"
"Honest! ay, honest.
"
"My lord, for aught I know.
"
"What dost thou think?
"
"Think, my lord!
"
"Think, my lord!
[p]By heaven, he echoes me,
[p]As if there were some monster in his thought
[p]Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
[p]I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
[p]When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
[p]And when I told thee he was of my counsel
[p]In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
[p]And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
[p]As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
[p]Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
[p]Show me thy thought.
"
"My lord, you know I love you.
"
"I think thou dost;
[p]And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
[p]And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
[p]Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
[p]For such things in a false disloyal knave
[p]Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
[p]They are close delations, working from the heart
[p]That passion cannot rule.
"
"For Michael Cassio,
[p]I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
"
"I think so too.
"
"Men should be what they seem;
[p]Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
"
"Certain, men should be what they seem.
"
"Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.
"
"Nay, yet there's more in this:
[p]I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
[p]As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
[p]The worst of words.
"
"Good my lord, pardon me:
[p]Though I am bound to every act of duty,
[p]I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
[p]Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
[p]As where's that palace whereinto foul things
[p]Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
[p]But some uncleanly apprehensions
[p]Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
[p]With meditations lawful?
"
"Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
[p]If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
[p]A stranger to thy thoughts.
"
"I do beseech you--
[p]Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
[p]As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
[p]To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
[p]Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
[p]From one that so imperfectly conceits,
[p]Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
[p]Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
[p]It were not for your quiet nor your good,
[p]Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
[p]To let you know my thoughts.
"
"What dost thou mean?
"
"Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
[p]Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
[p]Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
[p]'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
[p]But he that filches from me my good name
[p]Robs me of that which not enriches him
[p]And makes me poor indeed.
"
"By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
"
"You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
[p]Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
"
"Ha!
"
"O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
[p]It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
[p]The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
[p]Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
[p]But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
[p]Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
"
"O misery!
"
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
[p]But riches fineless is as poor as winter
[p]To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
[p]Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
[p]From jealousy!
"
"Why, why is this?
[p]Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
[p]To follow still the changes of the moon
[p]With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
[p]Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
[p]When I shall turn the business of my soul
[p]To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
[p]Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
[p]To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
[p]Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
[p]Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
[p]Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
[p]The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
[p]For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
[p]I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
[p]And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
[p]Away at once with love or jealousy!
"
"I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
[p]To show the love and duty that I bear you
[p]With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
[p]Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
[p]Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
[p]Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
[p]I would not have your free and noble nature,
[p]Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
[p]I know our country disposition well;
[p]In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
[p]They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
[p]Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
"
"Dost thou say so?
"
"She did deceive her father, marrying you;
[p]And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
[p]She loved them most.
"
"And so she did.
"
"Why, go to then;
[p]She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
[p]To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
[p]He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
[p]I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
[p]For too much loving you.
"
"I am bound to thee for ever.
"
"I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
"
"Not a jot, not a jot.
"
"I' faith, I fear it has.
[p]I hope you will consider what is spoke
[p]Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
[p]I am to pray you not to strain my speech
[p]To grosser issues nor to larger reach
[p]Than to suspicion.
"
"I will not.
"
"Should you do so, my lord,
[p]My speech should fall into such vile success
[p]As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
[p]My lord, I see you're moved.
"
"No, not much moved:
[p]I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
"
"Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
"
"And yet, how nature erring from itself,--
"
"Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
[p]Not to affect many proposed matches
[p]Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
[p]Whereto we see in all things nature tends--
[p]Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
[p]Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
[p]But pardon me; I do not in position
[p]Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
[p]Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
[p]May fall to match you with her country forms
[p]And happily repent.
"
"Farewell, farewell:
[p]If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
[p]Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:
"
"[Going] My lord, I take my leave.
"
"Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
[p]Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
"
"[Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat
[p]your honour
[p]To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
[p]Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
[p]For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
[p]Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
[p]You shall by that perceive him and his means:
[p]Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
[p]With any strong or vehement importunity;
[p]Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
[p]Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
[p]As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
[p]And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.
"
"Fear not my government.
"
"I once more take my leave.
"
"This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
[p]And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
[p]Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
[p]Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
[p]I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
[p]To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
[p]And have not those soft parts of conversation
[p]That chamberers have, or for I am declined
[p]Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--
[p]She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
[p]Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
[p]That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
[p]And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
[p]And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
[p]Than keep a corner in the thing I love
[p]For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
[p]Prerogatived are they less than the base;
[p]'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
[p]Even then this forked plague is fated to us
[p]When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
[p][Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
[p]If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
[p]I'll not believe't.
"
"How now, my dear Othello!
[p]Your dinner, and the generous islanders
[p]By you invited, do attend your presence.
"
"I am to blame.
"
"Why do you speak so faintly?
[p]Are you not well?
"
"I have a pain upon my forehead here.
"
"'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
[p]Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
[p]It will be well.
"
"Your napkin is too little:
[p][He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops]
[p]Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.
"
"I am very sorry that you are not well.
"
"I am glad I have found this napkin:
[p]This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
[p]My wayward husband hath a hundred times
[p]Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
[p]For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
[p]That she reserves it evermore about her
[p]To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
[p]And give't Iago: what he will do with it
[p]Heaven knows, not I;
[p]I nothing but to please his fantasy.
"
"How now! what do you here alone?
"
"Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
"
"A thing for me? it is a common thing--
"
"Ha!
"
"To have a foolish wife.
"
"O, is that all? What will you give me now
[p]For the same handkerchief?
"
"What handkerchief?
"
"What handkerchief?
[p]Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
[p]That which so often you did bid me steal.
"
"Hast stol'n it from her?
"
"No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
[p]And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
[p]Look, here it is.
"
"A good wench; give it me.
"
"What will you do with 't, that you have been
[p]so earnest
[p]To have me filch it?
"
"[Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?
"
"If it be not for some purpose of import,
[p]Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
[p]When she shall lack it.
"
"Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
[p]Go, leave me.
[p][Exit EMILIA]
[p]I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
[p]And let him find it. Trifles light as air
[p]Are to the jealous confirmations strong
[p]As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
[p]The Moor already changes with my poison:
[p]Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.
[p]Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
[p]But with a little act upon the blood.
[p]Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
[p]Look, where he comes!
[p][Re-enter OTHELLO]
[p]Not poppy, nor mandragora,
[p]Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
[p]Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
[p]Which thou owedst yesterday.
"
"Ha! ha! false to me?
"
"Why, how now, general! no more of that.
"
"Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
[p]I swear 'tis better to be much abused
[p]Than but to know't a little.
"
"How now, my lord!
"
"What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
[p]I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
[p]I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
[p]I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
[p]He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
[p]Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.
"
"I am sorry to hear this.
"
"I had been happy, if the general camp,
[p]Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
[p]So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
[p]Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
[p]Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
[p]That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
[p]Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
[p]The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
[p]The royal banner, and all quality,
[p]Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
[p]And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
[p]The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
[p]Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
"
"Is't possible, my lord?
"
"Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
[p]Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
[p]Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
[p]Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
[p]Than answer my waked wrath!
"
"Is't come to this?
"
"Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
[p]That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
[p]To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
"
"My noble lord,--
"
"If thou dost slander her and torture me,
[p]Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
[p]On horror's head horrors accumulate;
[p]Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
[p]For nothing canst thou to damnation add
[p]Greater than that.
"
"O grace! O heaven forgive me!
[p]Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
[p]God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
[p]That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
[p]O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
[p]To be direct and honest is not safe.
[p]I thank you for this profit; and from hence
[p]I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
"
"Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.
"
"I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
[p]And loses that it works for.
"
"By the world,
[p]I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
[p]I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
[p]I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
[p]As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
[p]As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
[p]Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
[p]I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
"
"I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
[p]I do repent me that I put it to you.
[p]You would be satisfied?
"
"Would! nay, I will.
"
"And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
[p]Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--
[p]Behold her topp'd?
"
"Death and damnation! O!
"
"It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
[p]To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
[p]If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
[p]More than their own! What then? how then?
[p]What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
[p]It is impossible you should see this,
[p]Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
[p]As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
[p]As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
[p]If imputation and strong circumstances,
[p]Which lead directly to the door of truth,
[p]Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
"
"Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
"
"I do not like the office:
[p]But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
[p]Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
[p]I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
[p]And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
[p]I could not sleep.
[p]There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
[p]That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
[p]One of this kind is Cassio:
[p]In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
[p]Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
[p]And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
[p]Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
[p]As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
[p]That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
[p]Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
[p]Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'
"
"O monstrous! monstrous!
"
"Nay, this was but his dream.
"
"But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
[p]'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
"
"And this may help to thicken other proofs
[p]That do demonstrate thinly.
"
"I'll tear her all to pieces.
"
"Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
[p]She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
[p]Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
[p]Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
"
"I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
"
"I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
[p]I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
[p]See Cassio wipe his beard with.
"
"If it be that--
"
"If it be that, or any that was hers,
[p]It speaks against her with the other proofs.
"
"O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
[p]One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
[p]Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
[p]All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
[p]'Tis gone.
[p]Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
[p]Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
[p]To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
[p]For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
"
"Yet be content.
"
"O, blood, blood, blood!
"
"Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
"
"Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
[p]Whose icy current and compulsive course
[p]Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
[p]To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
[p]Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
[p]Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
[p]Till that a capable and wide revenge
[p]Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
[p][Kneels]
[p]In the due reverence of a sacred vow
[p]I here engage my words.
"
"Do not rise yet.
[p][Kneels]
[p]Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
[p]You elements that clip us round about,
[p]Witness that here Iago doth give up
[p]The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
[p]To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
[p]And to obey shall be in me remorse,
[p]What bloody business ever.
"
"I greet thy love,
[p]Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
[p]And will upon the instant put thee to't:
[p]Within these three days let me hear thee say
[p]That Cassio's not alive.
"
"My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
[p]But let her live.
"
"Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
[p]Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
[p]To furnish me with some swift means of death
[p]For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
"
"I am your own for ever.
"
"Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
"
"I dare not say he lies any where.
"
"Why, man?
"
"He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
[p]is stabbing.
"
"Go to: where lodges he?
"
"To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
"
"Can any thing be made of this?
"
"I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
[p]lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
[p]to lie in mine own throat.
"
"Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?
"
"I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
[p]questions, and by them answer.
"
"Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
[p]moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
"
"To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and
[p]therefore I will attempt the doing it.
"
"Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
"
"I know not, madam.
"
"Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
[p]Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
[p]Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
[p]As jealous creatures are, it were enough
[p]To put him to ill thinking.
"
"Is he not jealous?
"
"Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
[p]Drew all such humours from him.
"
"Look, where he comes.
"
"I will not leave him now till Cassio
[p]Be call'd to him.
[p][Enter OTHELLO]
[p]How is't with you, my lord
"
"Well, my good lady.
[p][Aside]
[p]O, hardness to dissemble!--
[p]How do you, Desdemona?
"
"Well, my good lord.
"
"Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.
"
"It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
"
"This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
[p]Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
[p]A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
[p]Much castigation, exercise devout;
[p]For here's a young and sweating devil here,
[p]That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
[p]A frank one.
"
"You may, indeed, say so;
[p]For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
"
"A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
[p]But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
"
"I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
"
"What promise, chuck?
"
"I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
"
"I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
[p]Lend me thy handkerchief.
"
"Here, my lord.
"
"That which I gave you.
"
"I have it not about me.
"
"Not?
"
"No, indeed, my lord.
"
"That is a fault.
[p]That handkerchief
[p]Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
[p]She was a charmer, and could almost read
[p]The thoughts of people: she told her, while
[p]she kept it,
[p]'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
[p]Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
[p]Or made gift of it, my father's eye
[p]Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
[p]After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
[p]And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
[p]To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
[p]Make it a darling like your precious eye;
[p]To lose't or give't away were such perdition
[p]As nothing else could match.
"
"Is't possible?
"
"'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
[p]A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
[p]The sun to course two hundred compasses,
[p]In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
[p]The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
[p]And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
[p]Conserved of maidens' hearts.
"
"Indeed! is't true?
"
"Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
"
"Then would to God that I had never seen't!
"
"Ha! wherefore?
"
"Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
"
"Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out
[p]o' the way?
"
"Heaven bless us!
"
"Say you?
"
"It is not lost; but what an if it were?
"
"How!
"
"I say, it is not lost.
"
"Fetch't, let me see't.
"
"Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
[p]This is a trick to put me from my suit:
[p]Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
"
"Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.
"
"Come, come;
[p]You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
"
"The handkerchief!
"
"I pray, talk me of Cassio.
"
"The handkerchief!
"
"A man that all his time
[p]Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
[p]Shared dangers with you,--
"
"The handkerchief!
"
"In sooth, you are to blame.
"
"Away!
"
"Is not this man jealous?
"
"I ne'er saw this before.
[p]Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
[p]I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
"
"'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
[p]They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
[p]To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
[p]They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!
"
"There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
[p]And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.
"
"How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?
"
"Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
[p]That by your virtuous means I may again
[p]Exist, and be a member of his love
[p]Whom I with all the office of my heart
[p]Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
[p]If my offence be of such mortal kind
[p]That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
[p]Nor purposed merit in futurity,
[p]Can ransom me into his love again,
[p]But to know so must be my benefit;
[p]So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
[p]And shut myself up in some other course,
[p]To fortune's alms.
"
"Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
[p]My advocation is not now in tune;
[p]My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
[p]Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
[p]So help me every spirit sanctified,
[p]As I have spoken for you all my best
[p]And stood within the blank of his displeasure
[p]For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
[p]What I can do I will; and more I will
[p]Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.
"
"Is my lord angry?
"
"He went hence but now,
[p]And certainly in strange unquietness.
"
"Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
[p]When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
[p]And, like the devil, from his very arm
[p]Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
[p]Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
[p]There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.
"
"I prithee, do so.
[p][Exit IAGO]
[p]Something, sure, of state,
[p]Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise
[p]Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
[p]Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
[p]Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
[p]Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
[p]For let our finger ache, and it indues
[p]Our other healthful members even to that sense
[p]Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
[p]Nor of them look for such observances
[p]As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
[p]I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
[p]Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
[p]But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
[p]And he's indicted falsely.
"
"Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
[p]And no conception nor no jealous toy
[p]Concerning you.
"
"Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
"
"But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
[p]They are not ever jealous for the cause,
[p]But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
[p]Begot upon itself, born on itself.
"
"Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
"
"Lady, amen.
"
"I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:
[p]If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
[p]And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
"
"I humbly thank your ladyship.
"
"Save you, friend Cassio!
"
"What make you from home?
[p]How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
[p]I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
"
"And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
[p]What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
[p]Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
[p]More tedious than the dial eight score times?
[p]O weary reckoning!
"
"Pardon me, Bianca:
[p]I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
[p]But I shall, in a more continuate time,
[p]Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
[p][Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief]
[p]Take me this work out.
"
"O Cassio, whence came this?
[p]This is some token from a newer friend:
[p]To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
[p]Is't come to this? Well, well.
"
"Go to, woman!
[p]Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
[p]From whence you have them. You are jealous now
[p]That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
[p]No, in good troth, Bianca.
"
"Why, whose is it?
"
"I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
[p]I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
[p]As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
[p]Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.
"
"Leave you! wherefore?
"
"I do attend here on the general;
[p]And think it no addition, nor my wish,
[p]To have him see me woman'd.
"
"Why, I pray you?
"
"Not that I love you not.
"
"But that you do not love me.
[p]I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
[p]And say if I shall see you soon at night.
"
"'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
[p]For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.
"
"'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.
"
"Will you think so?
"
"Think so, Iago!
"
"What,
[p]To kiss in private?
"
"An unauthorized kiss.
"
"Or to be naked with her friend in bed
[p]An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
"
"Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
[p]It is hypocrisy against the devil:
[p]They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
[p]The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
"
"So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
[p]But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--
"
"What then?
"
"Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
[p]She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
"
"She is protectress of her honour too:
[p]May she give that?
"
"Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
[p]They have it very oft that have it not:
[p]But, for the handkerchief,--
"
"By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
[p]Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,
[p]As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
[p]Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.
"
"Ay, what of that?
"
"That's not so good now.
"
"What,
[p]If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
[p]Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,
[p]Who having, by their own importunate suit,
[p]Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
[p]Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
[p]But they must blab--
"
"Hath he said any thing?
"
"He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
[p]No more than he'll unswear.
"
"What hath he said?
"
"'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.
"
"What? what?
"
"Lie--
"
"With her?
"
"With her, on her; what you will.
"
"Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when
[p]they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
[p]--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To
[p]confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be
[p]hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.
[p]Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
[p]passion without some instruction. It is not words
[p]that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
[p]--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--
"
"Work on,
[p]My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
[p]And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
[p]All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
[p]My lord, I say! Othello!
[p][Enter CASSIO]
[p]How now, Cassio!
"
"What's the matter?
"
"My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
[p]This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
"
"Rub him about the temples.
"
"No, forbear;
[p]The lethargy must have his quiet course:
[p]If not, he foams at mouth and by and by
[p]Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
[p]Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
[p]He will recover straight: when he is gone,
[p]I would on great occasion speak with you.
[p][Exit CASSIO]
[p]How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?
"
"Dost thou mock me?
"
"I mock you! no, by heaven.
[p]Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
"
"A horned man's a monster and a beast.
"
"There's many a beast then in a populous city,
[p]And many a civil monster.
"
"Did he confess it?
"
"Good sir, be a man;
[p]Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
[p]May draw with you: there's millions now alive
[p]That nightly lie in those unproper beds
[p]Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
[p]O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
[p]To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
[p]And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
[p]And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
"
"O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
"
"Stand you awhile apart;
[p]Confine yourself but in a patient list.
[p]Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
[p]A passion most unsuiting such a man--
[p]Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
[p]And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
[p]Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
[p]The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
[p]And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
[p]That dwell in every region of his face;
[p]For I will make him tell the tale anew,
[p]Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
[p]He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
[p]I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
[p]Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
[p]And nothing of a man.
"
"Dost thou hear, Iago?
[p]I will be found most cunning in my patience;
[p]But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.
"
"That's not amiss;
[p]But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
[p][OTHELLO retires]
[p]Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
[p]A housewife that by selling her desires
[p]Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
[p]That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
[p]To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
[p]He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
[p]From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
[p][Re-enter CASSIO]
[p]As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
[p]And his unbookish jealousy must construe
[p]Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
[p]Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?
"
"The worser that you give me the addition
[p]Whose want even kills me.
"
"Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
[p][Speaking lower]
[p]Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
[p]How quickly should you speed!
"
"Alas, poor caitiff!
"
"Look, how he laughs already!
"
"I never knew woman love man so.
"
"Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.
"
"Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.
"
"Do you hear, Cassio?
"
"Now he importunes him
[p]To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.
"
"She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
[p]Do you intend it?
"
"Ha, ha, ha!
"
"Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?
"
"I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
[p]charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
[p]Ha, ha, ha!
"
"So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.
"
"'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
"
"Prithee, say true.
"
"I am a very villain else.
"
"Have you scored me? Well.
"
"This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
[p]persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
[p]flattery, not out of my promise.
"
"Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
"
"She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
[p]I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
[p]certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
[p]and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--
"
"Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
[p]imports it.
"
"So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
[p]and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!
"
"Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
[p]I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
[p]throw it to.
"
"Well, I must leave her company.
"
"Before me! look, where she comes.
"
"'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.
[p][Enter BIANCA]
[p]What do you mean by this haunting of me?
"
"Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
[p]mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
[p]I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
[p]work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find
[p]it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
[p]This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
[p]work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
[p]you had it, I'll take out no work on't.
"
"How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
"
"By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
"
"An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you
[p]will not, come when you are next prepared for.
"
"After her, after her.
"
"'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.
"
"Will you sup there?
"
"'Faith, I intend so.
"
"Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain
[p]speak with you.
"
"Prithee, come; will you?
"
"Go to; say no more.
"
"[Advancing] How shall I murder him, Iago?
"
"Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
"
"O Iago!
"
"And did you see the handkerchief?
"
"Was that mine?
"
"Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
[p]foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he
[p]hath given it his whore.
"
"I would have him nine years a-killing.
[p]A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!
"
"Nay, you must forget that.
"
"Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;
[p]for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to
[p]stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the
[p]world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
[p]an emperor's side and command him tasks.
"
"Nay, that's not your way.
"
"Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
[p]with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
[p]will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
[p]and plenteous wit and invention:--
"
"She's the worse for all this.
"
"O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so
[p]gentle a condition!
"
"Ay, too gentle.
"
"Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!
[p]O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
"
"If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her
[p]patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes
[p]near nobody.
"
"I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!
"
"O, 'tis foul in her.
"
"With mine officer!
"
"That's fouler.
"
"Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not
[p]expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty
[p]unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.
"
"Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even
[p]the bed she hath contaminated.
"
"Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.
"
"And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you
[p]shall hear more by midnight.
"
"Excellent good.
[p][A trumpet within]
[p]What trumpet is that same?
"
"Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
[p]Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.
"
"Save you, worthy general!
"
"With all my heart, sir.
"
"The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
"
"I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
"
"And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
"
"I am very glad to see you, signior
[p]Welcome to Cyprus.
"
"I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
"
"Lives, sir.
"
"Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
[p]An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.
"
"Are you sure of that?
"
"My lord?
"
"[Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will--'
"
"He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
[p]Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
"
"A most unhappy one: I would do much
[p]To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
"
"Fire and brimstone!
"
"My lord?
"
"Are you wise?
"
"What, is he angry?
"
"May be the letter moved him;
[p]For, as I think, they do command him home,
[p]Deputing Cassio in his government.
"
"Trust me, I am glad on't.
"
"Indeed!
"
"My lord?
"
"I am glad to see you mad.
"
"Why, sweet Othello,--
"
"[Striking her] Devil!
"
"I have not deserved this.
"
"My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
[p]Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:
[p]Make her amends; she weeps.
"
"O devil, devil!
[p]If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
[p]Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
[p]Out of my sight!
"
"I will not stay to offend you.
"
"Truly, an obedient lady:
[p]I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
"
"Mistress!
"
"My lord?
"
"What would you with her, sir?
"
"Who, I, my lord?
"
"Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
[p]Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
[p]And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
[p]And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
[p]Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
[p]Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!--
[p]I am commanded home. Get you away;
[p]I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
[p]And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
[p][Exit DESDEMONA]
[p]Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
[p]I do entreat that we may sup together:
[p]You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!
"
"Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
[p]Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
[p]Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
[p]The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,
[p]Could neither graze nor pierce?
"
"He is much changed.
"
"Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?
"
"He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
[p]What he might be: if what he might he is not,
[p]I would to heaven he were!
"
"What, strike his wife!
"
"'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
[p]That stroke would prove the worst!
"
"Is it his use?
[p]Or did the letters work upon his blood,
[p]And new-create this fault?
"
"Alas, alas!
[p]It is not honesty in me to speak
[p]What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
[p]And his own courses will denote him so
[p]That I may save my speech: do but go after,
[p]And mark how he continues.
"
"I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
"
"You have seen nothing then?
"
"Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
"
"Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
"
"But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
[p]Each syllable that breath made up between them.
"
"What, did they never whisper?
"
"Never, my lord.
"
"Nor send you out o' the way?
"
"Never.
"
"To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
"
"Never, my lord.
"
"That's strange.
"
"I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
[p]Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
[p]Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
[p]If any wretch have put this in your head,
[p]Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
[p]For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
[p]There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
[p]Is foul as slander.
"
"Bid her come hither: go.
[p][Exit EMILIA]
[p]She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
[p]That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
[p]A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
[p]And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
"
"My lord, what is your will?
"
"Pray, chuck, come hither.
"
"What is your pleasure?
"
"Let me see your eyes;
[p]Look in my face.
"
"What horrible fancy's this?
"
"[To EMILIA] Some of your function, mistress;
[p]Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
[p]Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:
[p]Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.
"
"Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
[p]I understand a fury in your words.
[p]But not the words.
"
"Why, what art thou?
"
"Your wife, my lord; your true
[p]And loyal wife.
"
"Come, swear it, damn thyself
[p]Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
[p]Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
[p]Swear thou art honest.
"
"Heaven doth truly know it.
"
"Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
"
"To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
"
"O Desdemona! away! away! away!
"
"Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
[p]Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
[p]If haply you my father do suspect
[p]An instrument of this your calling back,
[p]Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
[p]Why, I have lost him too.
"
"Had it pleased heaven
[p]To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
[p]All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
[p]Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
[p]Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
[p]I should have found in some place of my soul
[p]A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
[p]A fixed figure for the time of scorn
[p]To point his slow unmoving finger at!
[p]Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
[p]But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
[p]Where either I must live, or bear no life;
[p]The fountain from the which my current runs,
[p]Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
[p]Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
[p]To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
[p]Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--
[p]Ay, there, look grim as hell!
"
"I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
"
"O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
[p]That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
[p]Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
[p]That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
[p]ne'er been born!
"
"Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
"
"Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
[p]Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
[p]Committed! O thou public commoner!
[p]I should make very forges of my cheeks,
[p]That would to cinders burn up modesty,
[p]Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
[p]Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
[p]The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
[p]Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
[p]And will not hear it. What committed!
[p]Impudent strumpet!
"
"By heaven, you do me wrong.
"
"Are you not a strumpet?
"
"No, as I am a Christian:
[p]If to preserve this vessel for my lord
[p]From any other foul unlawful touch
[p]Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
"
"What, not a whore?
"
"No, as I shall be saved.
"
"Is't possible?
"
"O, heaven forgive us!
"
"I cry you mercy, then:
[p]I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
[p]That married with Othello.
[p][Raising his voice]
[p]You, mistress,
[p]That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
[p]And keep the gate of hell!
[p][Re-enter EMILIA]
[p]You, you, ay, you!
[p]We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
[p]I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.
"
"Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
[p]How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?
"
"'Faith, half asleep.
"
"Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
"
"With who?
"
"Why, with my lord, madam.
"
"Who is thy lord?
"
"He that is yours, sweet lady.
"
"I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
[p]I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
[p]But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
[p]Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
[p]And call thy husband hither.
"
"Here's a change indeed!
"
"'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
[p]How have I been behaved, that he might stick
[p]The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
"
"What is your pleasure, madam?
[p]How is't with you?
"
"I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
[p]Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
[p]He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
[p]I am a child to chiding.
"
"What's the matter, lady?
"
"Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
[p]Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
[p]As true hearts cannot bear.
"
"Am I that name, Iago?
"
"What name, fair lady?
"
"Such as she says my lord did say I was.
"
"He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
[p]Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.
"
"Why did he so?
"
"I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
"
"Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
"
"Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
[p]Her father and her country and her friends,
[p]To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?
"
"It is my wretched fortune.
"
"Beshrew him for't!
[p]How comes this trick upon him?
"
"Nay, heaven doth know.
"
"I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
[p]Some busy and insinuating rogue,
[p]Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
[p]Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.
"
"Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
"
"If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
"
"A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
[p]Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
[p]What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
[p]The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
[p]Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
[p]O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
[p]And put in every honest hand a whip
[p]To lash the rascals naked through the world
[p]Even from the east to the west!
"
"Speak within door.
"
"O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
[p]That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
[p]And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
"
"You are a fool; go to.
"
"O good Iago,
[p]What shall I do to win my lord again?
[p]Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
[p]I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
[p]If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
[p]Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
[p]Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
[p]Delighted them in any other form;
[p]Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
[p]And ever will--though he do shake me off
[p]To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
[p]Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
[p]And his unkindness may defeat my life,
[p]But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
[p]It does abhor me now I speak the word;
[p]To do the act that might the addition earn
[p]Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
"
"I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
[p]The business of the state does him offence,
[p]And he does chide with you.
"
"If 'twere no other--
"
"'Tis but so, I warrant.
[p][Trumpets within]
[p]Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
[p]The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
[p]Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
[p][Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
[p][Enter RODERIGO]
[p]How now, Roderigo!
"
"I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
"
"What in the contrary?
"
"Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;
[p]and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
[p]all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
[p]advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
[p]it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
[p]already I have foolishly suffered.
"
"Will you hear me, Roderigo?
"
"'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
[p]performances are no kin together.
"
"You charge me most unjustly.
"
"With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
[p]my means. The jewels you have had from me to
[p]deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
[p]votarist: you have told me she hath received them
[p]and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
[p]respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
"
"Well; go to; very well.
"
"Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis
[p]not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
[p]to find myself fobbed in it.
"
"Very well.
"
"I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
[p]known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
[p]jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
[p]unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
[p]will seek satisfaction of you.
"
"You have said now.
"
"Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
"
"Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
[p]this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
[p]ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
[p]taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
[p]protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
"
"It hath not appeared.
"
"I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
[p]suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
[p]Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
[p]have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
[p]purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
[p]thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
[p]take me from this world with treachery and devise
[p]engines for my life.
"
"Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?
"
"Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice
[p]to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
"
"Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
[p]return again to Venice.
"
"O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
[p]him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
[p]lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
[p]so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
"
"How do you mean, removing of him?
"
"Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
[p]knocking out his brains.
"
"And that you would have me to do?
"
"Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
[p]He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
[p]go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
[p]fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
[p]I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
[p]you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
[p]to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
[p]us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
[p]me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
[p]that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
[p]him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
[p]to waste: about it.
"
"I will hear further reason for this.
"
"And you shall be satisfied.
"
"I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
"
"O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
"
"Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
"
"Your honour is most welcome.
"
"Will you walk, sir?
[p]O,--Desdemona,--
"
"My lord?
"
"Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
[p]forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.
"
"I will, my lord.
"
"How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.
"
"He says he will return incontinent:
[p]He hath commanded me to go to bed,
[p]And bade me to dismiss you.
"
"Dismiss me!
"
"It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.
[p]Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
[p]We must not now displease him.
"
"I would you had never seen him!
"
"So would not I. my love doth so approve him,
[p]That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--
[p]Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.
"
"I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
"
"All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
[p]If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me
[p]In one of those same sheets.
"
"Come, come you talk.
"
"My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
[p]She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
[p]And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
[p]An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
[p]And she died singing it: that song to-night
[p]Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,
[p]But to go hang my head all at one side,
[p]And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.
"
"Shall I go fetch your night-gown?
"
"No, unpin me here.
[p]This Lodovico is a proper man.
"
"A very handsome man.
"
"He speaks well.
"
"I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
[p]to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
"
"[Singing] The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
[p]Sing all a green willow:
[p]Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
[p]Sing willow, willow, willow:
[p]The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
[p]Sing willow, willow, willow;
[p]Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;
[p]Lay by these:--
[p][Singing]
[p]Sing willow, willow, willow;
[p]Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--
[p][Singing]
[p]Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
[p]Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-
[p]Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?
"
"It's the wind.
"
"[Singing] I call'd my love false love; but what
[p]said he then?
[p]Sing willow, willow, willow:
[p]If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!
[p]So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
[p]Doth that bode weeping?
"
"'Tis neither here nor there.
"
"I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
[p]Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--
[p]That there be women do abuse their husbands
[p]In such gross kind?
"
"There be some such, no question.
"
"Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
"
"Why, would not you?
"
"No, by this heavenly light!
"
"Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
[p]I might do't as well i' the dark.
"
"Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
"
"The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
[p]For a small vice.
"
"In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
"
"In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had
[p]done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a
[p]joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
[p]gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
[p]exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would
[p]not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
[p]monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.
"
"Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
[p]For the whole world.
"
"Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
[p]having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
[p]own world, and you might quickly make it right.
"
"I do not think there is any such woman.
"
"Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would
[p]store the world they played for.
[p]But I do think it is their husbands' faults
[p]If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
[p]And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
[p]Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
[p]Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
[p]Or scant our former having in despite;
[p]Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
[p]Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
[p]Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
[p]And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
[p]As husbands have. What is it that they do
[p]When they change us for others? Is it sport?
[p]I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
[p]I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
[p]It is so too: and have not we affections,
[p]Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
[p]Then let them use us well: else let them know,
[p]The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
"
"Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
[p]Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
"
"Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
[p]Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
[p]Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
[p]It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
[p]And fix most firm thy resolution.
"
"Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
"
"Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.
"
"I have no great devotion to the deed;
[p]And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
[p]'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.
"
"I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
[p]And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
[p]Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
[p]Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
[p]He calls me to a restitution large
[p]Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
[p]As gifts to Desdemona;
[p]It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
[p]He hath a daily beauty in his life
[p]That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
[p]May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
[p]No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.
"
"I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!
"
"That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
[p]But that my coat is better than thou know'st
[p]I will make proof of thine.
"
"O, I am slain!
"
"I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!
"
"The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.
"
"O, villain that I am!
"
"It is even so.
"
"O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!
"
"'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,
[p]That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
[p]Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
[p]And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
[p]Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
[p]Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.
"
"What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!
"
"'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
"
"O, help!
"
"Hark!
"
"O wretched villain!
"
"Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
[p]These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
[p]To come in to the cry without more help.
"
"Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
"
"Hark!
"
"Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
"
"Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?
"
"We do not know.
"
"Did not you hear a cry?
"
"Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
"
"What's the matter?
"
"This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
"
"The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
"
"What are you here that cry so grievously?
"
"Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
[p]Give me some help.
"
"O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?
"
"I think that one of them is hereabout,
[p]And cannot make away.
"
"O treacherous villains!
[p]What are you there? come in, and give some help.
"
"O, help me here!
"
"That's one of them.
"
"O murderous slave! O villain!
"
"O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
"
"Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
[p]How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--
[p]What may you be? are you of good or evil?
"
"As you shall prove us, praise us.
"
"Signior Lodovico?
"
"He, sir.
"
"I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
"
"Cassio!
"
"How is't, brother!
"
"My leg is cut in two.
"
"Marry, heaven forbid!
[p]Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
"
"What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?
"
"Who is't that cried!
"
"O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
[p]Cassio, Cassio!
"
"O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
[p]Who they should be that have thus many led you?
"
"No.
"
"I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.
"
"Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
[p]To bear him easily hence!
"
"Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
"
"Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
[p]To be a party in this injury.
[p]Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
[p]Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
[p]Alas my friend and my dear countryman
[p]Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.
"
"What, of Venice?
"
"Even he, sir; did you know him?
"
"Know him! ay.
"
"Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
[p]These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
[p]That so neglected you.
"
"I am glad to see you.
"
"How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
"
"Roderigo!
"
"He, he 'tis he.
[p][A chair brought in]
[p]O, that's well said; the chair!
"
"Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
[p]I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
[p][To BIANCA]
[p]For you, mistress,
[p]Save you your labour. He that lies slain
[p]here, Cassio,
[p]Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?
"
"None in the world; nor do I know the man.
"
"[To BIANCA] What, look you pale? O, bear him out
[p]o' the air.
[p][CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off]
[p]Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
[p]Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
[p]Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
[p]Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
[p]Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
[p]Though tongues were out of use.
"
"'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?
"
"Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
[p]By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
[p]He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
"
"Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
"
"This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
[p]Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
[p][To BIANCA]
[p]What, do you shake at that?
"
"He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
"
"O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
"
"Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
"
"I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
[p]As you that thus abuse me.
"
"As I! foh! fie upon thee!
"
"Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
[p]Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
[p]Emilia run you to the citadel,
[p]And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
[p]Will you go on? I pray.
[p][Aside]
[p]This is the night
[p]That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
"
"It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--
[p]Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--
[p]It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;
[p]Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
[p]And smooth as monumental alabaster.
[p]Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
[p]Put out the light, and then put out the light:
[p]If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
[p]I can again thy former light restore,
[p]Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,
[p]Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
[p]I know not where is that Promethean heat
[p]That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
[p]I cannot give it vital growth again.
[p]It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.
[p][Kissing her]
[p]Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
[p]Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
[p]Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
[p]And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
[p]So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
[p]But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;
[p]It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
"
"Who's there? Othello?
"
"Ay. Desdemona.
"
"Will you come to bed, my lord?
"
"Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"If you bethink yourself of any crime
[p]Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
[p]Solicit for it straight.
"
"Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?
"
"Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
[p]I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
[p]No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.
"
"Talk you of killing?
"
"Ay, I do.
"
"Then heaven
[p]Have mercy on me!
"
"Amen, with all my heart!
"
"If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
"
"Hum!
"
"And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
[p]When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
[p]Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.
"
"Think on thy sins.
"
"They are loves I bear to you.
"
"Ay, and for that thou diest.
"
"That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
[p]Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
[p]Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
[p]These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
[p]They do not point on me.
"
"Peace, and be still!
"
"I will so. What's the matter?
"
"That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
[p]Thou gavest to Cassio.
"
"No, by my life and soul!
[p]Send for the man, and ask him.
"
"Sweet soul, take heed,
[p]Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.
"
"Ay, but not yet to die.
"
"Yes, presently:
[p]Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
[p]For to deny each article with oath
[p]Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
[p]That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.
"
"Then Lord have mercy on me!
"
"I say, amen.
"
"And have you mercy too! I never did
[p]Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
[p]But with such general warranty of heaven
[p]As I might love: I never gave him token.
"
"By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
[p]O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
[p]And makest me call what I intend to do
[p]A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
[p]I saw the handkerchief.
"
"He found it then;
[p]I never gave it him: send for him hither;
[p]Let him confess a truth.
"
"He hath confess'd.
"
"What, my lord?
"
"That he hath used thee.
"
"How? unlawfully?
"
"Ay.
"
"He will not say so.
"
"No, his mouth is stopp'd;
[p]Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
"
"O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?
"
"Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
[p]Had stomach for them all.
"
"Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.
"
"Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?
"
"O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
"
"Down, strumpet!
"
"Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!
"
"Nay, if you strive--
"
"But half an hour!
"
"Being done, there is no pause.
"
"But while I say one prayer!
"
"It is too late.
"
"[Within] My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!
"
"What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
[p]I that am cruel am yet merciful;
[p]I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.
"
"[Within] What, ho! my lord, my lord!
"
"Who's there?
"
"[Within] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
"
"Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
[p]'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--
[p]The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
[p]Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--
[p]I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?
[p]If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
[p]My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
[p]O insupportable! O heavy hour!
[p]Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
[p]Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
[p]Should yawn at alteration.
"
"[Within] I do beseech you
[p]That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!
"
"I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;
[p]Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
[p]Where art thou?
[p][Unlocks the door]
[p][Enter EMILIA]
[p]What's the matter with thee now?
"
"O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!
"
"What, now?
"
"But now, my lord.
"
"It is the very error of the moon;
[p]She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
[p]And makes men mad.
"
"Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
[p]Call'd Roderigo.
"
"Roderigo kill'd!
[p]And Cassio kill'd!
"
"No, Cassio is not kill'd.
"
"Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
[p]And sweet revenge grows harsh.
"
"O, falsely, falsely murder'd!
"
"Alas, what cry is that?
"
"That! what?
"
"Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
[p]Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
[p]Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!
"
"A guiltless death I die.
"
"O, who hath done this deed?
"
"Nobody; I myself. Farewell
[p]Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!
"
"Why, how should she be murder'd?
"
"Alas, who knows?
"
"You heard her say herself, it was not I.
"
"She said so: I must needs report the truth.
"
"She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
[p]'Twas I that kill'd her.
"
"O, the more angel she,
[p]And you the blacker devil!
"
"She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
"
"Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
"
"She was false as water.
"
"Thou art rash as fire, to say
[p]That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!
"
"Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
[p]O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
[p]But that I did proceed upon just grounds
[p]To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.
"
"My husband!
"
"Thy husband.
"
"That she was false to wedlock?
"
"Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
[p]If heaven would make me such another world
[p]Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,
[p]I'ld not have sold her for it.
"
"My husband!
"
"Ay, 'twas he that told me first:
[p]An honest man he is, and hates the slime
[p]That sticks on filthy deeds.
"
"My husband!
"
"What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.
"
"O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,
[p]My husband say that she was false!
"
"He, woman;
[p]I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
[p]My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
"
"If he say so, may his pernicious soul
[p]Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
[p]She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
"
"Ha!
"
"Do thy worst:
[p]This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
[p]Than thou wast worthy her.
"
"Peace, you were best.
"
"Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
[p]As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
[p]As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
[p]I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
[p]Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!
[p]The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!
"
"What is the matter? How now, general!
"
"O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
[p]That men must lay their murders on your neck.
"
"What is the matter?
"
"Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
[p]He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
[p]I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
[p]Speak, for my heart is full.
"
"I told him what I thought, and told no more
[p]Than what he found himself was apt and true.
"
"But did you ever tell him she was false?
"
"I did.
"
"You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
[p]Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
[p]She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?
"
"With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
"
"I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
[p]My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--
"
"O heavens forfend!
"
"And your reports have set the murder on.
"
"Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.
"
"'Tis a strange truth.
"
"O monstrous act!
"
"Villany, villany, villany!
[p]I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--
[p]I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
[p]O villany, villany!
"
"What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
"
"Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
[p]'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
[p]Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
"
"O! O! O!
"
"Nay, lay thee down and roar;
[p]For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
[p]That e'er did lift up eye.
"
"[Rising] O, she was foul!
[p]I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
[p]Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
[p]I know this act shows horrible and grim.
"
"Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:
[p]Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
[p]Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
[p]This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
[p]Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
[p]And fall to reprobation.
"
"'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
[p]That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
[p]A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
[p]And she did gratify his amorous works
[p]With that recognizance and pledge of love
[p]Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
[p]It was a handkerchief, an antique token
[p]My father gave my mother.
"
"O heaven! O heavenly powers!
"
"Come, hold your peace.
"
"'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
[p]No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
[p]Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
[p]All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.
"
"Be wise, and get you home.
"
"I will not.
"
"Fie!
[p]Your sword upon a woman?
"
"O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
[p]I found by fortune and did give my husband;
[p]For often, with a solemn earnestness,
[p]More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
[p]He begg'd of me to steal it.
"
"Villanous whore!
"
"She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
[p]And I did give't my husband.
"
"Filth, thou liest!
"
"By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
[p]O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
[p]Do with so good a woman?
"
"Are there no stones in heaven
[p]But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!
"
"The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
"
"Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.
"
"He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
"
"'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
[p]Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:
[p]Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
[p]But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
[p]For 'tis a damned slave.
"
"I am not valiant neither,
[p]But ever puny whipster gets my sword:
[p]But why should honour outlive honesty?
[p]Let it go all.
"
"What did thy song bode, lady?
[p]Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
[p]And die in music.
[p][Singing]
[p]Willow, willow, willow,--
[p]Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
[p]So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
[p]So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
"
"I have another weapon in this chamber;
[p]It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--
[p]O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
"
"[Within] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:
[p]Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
"
"Look in upon me then and speak with me,
[p]Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
"
"What is the matter?
"
"Behold, I have a weapon;
[p]A better never did itself sustain
[p]Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
[p]That, with this little arm and this good sword,
[p]I have made my way through more impediments
[p]Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
[p]Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
[p]Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
[p]Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
[p]And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
[p]Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
[p]Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
[p]And he retires. Where should Othello go?
[p]Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
[p]Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
[p]This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
[p]And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
[p]Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
[p]Whip me, ye devils,
[p]From the possession of this heavenly sight!
[p]Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
[p]Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
[p]O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
[p]Oh! Oh! Oh!
[p][Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair,]
[p]and Officers with IAGO, prisoner]
"
"Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
"
"That's he that was Othello: here I am.
"
"Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.
"
"I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
[p]If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.
"
"Wrench his sword from him.
"
"I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.
"
"I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
[p]For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.
"
"O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,
[p]Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,
[p]What shall be said to thee?
"
"Why, any thing:
[p]An honourable murderer, if you will;
[p]For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.
"
"This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
[p]Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?
"
"Ay.
"
"Dear general, I never gave you cause.
"
"I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
[p]Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
[p]Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
"
"Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
[p]From this time forth I never will speak word.
"
"What, not to pray?
"
"Torments will ope your lips.
"
"Well, thou dost best.
"
"Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
[p]Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
[p]Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
[p]And here another: the one of them imports
[p]The death of Cassio to be undertook
[p]By Roderigo.
"
"O villain!
"
"Most heathenish and most gross!
"
"Now here's another discontented paper,
[p]Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
[p]Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
[p]But that belike Iago in the interim
[p]Came in and satisfied him.
"
"O the pernicious caitiff!
[p]How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
[p]That was my wife's?
"
"I found it in my chamber:
[p]And he himself confess'd but even now
[p]That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
[p]Which wrought to his desire.
"
"O fool! fool! fool!
"
"There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
[p]How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
[p]Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
[p]That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
[p]After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
[p]Iago set him on.
"
"You must forsake this room, and go with us:
[p]Your power and your command is taken off,
[p]And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
[p]If there be any cunning cruelty
[p]That can torment him much and hold him long,
[p]It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
[p]Till that the nature of your fault be known
[p]To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.
"
"Soft you; a word or two before you go.
[p]I have done the state some service, and they know't.
[p]No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
[p]When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
[p]Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
[p]Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
[p]Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
[p]Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
[p]Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
[p]Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
[p]Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
[p]Albeit unused to the melting mood,
[p]Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
[p]Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
[p]And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
[p]Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
[p]Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
[p]I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
[p]And smote him, thus.
"
"O bloody period!
"
"All that's spoke is marr'd.
"
"I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;
[p]Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
"
"This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
[p]For he was great of heart.
"
"[To IAGO] O Spartan dog,
[p]More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
[p]Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
[p]This is thy work: the object poisons sight;
[p]Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
[p]And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
[p]For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,
[p]Remains the censure of this hellish villain;
[p]The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!
[p]Myself will straight aboard: and to the state
[p]This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
"
"Two households, both alike in dignity,

[p]In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

[p]From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

[p]Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

[p]From forth the fatal loins of these two foes

[p]A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;

[p]Whose misadventured piteous overthrows

[p]Do with their death bury their parents' strife.

[p]The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,

[p]And the continuance of their parents' rage,

[p]Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,

[p]Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;

[p]The which if you with patient ears attend,

[p]What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

"
"Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
"
"No, for then we should be colliers.
"
"I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
"
"Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
"
"I strike quickly, being moved.
"
"But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
"
"A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
"
"To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
[p]therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
"
"A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
[p]take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
"
"That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
[p]to the wall.
"
"True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
[p]are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
[p]Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
[p]to the wall.
"
"The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
"
"'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
[p]have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
[p]maids, and cut off their heads.
"
"The heads of the maids?
"
"Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
[p]take it in what sense thou wilt.
"
"They must take it in sense that feel it.
"
"Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
[p]'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
"
"'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
[p]hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
[p]two of the house of the Montagues.
"
"My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
"
"How! turn thy back and run?
"
"Fear me not.
"
"No, marry; I fear thee!
"
"Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
"
"I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
[p]they list.
"
"Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
[p]which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
"
"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
"
"I do bite my thumb, sir.
"
"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
"
"[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
[p]ay?
"
"No.
"
"No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
[p]bite my thumb, sir.
"
"Do you quarrel, sir?
"
"Quarrel sir! no, sir.
"
"If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
"
"No better.
"
"Well, sir.
"
"Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
"
"Yes, better, sir.
"
"You lie.
"
"Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
"
"Part, fools!
[p]Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
"
"What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
[p]Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
"
"I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
[p]Or manage it to part these men with me.
"
"What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,

[p]As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:

[p]Have at thee, coward!

[p][They fight]

[p][Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;

[p]then enter Citizens, with clubs]

"
"Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
[p]Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
"
"What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
"
"A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
"
"My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
[p]And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
"
"Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
"
"Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
"
"Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
[p]Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
[p]Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
[p]That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
[p]With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
[p]On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
[p]Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
[p]And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
[p]Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
[p]By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
[p]Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
[p]And made Verona's ancient citizens
[p]Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
[p]To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
[p]Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
[p]If ever you disturb our streets again,
[p]Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
[p]For this time, all the rest depart away:
[p]You Capulet; shall go along with me:
[p]And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
[p]To know our further pleasure in this case,
[p]To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
[p]Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
"
"Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
[p]Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
"
"Here were the servants of your adversary,
[p]And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
[p]I drew to part them: in the instant came
[p]The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
[p]Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
[p]He swung about his head and cut the winds,
[p]Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
[p]While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
[p]Came more and more and fought on part and part,
[p]Till the prince came, who parted either part.
"
"O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
[p]Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
"
"Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
[p]Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
[p]A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
[p]Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
[p]That westward rooteth from the city's side,
[p]So early walking did I see your son:
[p]Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
[p]And stole into the covert of the wood:
[p]I, measuring his affections by my own,
[p]That most are busied when they're most alone,
[p]Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
[p]And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
"
"Many a morning hath he there been seen,
[p]With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
[p]Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
[p]But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
[p]Should in the furthest east begin to draw
[p]The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
[p]Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
[p]And private in his chamber pens himself,
[p]Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
[p]And makes himself an artificial night:
[p]Black and portentous must this humour prove,
[p]Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
"
"My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
"
"I neither know it nor can learn of him.
"
"Have you importuned him by any means?
"
"Both by myself and many other friends:
[p]But he, his own affections' counsellor,
[p]Is to himself--I will not say how true--
[p]But to himself so secret and so close,
[p]So far from sounding and discovery,
[p]As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
[p]Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
[p]Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
[p]Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
[p]We would as willingly give cure as know.
"
"See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
[p]I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
"
"I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
[p]To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
"
"Good-morrow, cousin.
"
"Is the day so young?
"
"But new struck nine.
"
"Ay me! sad hours seem long.
[p]Was that my father that went hence so fast?
"
"It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
"
"Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
"
"In love?
"
"Out--
"
"Of love?
"
"Out of her favour, where I am in love.
"
"Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
[p]Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
"
"Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
[p]Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
[p]Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
[p]Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
[p]Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
[p]Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
[p]O any thing, of nothing first create!
[p]O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
[p]Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
[p]Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
[p]sick health!
[p]Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
[p]This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
[p]Dost thou not laugh?
"
"No, coz, I rather weep.
"
"Good heart, at what?
"
"At thy good heart's oppression.
"
"Why, such is love's transgression.
[p]Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
[p]Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
[p]With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
[p]Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
[p]Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
[p]Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
[p]Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
[p]What is it else? a madness most discreet,
[p]A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
[p]Farewell, my coz.
"
"Soft! I will go along;
[p]An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
"
"Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
[p]This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
"
"Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
"
"What, shall I groan and tell thee?
"
"Groan! why, no.
[p]But sadly tell me who.
"
"Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
[p]Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
[p]In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
"
"I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
"
"A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
"
"A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
"
"Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
[p]With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
[p]And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
[p]From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
[p]She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
[p]Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
[p]Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
[p]O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
[p]That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
"
"Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
"
"She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
[p]For beauty starved with her severity
[p]Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
[p]She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
[p]To merit bliss by making me despair:
[p]She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
[p]Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
"
"Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
"
"O, teach me how I should forget to think.
"
"By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
[p]Examine other beauties.
"
"'Tis the way
[p]To call hers exquisite, in question more:
[p]These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
[p]Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
[p]He that is strucken blind cannot forget
[p]The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
[p]Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
[p]What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
[p]Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
[p]Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
"
"I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
"
"But Montague is bound as well as I,
[p]In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
[p]For men so old as we to keep the peace.
"
"Of honourable reckoning are you both;
[p]And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
[p]But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
"
"But saying o'er what I have said before:
[p]My child is yet a stranger in the world;
[p]She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
[p]Let two more summers wither in their pride,
[p]Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
"
"Younger than she are happy mothers made.
"
"And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
[p]The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
[p]She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
[p]But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
[p]My will to her consent is but a part;
[p]An she agree, within her scope of choice
[p]Lies my consent and fair according voice.
[p]This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
[p]Whereto I have invited many a guest,
[p]Such as I love; and you, among the store,
[p]One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
[p]At my poor house look to behold this night
[p]Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
[p]Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
[p]When well-apparell'd April on the heel
[p]Of limping winter treads, even such delight
[p]Among fresh female buds shall you this night
[p]Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
[p]And like her most whose merit most shall be:
[p]Which on more view, of many mine being one
[p]May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
[p]Come, go with me.
[p][To Servant, giving a paper]
[p]Go, sirrah, trudge about
[p]Through fair Verona; find those persons out
[p]Whose names are written there, and to them say,
[p]My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
"
"Find them out whose names are written here! It is
[p]written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
[p]yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
[p]his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
[p]sent to find those persons whose names are here
[p]writ, and can never find what names the writing
[p]person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
"
"Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
[p]One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
[p]Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
[p]One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
[p]Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
[p]And the rank poison of the old will die.
"
"Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
"
"For what, I pray thee?
"
"For your broken shin.
"
"Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
"
"Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
[p]Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
[p]Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
"
"God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
"
"Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
"
"Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
[p]pray, can you read any thing you see?
"
"Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
"
"Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
"
"Stay, fellow; I can read.

"Up.

"Whither?

"To supper; to our house.

"Whose house?
"
"My master's.

"Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
"
"Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
[p]great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
[p]of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
[p]Rest you merry!

"Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
[p]Herself poised with herself in either eye:
[p]But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
[p]Your lady's love against some other maid
[p]That I will show you shining at this feast,
[p]And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
"
"I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
[p]But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
"
"Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
"
"Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
[p]I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
[p]God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
"
"How now! who calls?
"
"Your mother.
"
"Madam, I am here.
[p]What is your will?
"
"This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
[p]We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
[p]I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
[p]Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
"
"Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
"
"She's not fourteen.
"
"I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
[p]And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
[p]She is not fourteen. How long is it now
[p]To Lammas-tide?
"
"A fortnight and odd days.
"
"Even or odd, of all days in the year,
[p]Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
[p]Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
[p]Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
[p]She was too good for me: but, as I said,
[p]On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
[p]That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
[p]'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
[p]And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
[p]Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
[p]For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
[p]Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
[p]My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
[p]Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
[p]When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
[p]Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
[p]To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
[p]Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
[p]To bid me trudge:
[p]And since that time it is eleven years;
[p]For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
[p]She could have run and waddled all about;
[p]For even the day before, she broke her brow:
[p]And then my husband--God be with his soul!
[p]A' was a merry man--took up the child:
[p]'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
[p]Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
[p]Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
[p]The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
[p]To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
[p]I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
[p]I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
[p]And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
"
"Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
"
"Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
[p]To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
[p]And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
[p]A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
[p]A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
[p]'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
[p]Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
[p]Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
"
"And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
"
"Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
[p]Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
[p]An I might live to see thee married once,
[p]I have my wish.
"
"Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
[p]I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
[p]How stands your disposition to be married?
"
"It is an honour that I dream not of.
"
"An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
[p]I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
"
"Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
[p]Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
[p]Are made already mothers: by my count,
[p]I was your mother much upon these years
[p]That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
[p]The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
"
"A man, young lady! lady, such a man
[p]As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
"
"Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
"
"Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
"
"What say you? can you love the gentleman?
[p]This night you shall behold him at our feast;
[p]Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
[p]And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
[p]Examine every married lineament,
[p]And see how one another lends content
[p]And what obscured in this fair volume lies
[p]Find written in the margent of his eyes.
[p]This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
[p]To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
[p]The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
[p]For fair without the fair within to hide:
[p]That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
[p]That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
[p]So shall you share all that he doth possess,
[p]By having him, making yourself no less.
"
"No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
"
"Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
"
"I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
[p]But no more deep will I endart mine eye
[p]Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
"
"Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
[p]called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
[p]the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
[p]hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
"
"We follow thee.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p]Juliet, the county stays.
"
"Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
"
"What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
[p]Or shall we on without a apology?
"
"The date is out of such prolixity:
[p]We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
[p]Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
[p]Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
[p]Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
[p]After the prompter, for our entrance:
[p]But let them measure us by what they will;
[p]We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
"
"Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
[p]Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
"
"Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
"
"Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
[p]With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
[p]So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
"
"You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
[p]And soar with them above a common bound.
"
"I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
[p]To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
[p]I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
[p]Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
"
"And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
[p]Too great oppression for a tender thing.
"
"Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
[p]Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
"
"If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
[p]Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
[p]Give me a case to put my visage in:
[p]A visor for a visor! what care I
[p]What curious eye doth quote deformities?
[p]Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
"
"Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
[p]But every man betake him to his legs.
"
"A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
[p]Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
[p]For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
[p]I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
[p]The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
"
"Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
[p]If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
[p]Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
[p]Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
"
"Nay, that's not so.
"
"I mean, sir, in delay
[p]We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
[p]Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
[p]Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
"
"And we mean well in going to this mask;
[p]But 'tis no wit to go.
"
"Why, may one ask?
"
"I dream'd a dream to-night.
"
"And so did I.
"
"Well, what was yours?
"
"That dreamers often lie.
"
"In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
"
"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
[p]She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
[p]In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
[p]On the fore-finger of an alderman,
[p]Drawn with a team of little atomies
[p]Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
[p]Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
[p]The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
[p]The traces of the smallest spider's web,
[p]The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
[p]Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
[p]Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
[p]Not so big as a round little worm
[p]Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
[p]Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
[p]Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
[p]Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
[p]And in this state she gallops night by night
[p]Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
[p]O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
[p]O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
[p]O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
[p]Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
[p]Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
[p]Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
[p]And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
[p]And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
[p]Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
[p]Then dreams, he of another benefice:
[p]Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
[p]And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
[p]Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
[p]Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
[p]Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
[p]And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
[p]And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
[p]That plats the manes of horses in the night,
[p]And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
[p]Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
[p]This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
[p]That presses them and learns them first to bear,
[p]Making them women of good carriage:
[p]This is she--
"
"Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
[p]Thou talk'st of nothing.
"
"True, I talk of dreams,
[p]Which are the children of an idle brain,
[p]Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
[p]Which is as thin of substance as the air
[p]And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
[p]Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
[p]And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
[p]Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
"
"This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
[p]Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
"
"I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
[p]Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
[p]Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
[p]With this night's revels and expire the term
[p]Of a despised life closed in my breast
[p]By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
[p]But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
[p]Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
"
"Strike, drum.
"
"Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
[p]shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
"
"When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
[p]hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
"
"Away with the joint-stools, remove the
[p]court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
[p]me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
[p]the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
[p]Antony, and Potpan!
"
"Ay, boy, ready.
"
"You are looked for and called for, asked for and
[p]sought for, in the great chamber.
"
"We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
[p]brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
"
"Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
[p]Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
[p]Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
[p]Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
[p]She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
[p]Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
[p]That I have worn a visor and could tell
[p]A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
[p]Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
[p]You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
[p]A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
[p][Music plays, and they dance]
[p]More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
[p]And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
[p]Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
[p]Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
[p]For you and I are past our dancing days:
[p]How long is't now since last yourself and I
[p]Were in a mask?
"
"By'r lady, thirty years.
"
"What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
[p]'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
[p]Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
[p]Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
"
"'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
[p]His son is thirty.
"
"Will you tell me that?
[p]His son was but a ward two years ago.
"
"[To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
[p]enrich the hand
[p]Of yonder knight?
"
"I know not, sir.
"
"O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
[p]It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
[p]Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
[p]Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
[p]So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
[p]As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
[p]The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
[p]And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
[p]Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
[p]For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
"
"This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
[p]Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
[p]Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
[p]To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
[p]Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
[p]To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
"
"Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
"
"Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
[p]A villain that is hither come in spite,
[p]To scorn at our solemnity this night.
"
"Young Romeo is it?
"
"'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
"
"Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
[p]He bears him like a portly gentleman;
[p]And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
[p]To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
[p]I would not for the wealth of all the town
[p]Here in my house do him disparagement:
[p]Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
[p]It is my will, the which if thou respect,
[p]Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
[p]And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
"
"It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
[p]I'll not endure him.
"
"He shall be endured:
[p]What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
[p]Am I the master here, or you? go to.
[p]You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
[p]You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
[p]You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
"
"Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
"
"Go to, go to;
[p]You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
[p]This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
[p]You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
[p]Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
[p]Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
[p]I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
"
"Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
[p]Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
[p]I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
[p]Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
"
"[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
[p]This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
[p]My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
[p]To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
"
"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
[p]Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
[p]For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
[p]And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
"
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
"
"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
"
"O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
[p]They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
"
"Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
"
"Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
[p]Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
"
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
"
"Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
[p]Give me my sin again.
"
"You kiss by the book.
"
"Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
"
"What is her mother?
"
"Marry, bachelor,
[p]Her mother is the lady of the house,
[p]And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
[p]I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
[p]I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
[p]Shall have the chinks.
"
"Is she a Capulet?
[p]O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
"
"Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
"
"Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
"
"Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
[p]We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
[p]Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
[p]I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
[p]More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
[p]Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
[p]I'll to my rest.
"
"Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
"
"The son and heir of old Tiberio.
"
"What's he that now is going out of door?
"
"Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
"
"What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
"
"I know not.
"
"Go ask his name: if he be married.
[p]My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
"
"His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
[p]The only son of your great enemy.
"
"My only love sprung from my only hate!
[p]Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
[p]Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
[p]That I must love a loathed enemy.
"
"What's this? what's this?
"
"A rhyme I learn'd even now
[p]Of one I danced withal.
"
"Anon, anon!
[p]Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
"
"Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
[p]And young affection gapes to be his heir;
[p]That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
[p]With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
[p]Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
[p]Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
[p]But to his foe supposed he must complain,
[p]And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
[p]Being held a foe, he may not have access
[p]To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
[p]And she as much in love, her means much less
[p]To meet her new-beloved any where:
[p]But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
[p]Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
"
"Can I go forward when my heart is here?
[p]Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
"
"Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
"
"He is wise;
[p]And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
"
"He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
[p]Call, good Mercutio.
"
"Nay, I'll conjure too.
[p]Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
[p]Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
[p]Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
[p]Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
[p]Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
[p]One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
[p]Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
[p]When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
[p]He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
[p]The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
[p]I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
[p]By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
[p]By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
[p]And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
[p]That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
"
"And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
"
"This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
[p]To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
[p]Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
[p]Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
[p]That were some spite: my invocation
[p]Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
[p]I conjure only but to raise up him.
"
"Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
[p]To be consorted with the humorous night:
[p]Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
"
"If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
[p]Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
[p]And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
[p]As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
[p]Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
[p]An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
[p]Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
[p]This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
[p]Come, shall we go?
"
"Go, then; for 'tis in vain
[p]To seek him here that means not to be found.
"
"He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
[p][JULIET appears above at a window]
[p]But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
[p]It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
[p]Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
[p]Who is already sick and pale with grief,
[p]That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
[p]Be not her maid, since she is envious;
[p]Her vestal livery is but sick and green
[p]And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
[p]It is my lady, O, it is my love!
[p]O, that she knew she were!
[p]She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
[p]Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
[p]I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
[p]Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
[p]Having some business, do entreat her eyes
[p]To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
[p]What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
[p]The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
[p]As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
[p]Would through the airy region stream so bright
[p]That birds would sing and think it were not night.
[p]See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
[p]O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
[p]That I might touch that cheek!
"
"Ay me!
"
"She speaks:
[p]O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
[p]As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
[p]As is a winged messenger of heaven
[p]Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
[p]Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
[p]When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
[p]And sails upon the bosom of the air.
"
"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
[p]Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
[p]Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
[p]And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
"
"[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
"
"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
[p]Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
[p]What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
[p]Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
[p]Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
[p]What's in a name? that which we call a rose
[p]By any other name would smell as sweet;
[p]So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
[p]Retain that dear perfection which he owes
[p]Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
[p]And for that name which is no part of thee
[p]Take all myself.
"
"I take thee at thy word:
[p]Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
[p]Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
"
"What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
[p]So stumblest on my counsel?
"
"By a name
[p]I know not how to tell thee who I am:
[p]My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
[p]Because it is an enemy to thee;
[p]Had I it written, I would tear the word.
"
"My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
[p]Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
[p]Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
"
"Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
"
"How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
[p]The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
[p]And the place death, considering who thou art,
[p]If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
"
"With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
[p]For stony limits cannot hold love out,
[p]And what love can do that dares love attempt;
[p]Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
"
"If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
"
"Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
[p]Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
[p]And I am proof against their enmity.
"
"I would not for the world they saw thee here.
"
"I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
[p]And but thou love me, let them find me here:
[p]My life were better ended by their hate,
[p]Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
"
"By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
"
"By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
[p]He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
[p]I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
[p]As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
[p]I would adventure for such merchandise.
"
"Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
[p]Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
[p]For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
[p]Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
[p]What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
[p]Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
[p]And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
[p]Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
[p]Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
[p]If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
[p]Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
[p]I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
[p]So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
[p]In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
[p]And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
[p]But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
[p]Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
[p]I should have been more strange, I must confess,
[p]But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
[p]My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
[p]And not impute this yielding to light love,
[p]Which the dark night hath so discovered.
"
"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
[p]That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
"
"O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
[p]That monthly changes in her circled orb,
[p]Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
"
"What shall I swear by?
"
"Do not swear at all;
[p]Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
[p]Which is the god of my idolatry,
[p]And I'll believe thee.
"
"If my heart's dear love--
"
"Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
[p]I have no joy of this contract to-night:
[p]It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
[p]Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
[p]Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
[p]This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
[p]May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
[p]Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
[p]Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
"
"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
"
"What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
"
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
"
"I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
[p]And yet I would it were to give again.
"
"Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
"
"But to be frank, and give it thee again.
[p]And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
[p]My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
[p]My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
[p]The more I have, for both are infinite.
[p][Nurse calls within]
[p]I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
[p]Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
[p]Stay but a little, I will come again.
"
"O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
[p]Being in night, all this is but a dream,
[p]Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
"
"Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
[p]If that thy bent of love be honourable,
[p]Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
[p]By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
[p]Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
[p]And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
[p]And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
"
"[Within] Madam!
"
"I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
[p]I do beseech thee--
"
"[Within] Madam!
"
"By and by, I come:--
[p]To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
[p]To-morrow will I send.
"
"So thrive my soul--
"
"A thousand times good night!
"
"A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
[p]Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
[p]their books,
[p]But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
"
"Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
[p]To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
[p]Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
[p]Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
[p]And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
[p]With repetition of my Romeo's name.
"
"It is my soul that calls upon my name:
[p]How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
[p]Like softest music to attending ears!
"
"Romeo!
"
"My dear?
"
"At what o'clock to-morrow
[p]Shall I send to thee?
"
"At the hour of nine.
"
"I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
[p]I have forgot why I did call thee back.
"
"Let me stand here till thou remember it.
"
"I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
[p]Remembering how I love thy company.
"
"And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
[p]Forgetting any other home but this.
"
"'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
[p]And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
[p]Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
[p]Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
[p]And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
[p]So loving-jealous of his liberty.
"
"I would I were thy bird.
"
"Sweet, so would I:
[p]Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
[p]Good night, good night! parting is such
[p]sweet sorrow,
[p]That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
"
"Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
[p]Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
[p]Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
[p]His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
"
"The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
[p]Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
[p]And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
[p]From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
[p]Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
[p]The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
[p]I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
[p]With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
[p]The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
[p]What is her burying grave that is her womb,
[p]And from her womb children of divers kind
[p]We sucking on her natural bosom find,
[p]Many for many virtues excellent,
[p]None but for some and yet all different.
[p]O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
[p]In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
[p]For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
[p]But to the earth some special good doth give,
[p]Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
[p]Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
[p]Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
[p]And vice sometimes by action dignified.
[p]Within the infant rind of this small flower
[p]Poison hath residence and medicine power:
[p]For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
[p]Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
[p]Two such opposed kings encamp them still
[p]In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
[p]And where the worser is predominant,
[p]Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
"
"Good morrow, father.
"
"Benedicite!
[p]What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
[p]Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
[p]So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
[p]Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
[p]And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
[p]But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
[p]Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
[p]Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
[p]Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
[p]Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
[p]Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
"
"That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
"
"God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
"
"With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
[p]I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
"
"That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
"
"I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
[p]I have been feasting with mine enemy,
[p]Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
[p]That's by me wounded: both our remedies
[p]Within thy help and holy physic lies:
[p]I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
[p]My intercession likewise steads my foe.
"
"Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
[p]Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
"
"Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
[p]On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
[p]As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
[p]And all combined, save what thou must combine
[p]By holy marriage: when and where and how
[p]We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
[p]I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
[p]That thou consent to marry us to-day.
"
"Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
[p]Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
[p]So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
[p]Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
[p]Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
[p]Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
[p]How much salt water thrown away in waste,
[p]To season love, that of it doth not taste!
[p]The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
[p]Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
[p]Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
[p]Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
[p]If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
[p]Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
[p]And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
[p]Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
"
"Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
"
"For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
"
"And bad'st me bury love.
"
"Not in a grave,
[p]To lay one in, another out to have.
"
"I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
[p]Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
[p]The other did not so.
"
"O, she knew well
[p]Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
[p]But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
[p]In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
[p]For this alliance may so happy prove,
[p]To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
"
"O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
"
"Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
"
"Where the devil should this Romeo be?
[p]Came he not home to-night?
"
"Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
"
"Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
[p]Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
"
"Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
[p]Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
"
"A challenge, on my life.
"
"Romeo will answer it.
"
"Any man that can write may answer a letter.
"
"Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
[p]dares, being dared.
"
"Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
[p]white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
[p]love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
[p]blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
[p]encounter Tybalt?
"
"Why, what is Tybalt?
"
"More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
[p]the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
[p]you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
[p]proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
[p]the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
[p]button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
[p]very first house, of the first and second cause:
[p]ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
[p]hai!
"
"The what?
"
"The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
[p]fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
[p]a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
[p]whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
[p]grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
[p]these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
[p]perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
[p]that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
[p]bones, their bones!
"
"Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
"
"Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
[p]how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
[p]that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
[p]kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
[p]be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
[p]Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
[p]eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
[p]Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
[p]to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
[p]fairly last night.
"
"Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
"
"The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
"
"Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
[p]such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
"
"That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
[p]constrains a man to bow in the hams.
"
"Meaning, to court'sy.
"
"Thou hast most kindly hit it.
"
"A most courteous exposition.
"
"Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
"
"Pink for flower.
"
"Right.
"
"Why, then is my pump well flowered.
"
"Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
[p]worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
[p]is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
"
"O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
[p]singleness.
"
"Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
"
"Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
"
"Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
[p]done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
[p]thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
[p]was I with you there for the goose?
"
"Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
[p]not there for the goose.
"
"I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
"
"Nay, good goose, bite not.
"
"Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
[p]sharp sauce.
"
"And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
"
"O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
[p]inch narrow to an ell broad!
"
"I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
[p]to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
"
"Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
[p]now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
[p]thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
[p]for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
[p]that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
"
"Stop there, stop there.
"
"Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
"
"Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
"
"O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
[p]for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
[p]meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
"
"Here's goodly gear!
"
"A sail, a sail!
"
"Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
"
"Peter!
"
"Anon!
"
"My fan, Peter.
"
"Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
[p]fairer face.
"
"God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
"
"God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
"
"Is it good den?
"
"'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
[p]dial is now upon the prick of noon.
"
"Out upon you! what a man are you!
"
"One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
[p]mar.
"
"By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
[p]quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
[p]may find the young Romeo?
"
"I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
[p]you have found him than he was when you sought him:
[p]I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
"
"You say well.
"
"Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
[p]wisely, wisely.
"
"if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
[p]you.
"
"She will indite him to some supper.
"
"A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
"
"What hast thou found?
"
"No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
[p]that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
[p][Sings]
[p]An old hare hoar,
[p]And an old hare hoar,
[p]Is very good meat in lent
[p]But a hare that is hoar
[p]Is too much for a score,
[p]When it hoars ere it be spent.
[p]Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
[p]to dinner, thither.
"
"I will follow you.
"
"Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
[p][Singing]
[p]'lady, lady, lady.'
"
"Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
[p]merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
"
"A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
[p]and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
[p]to in a month.
"
"An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
[p]down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
[p]Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
[p]Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
[p]none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
[p]too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
"
"I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
[p]should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
[p]draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
[p]good quarrel, and the law on my side.
"
"Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
[p]me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
[p]and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
[p]out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
[p]but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
[p]a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
[p]kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
[p]is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
[p]with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
[p]to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
"
"Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
[p]protest unto thee--
"
"Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
[p]Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
"
"What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
"
"I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
[p]I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
"
"Bid her devise
[p]Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
[p]And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
[p]Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
"
"No truly sir; not a penny.
"
"Go to; I say you shall.
"
"This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
"
"And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
[p]Within this hour my man shall be with thee
[p]And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
[p]Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
[p]Must be my convoy in the secret night.
[p]Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
[p]Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
"
"Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
"
"What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
"
"Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
[p]Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
"
"I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
"
"Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
[p]Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
[p]is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
[p]lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
[p]see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
[p]sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
[p]man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
[p]as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
[p]rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
"
"Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
"
"Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
[p]the--No; I know it begins with some other
[p]letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
[p]it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
[p]to hear it.
"
"Commend me to thy lady.
"
"Ay, a thousand times.
[p][Exit Romeo]
[p]Peter!
"
"Anon!
"
"Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
"
"The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
[p]In half an hour she promised to return.
[p]Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
[p]O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
[p]Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
[p]Driving back shadows over louring hills:
[p]Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
[p]And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
[p]Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
[p]Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
[p]Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
[p]Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
[p]She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
[p]My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
[p]And his to me:
[p]But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
[p]Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
[p]O God, she comes!
[p][Enter Nurse and PETER]
[p]O honey nurse, what news?
[p]Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
"
"Peter, stay at the gate.
"
"Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
[p]Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
[p]If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
[p]By playing it to me with so sour a face.
"
"I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
[p]Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
"
"I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
[p]Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
"
"Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
[p]Do you not see that I am out of breath?
"
"How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
[p]To say to me that thou art out of breath?
[p]The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
[p]Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
[p]Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
[p]Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
[p]Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
"
"Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
[p]how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
[p]face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
[p]all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
[p]though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
[p]past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
[p]but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
[p]ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
"
"No, no: but all this did I know before.
[p]What says he of our marriage? what of that?
"
"Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
[p]It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
[p]My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
[p]Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
[p]To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
"
"I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
[p]Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
"
"Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
[p]courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
[p]warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
"
"Where is my mother! why, she is within;
[p]Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
[p]'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
[p]Where is your mother?'
"
"O God's lady dear!
[p]Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
[p]Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
[p]Henceforward do your messages yourself.
"
"Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
"
"Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
"
"I have.
"
"Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
[p]There stays a husband to make you a wife:
[p]Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
[p]They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
[p]Hie you to church; I must another way,
[p]To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
[p]Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
[p]I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
[p]But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
[p]Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
"
"Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
"
"So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
[p]That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
"
"Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
[p]It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
[p]That one short minute gives me in her sight:
[p]Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
[p]Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
[p]It is enough I may but call her mine.
"
"These violent delights have violent ends
[p]And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
[p]Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
[p]Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
[p]And in the taste confounds the appetite:
[p]Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
[p]Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
[p][Enter JULIET]
[p]Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
[p]Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
[p]A lover may bestride the gossamer
[p]That idles in the wanton summer air,
[p]And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
"
"Good even to my ghostly confessor.
"
"Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
"
"As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
"
"Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
[p]Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
[p]To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
[p]This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
[p]Unfold the imagined happiness that both
[p]Receive in either by this dear encounter.
"
"Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
[p]Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
[p]They are but beggars that can count their worth;
[p]But my true love is grown to such excess
[p]I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
"
"Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
[p]For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
[p]Till holy church incorporate two in one.
"
"I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
[p]The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
[p]And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
[p]For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
"
"Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
[p]enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
[p]upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
[p]thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
[p]it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
"
"Am I like such a fellow?
"
"Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
[p]any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
[p]soon moody to be moved.
"
"And what to?
"
"Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
[p]shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
[p]thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
[p]or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
[p]wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
[p]other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
[p]eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
[p]Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
[p]meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
[p]an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
[p]man for coughing in the street, because he hath
[p]wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
[p]didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
[p]his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
[p]tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
[p]wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
"
"An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
[p]should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
"
"The fee-simple! O simple!
"
"By my head, here come the Capulets.
"
"By my heel, I care not.
"
"Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
[p]Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
"
"And but one word with one of us? couple it with
[p]something; make it a word and a blow.
"
"You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
[p]will give me occasion.
"
"Could you not take some occasion without giving?
"
"Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
"
"Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
[p]thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
[p]discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
[p]make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
"
"We talk here in the public haunt of men:
[p]Either withdraw unto some private place,
[p]And reason coldly of your grievances,
[p]Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
"
"Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
[p]I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
"
"Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
"
"But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
[p]Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
[p]Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
"
"Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
[p]No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
"
"Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
[p]Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
[p]To such a greeting: villain am I none;
[p]Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
"
"Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
[p]That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
"
"I do protest, I never injured thee,
[p]But love thee better than thou canst devise,
[p]Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
[p]And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
[p]As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
"
"O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
[p]Alla stoccata carries it away.
[p][Draws]
[p]Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
"
"What wouldst thou have with me?
"
"Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
[p]lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
[p]shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
[p]eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
[p]by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
[p]ears ere it be out.
"
"I am for you.
"
"Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
"
"Come, sir, your passado.
"
"Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
[p]Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
[p]Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
[p]Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
[p]Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
"
"I am hurt.
[p]A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
[p]Is he gone, and hath nothing?
"
"What, art thou hurt?
"
"Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
[p]Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
"
"Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
"
"No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
[p]church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
[p]me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
[p]am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
[p]both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
[p]cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
[p]rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
[p]arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
[p]was hurt under your arm.
"
"I thought all for the best.
"
"Help me into some house, Benvolio,
[p]Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
[p]They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
[p]And soundly too: your houses!
"
"This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
[p]My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
[p]In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
[p]With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
[p]Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
[p]Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
[p]And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
"
"O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
[p]That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
[p]Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
"
"This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
[p]This but begins the woe, others must end.
"
"Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
"
"Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
[p]Away to heaven, respective lenity,
[p]And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
[p][Re-enter TYBALT]
[p]Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
[p]That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
[p]Is but a little way above our heads,
[p]Staying for thine to keep him company:
[p]Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
"
"Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
[p]Shalt with him hence.
"
"This shall determine that.
"
"Romeo, away, be gone!
[p]The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
[p]Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
[p]If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
"
"O, I am fortune's fool!
"
"Why dost thou stay?
"
"Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
[p]Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
"
"There lies that Tybalt.
"
"Up, sir, go with me;
[p]I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
[p][Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their]
[p]Wives, and others]
"
"Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
"
"O noble prince, I can discover all
[p]The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
[p]There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
[p]That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
"
"Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
[p]O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
[p]O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
[p]For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
[p]O cousin, cousin!
"
"Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
"
"Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
[p]Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
[p]How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
[p]Your high displeasure: all this uttered
[p]With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
[p]Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
[p]Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
[p]With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
[p]Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
[p]And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
[p]Cold death aside, and with the other sends
[p]It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
[p]Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
[p]'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
[p]his tongue,
[p]His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
[p]And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
[p]An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
[p]Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
[p]But by and by comes back to Romeo,
[p]Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
[p]And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
[p]Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
[p]And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
[p]This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
"
"He is a kinsman to the Montague;
[p]Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
[p]Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
[p]And all those twenty could but kill one life.
[p]I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
[p]Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
"
"Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
[p]Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
"
"Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
[p]His fault concludes but what the law should end,
[p]The life of Tybalt.
"
"And for that offence
[p]Immediately we do exile him hence:
[p]I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
[p]My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
[p]But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
[p]That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
[p]I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
[p]Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
[p]Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
[p]Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
[p]Bear hence this body and attend our will:
[p]Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
"
"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
[p]Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
[p]As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
[p]And bring in cloudy night immediately.
[p]Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
[p]That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
[p]Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
[p]Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
[p]By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
[p]It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
[p]Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
[p]And learn me how to lose a winning match,
[p]Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
[p]Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
[p]With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
[p]Think true love acted simple modesty.
[p]Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
[p]For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
[p]Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
[p]Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
[p]Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
[p]Take him and cut him out in little stars,
[p]And he will make the face of heaven so fine
[p]That all the world will be in love with night
[p]And pay no worship to the garish sun.
[p]O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
[p]But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
[p]Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
[p]As is the night before some festival
[p]To an impatient child that hath new robes
[p]And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
[p]And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
[p]But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
[p][Enter Nurse, with cords]
[p]Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
[p]That Romeo bid thee fetch?
"
"Ay, ay, the cords.
"
"Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
"
"Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
[p]We are undone, lady, we are undone!
[p]Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
"
"Can heaven be so envious?
"
"Romeo can,
[p]Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
[p]Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
"
"What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
[p]This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
[p]Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
[p]And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
[p]Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
[p]I am not I, if there be such an I;
[p]Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
[p]If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
[p]Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
"
"I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
[p]God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
[p]A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
[p]Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
[p]All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
"
"O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
[p]To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
[p]Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
[p]And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
"
"O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
[p]O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
[p]That ever I should live to see thee dead!
"
"What storm is this that blows so contrary?
[p]Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
[p]My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
[p]Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
[p]For who is living, if those two are gone?
"
"Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
[p]Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
"
"O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
"
"It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
"
"O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
[p]Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
[p]Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
[p]Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
[p]Despised substance of divinest show!
[p]Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
[p]A damned saint, an honourable villain!
[p]O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
[p]When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
[p]In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
[p]Was ever book containing such vile matter
[p]So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
[p]In such a gorgeous palace!
"
"There's no trust,
[p]No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
[p]All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
[p]Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
[p]These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
[p]Shame come to Romeo!
"
"Blister'd be thy tongue
[p]For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
[p]Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
[p]For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
[p]Sole monarch of the universal earth.
[p]O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
"
"Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
"
"Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
[p]Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
[p]When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
[p]But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
[p]That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
[p]Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
[p]Your tributary drops belong to woe,
[p]Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
[p]My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
[p]And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
[p]All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
[p]Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
[p]That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
[p]But, O, it presses to my memory,
[p]Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
[p]'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
[p]That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
[p]Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
[p]Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
[p]Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
[p]And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
[p]Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
[p]Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
[p]Which modern lamentations might have moved?
[p]But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
[p]'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
[p]Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
[p]All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
[p]There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
[p]In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
[p]Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
"
"Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
[p]Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
"
"Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
[p]When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
[p]Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
[p]Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
[p]He made you for a highway to my bed;
[p]But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
[p]Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
[p]And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
"
"Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
[p]To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
[p]Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
[p]I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
"
"O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
[p]And bid him come to take his last farewell.
"
"Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
[p]Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
[p]And thou art wedded to calamity.
"
"Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
[p]What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
[p]That I yet know not?
"
"Too familiar
[p]Is my dear son with such sour company:
[p]I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
"
"What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
"
"A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
[p]Not body's death, but body's banishment.
"
"Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
[p]For exile hath more terror in his look,
[p]Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
"
"Hence from Verona art thou banished:
[p]Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
"
"There is no world without Verona walls,
[p]But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
[p]Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
[p]And world's exile is death: then banished,
[p]Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
[p]Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
[p]And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
"
"O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
[p]Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
[p]Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
[p]And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
[p]This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
"
"'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
[p]Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
[p]And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
[p]Live here in heaven and may look on her;
[p]But Romeo may not: more validity,
[p]More honourable state, more courtship lives
[p]In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
[p]On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
[p]And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
[p]Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
[p]Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
[p]But Romeo may not; he is banished:
[p]Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
[p]They are free men, but I am banished.
[p]And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
[p]Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
[p]No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
[p]But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
[p]O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
[p]Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
[p]Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
[p]A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
[p]To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
"
"Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
"
"O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
"
"I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
[p]Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
[p]To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
"
"Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
[p]Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
[p]Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
[p]It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
"
"O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
"
"How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
"
"Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
"
"Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
[p]Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
[p]An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
[p]Doting like me and like me banished,
[p]Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
[p]And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
[p]Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
"
"Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
"
"Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
[p]Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
"
"Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
[p]Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
[p][Knocking]
[p]Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
[p]What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
[p][Knocking]
[p]Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
"
"[Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
[p]my errand;
[p]I come from Lady Juliet.
"
"Welcome, then.
"
"O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
[p]Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
"
"There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
"
"O, he is even in my mistress' case,
[p]Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
[p]Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
[p]Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
[p]Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
[p]For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
[p]Why should you fall into so deep an O?
"
"Nurse!
"
"Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
"
"Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
[p]Doth she not think me an old murderer,
[p]Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
[p]With blood removed but little from her own?
[p]Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
[p]My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
"
"O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
[p]And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
[p]And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
[p]And then down falls again.
"
"As if that name,
[p]Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
[p]Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
[p]Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
[p]In what vile part of this anatomy
[p]Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
[p]The hateful mansion.
"
"Hold thy desperate hand:
[p]Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
[p]Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
[p]The unreasonable fury of a beast:
[p]Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
[p]Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
[p]Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
[p]I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
[p]Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
[p]And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
[p]By doing damned hate upon thyself?
[p]Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
[p]Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
[p]In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
[p]Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
[p]Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
[p]And usest none in that true use indeed
[p]Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
[p]Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
[p]Digressing from the valour of a man;
[p]Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
[p]Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
[p]Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
[p]Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
[p]Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
[p]Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
[p]And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
[p]What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
[p]For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
[p]There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
[p]But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
[p]The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
[p]And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
[p]A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
[p]Happiness courts thee in her best array;
[p]But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
[p]Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
[p]Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
[p]Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
[p]Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
[p]But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
[p]For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
[p]Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
[p]To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
[p]Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
[p]With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
[p]Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
[p]Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
[p]And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
[p]Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
[p]Romeo is coming.
"
"O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
[p]To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
[p]My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
"
"Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
"
"Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
[p]Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
"
"How well my comfort is revived by this!
"
"Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
[p]Either be gone before the watch be set,
[p]Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
[p]Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
[p]And he shall signify from time to time
[p]Every good hap to you that chances here:
[p]Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
"
"But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
[p]It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
"
"Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
[p]That we have had no time to move our daughter:
[p]Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
[p]And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
[p]'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
[p]I promise you, but for your company,
[p]I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
"
"These times of woe afford no time to woo.
[p]Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
"
"I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
[p]To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
"
"Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
[p]Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
[p]In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
[p]Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
[p]Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
[p]And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
[p]But, soft! what day is this?
"
"Monday, my lord,
"
"Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
[p]O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
[p]She shall be married to this noble earl.
[p]Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
[p]We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
[p]For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
[p]It may be thought we held him carelessly,
[p]Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
[p]Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
[p]And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
"
"My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
"
"Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
[p]Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
[p]Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
[p]Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
[p]Afore me! it is so very very late,
[p]That we may call it early by and by.
[p]Good night.
"
"Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
[p]It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
[p]That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
[p]Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
[p]Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
"
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
[p]No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
[p]Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
[p]Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
[p]Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
[p]I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
"
"Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
[p]It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
[p]To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
[p]And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
[p]Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
"
"Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
[p]I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
[p]I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
[p]'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
[p]Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
[p]The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
[p]I have more care to stay than will to go:
[p]Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
[p]How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
"
"It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
[p]It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
[p]Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
[p]Some say the lark makes sweet division;
[p]This doth not so, for she divideth us:
[p]Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
[p]O, now I would they had changed voices too!
[p]Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
[p]Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
[p]O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
"
"More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
"
"Madam!
"
"Nurse?
"
"Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
[p]The day is broke; be wary, look about.
"
"Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
"
"Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
"
"Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
[p]I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
[p]For in a minute there are many days:
[p]O, by this count I shall be much in years
[p]Ere I again behold my Romeo!
"
"Farewell!
[p]I will omit no opportunity
[p]That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
"
"O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
"
"I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
[p]For sweet discourses in our time to come.
"
"O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
[p]Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
[p]As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
[p]Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
"
"And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
[p]Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
"
"O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
[p]If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
[p]That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
[p]For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
[p]But send him back.
"
"[Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
"
"Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
[p]Is she not down so late, or up so early?
[p]What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
"
"Why, how now, Juliet!
"
"Madam, I am not well.
"
"Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
[p]What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
[p]An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
[p]Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
[p]But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
"
"Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
"
"So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
[p]Which you weep for.
"
"Feeling so the loss,
[p]Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
"
"Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
[p]As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
"
"What villain madam?
"
"That same villain, Romeo.
"
"[Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
[p]God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
[p]And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
"
"That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
"
"Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
[p]Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
"
"We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
[p]Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
[p]Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
[p]Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
[p]That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
[p]And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
"
"Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
[p]With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
[p]Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
[p]Madam, if you could find out but a man
[p]To bear a poison, I would temper it;
[p]That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
[p]Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
[p]To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
[p]To wreak the love I bore my cousin
[p]Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
"
"Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
[p]But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
"
"And joy comes well in such a needy time:
[p]What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
"
"Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
[p]One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
[p]Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
[p]That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
"
"Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
"
"Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
[p]The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
[p]The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
[p]Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
"
"Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
[p]He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
[p]I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
[p]Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
[p]I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
[p]I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
[p]It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
[p]Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
"
"Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
[p]And see how he will take it at your hands.
"
"When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
[p]But for the sunset of my brother's son
[p]It rains downright.
[p]How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
[p]Evermore showering? In one little body
[p]Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
[p]For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
[p]Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
[p]Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
[p]Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
[p]Without a sudden calm, will overset
[p]Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
[p]Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
"
"Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
[p]I would the fool were married to her grave!
"
"Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
[p]How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
[p]Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
[p]Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
[p]So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
"
"Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
[p]Proud can I never be of what I hate;
[p]But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
"
"How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
[p]'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
[p]And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
[p]Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
[p]But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
[p]To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
[p]Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
[p]Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
[p]You tallow-face!
"
"Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
"
"Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
[p]Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
"
"Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
[p]I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
[p]Or never after look me in the face:
[p]Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
[p]My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
[p]That God had lent us but this only child;
[p]But now I see this one is one too much,
[p]And that we have a curse in having her:
[p]Out on her, hilding!
"
"God in heaven bless her!
[p]You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
"
"And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
[p]Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
"
"I speak no treason.
"
"O, God ye god-den.
"
"May not one speak?
"
"Peace, you mumbling fool!
[p]Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
[p]For here we need it not.
"
"You are too hot.
"
"God's bread! it makes me mad:
[p]Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
[p]Alone, in company, still my care hath been
[p]To have her match'd: and having now provided
[p]A gentleman of noble parentage,
[p]Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
[p]Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
[p]Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
[p]And then to have a wretched puling fool,
[p]A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
[p]To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
[p]I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
[p]But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
[p]Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
[p]Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
[p]Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
[p]An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
[p]And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
[p]the streets,
[p]For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
[p]Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
[p]Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
"
"Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
[p]That sees into the bottom of my grief?
[p]O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
[p]Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
[p]Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
[p]In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
"
"Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
[p]Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
"
"O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
[p]My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
[p]How shall that faith return again to earth,
[p]Unless that husband send it me from heaven
[p]By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
[p]Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
[p]Upon so soft a subject as myself!
[p]What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
[p]Some comfort, nurse.
"
"Faith, here it is.
[p]Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
[p]That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
[p]Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
[p]Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
[p]I think it best you married with the county.
[p]O, he's a lovely gentleman!
[p]Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
[p]Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
[p]As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
[p]I think you are happy in this second match,
[p]For it excels your first: or if it did not,
[p]Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
[p]As living here and you no use of him.
"
"Speakest thou from thy heart?
"
"And from my soul too;
[p]Or else beshrew them both.
"
"Amen!
"
"What?
"
"Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
[p]Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
[p]Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
[p]To make confession and to be absolved.
"
"Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
"
"Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
[p]Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
[p]Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
[p]Which she hath praised him with above compare
[p]So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
[p]Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
[p]I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
[p]If all else fail, myself have power to die.
"
"On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
"
"My father Capulet will have it so;
[p]And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
"
"You say you do not know the lady's mind:
[p]Uneven is the course, I like it not.
"
"Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
[p]And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
[p]For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
[p]Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
[p]That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
[p]And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
[p]To stop the inundation of her tears;
[p]Which, too much minded by herself alone,
[p]May be put from her by society:
[p]Now do you know the reason of this haste.
"
"[Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
[p]Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
"
"Happily met, my lady and my wife!
"
"That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
"
"That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
"
"What must be shall be.
"
"That's a certain text.
"
"Come you to make confession to this father?
"
"To answer that, I should confess to you.
"
"Do not deny to him that you love me.
"
"I will confess to you that I love him.
"
"So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
"
"If I do so, it will be of more price,
[p]Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
"
"Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
"
"The tears have got small victory by that;
[p]For it was bad enough before their spite.
"
"Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
"
"That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
[p]And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
"
"Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
"
"It may be so, for it is not mine own.
[p]Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
[p]Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
"
"My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
[p]My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
"
"God shield I should disturb devotion!
[p]Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
[p]Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
"
"O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
[p]Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
"
"Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
[p]It strains me past the compass of my wits:
[p]I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
[p]On Thursday next be married to this county.
"
"Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
[p]Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
[p]If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
[p]Do thou but call my resolution wise,
[p]And with this knife I'll help it presently.
[p]God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
[p]And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
[p]Shall be the label to another deed,
[p]Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
[p]Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
[p]Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
[p]Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
[p]'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
[p]Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
[p]Which the commission of thy years and art
[p]Could to no issue of true honour bring.
[p]Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
[p]If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
"
"Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
[p]Which craves as desperate an execution.
[p]As that is desperate which we would prevent.
[p]If, rather than to marry County Paris,
[p]Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
[p]Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
[p]A thing like death to chide away this shame,
[p]That copest with death himself to scape from it:
[p]And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
"
"O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
[p]From off the battlements of yonder tower;
[p]Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
[p]Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
[p]Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
[p]O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
[p]With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
[p]Or bid me go into a new-made grave
[p]And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
[p]Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
[p]And I will do it without fear or doubt,
[p]To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
"
"Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
[p]To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
[p]To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
[p]Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
[p]Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
[p]And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
[p]When presently through all thy veins shall run
[p]A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
[p]Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
[p]No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
[p]The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
[p]To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
[p]Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
[p]Each part, deprived of supple government,
[p]Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
[p]And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
[p]Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
[p]And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
[p]Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
[p]To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
[p]Then, as the manner of our country is,
[p]In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
[p]Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
[p]Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
[p]In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
[p]Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
[p]And hither shall he come: and he and I
[p]Will watch thy waking, and that very night
[p]Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
[p]And this shall free thee from this present shame;
[p]If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
[p]Abate thy valour in the acting it.
"
"Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
"
"Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
[p]In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
[p]To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
"
"Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
[p]Farewell, dear father!
"
"So many guests invite as here are writ.
[p][Exit First Servant]
[p]Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
"
"You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
[p]can lick their fingers.
"
"How canst thou try them so?
"
"Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
[p]own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
[p]fingers goes not with me.
"
"Go, be gone.
[p][Exit Second Servant]
[p]We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
[p]What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
"
"Ay, forsooth.
"
"Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
[p]A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
"
"See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
"
"How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
"
"Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
[p]Of disobedient opposition
[p]To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
[p]By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
[p]And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
[p]Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
"
"Send for the county; go tell him of this:
[p]I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
"
"I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
[p]And gave him what becomed love I might,
[p]Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
"
"Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
[p]This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
[p]Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
[p]Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
[p]Our whole city is much bound to him.
"
"Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
[p]To help me sort such needful ornaments
[p]As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
"
"No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
"
"Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
"
"We shall be short in our provision:
[p]'Tis now near night.
"
"Tush, I will stir about,
[p]And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
[p]Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
[p]I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
[p]I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
[p]They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
[p]To County Paris, to prepare him up
[p]Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
[p]Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
"
"Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
[p]I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
[p]For I have need of many orisons
[p]To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
[p]Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
"
"What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
"
"No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
[p]As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
[p]So please you, let me now be left alone,
[p]And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
[p]For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
[p]In this so sudden business.
"
"Good night:
[p]Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
"
"Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
[p]I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
[p]That almost freezes up the heat of life:
[p]I'll call them back again to comfort me:
[p]Nurse! What should she do here?
[p]My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
[p]Come, vial.
[p]What if this mixture do not work at all?
[p]Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
[p]No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
[p][Laying down her dagger]
[p]What if it be a poison, which the friar
[p]Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
[p]Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
[p]Because he married me before to Romeo?
[p]I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
[p]For he hath still been tried a holy man.
[p]How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
[p]I wake before the time that Romeo
[p]Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
[p]Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
[p]To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
[p]And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
[p]Or, if I live, is it not very like,
[p]The horrible conceit of death and night,
[p]Together with the terror of the place,--
[p]As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
[p]Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
[p]Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
[p]Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
[p]Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
[p]At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
[p]Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
[p]So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
[p]And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
[p]That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
[p]O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
[p]Environed with all these hideous fears?
[p]And madly play with my forefather's joints?
[p]And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
[p]And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
[p]As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
[p]O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
[p]Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
[p]Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
[p]Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
"
"Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
"
"They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
"
"Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
[p]The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
[p]Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
[p]Spare not for the cost.
"
"Go, you cot-quean, go,
[p]Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
[p]For this night's watching.
"
"No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
[p]All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
"
"Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
[p]But I will watch you from such watching now.
"
"A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
"
"Now, fellow,
[p]What's there?
"
"Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
"
"Make haste, make haste.
[p][Exit First Servant]
[p]Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
[p]Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
"
"I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
[p]And never trouble Peter for the matter.
"
"Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
[p]Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
[p]The county will be here with music straight,
[p]For so he said he would: I hear him near.
[p][Music within]
[p]Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
[p][Re-enter Nurse]
[p]Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
[p]I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
[p]Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
[p]Make haste, I say.
"
"Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
[p]Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
[p]Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
[p]What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
[p]Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
[p]The County Paris hath set up his rest,
[p]That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
[p]Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
[p]I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
[p]Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
[p]He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
[p][Undraws the curtains]
[p]What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
[p]I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
[p]Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
[p]O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
[p]Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
"
"What noise is here?
"
"O lamentable day!
"
"What is the matter?
"
"Look, look! O heavy day!
"
"O me, O me! My child, my only life,
[p]Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
[p]Help, help! Call help.
"
"For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
"
"She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
"
"Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
"
"Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
[p]Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
[p]Life and these lips have long been separated:
[p]Death lies on her like an untimely frost
[p]Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
"
"O lamentable day!
"
"O woful time!
"
"Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
[p]Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
"
"Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
"
"Ready to go, but never to return.
[p]O son! the night before thy wedding-day
[p]Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
[p]Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
[p]Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
[p]My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
[p]And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
"
"Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
[p]And doth it give me such a sight as this?
"
"Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
[p]Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
[p]In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
[p]But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
[p]But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
[p]And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
"
"O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
[p]Most lamentable day, most woful day,
[p]That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
[p]O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
[p]Never was seen so black a day as this:
[p]O woful day, O woful day!
"
"Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
[p]Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
[p]By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
[p]O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
"
"Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
[p]Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
[p]To murder, murder our solemnity?
[p]O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
[p]Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
[p]And with my child my joys are buried.
"
"Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
[p]In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
[p]Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
[p]And all the better is it for the maid:
[p]Your part in her you could not keep from death,
[p]But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
[p]The most you sought was her promotion;
[p]For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
[p]And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
[p]Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
[p]O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
[p]That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
[p]She's not well married that lives married long;
[p]But she's best married that dies married young.
[p]Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
[p]On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
[p]In all her best array bear her to church:
[p]For though fond nature bids us an lament,
[p]Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
"
"All things that we ordained festival,
[p]Turn from their office to black funeral;
[p]Our instruments to melancholy bells,
[p]Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
[p]Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
[p]Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
[p]And all things change them to the contrary.
"
"Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
[p]And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
[p]To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
[p]The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
[p]Move them no more by crossing their high will.
"
"Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
"
"Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
[p]For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
"
"Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
"
"Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
[p]ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
"
"Why 'Heart's ease?'
"
"O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
[p]heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
[p]to comfort me.
"
"Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
"
"You will not, then?
"
"No.
"
"I will then give it you soundly.
"
"What will you give us?
"
"No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
[p]I will give you the minstrel.
"
"Then I will give you the serving-creature.
"
"Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
[p]your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
[p]I'll fa you; do you note me?
"
"An you re us and fa us, you note us.
"
"Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
"
"Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
[p]with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
[p]me like men:
[p]'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
[p]And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
[p]Then music with her silver sound'--
[p]why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
[p]sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
"
"Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
"
"Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
"
"I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
"
"Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
"
"Faith, I know not what to say.
"
"O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
[p]for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
[p]because musicians have no gold for sounding:
[p]'Then music with her silver sound
[p]With speedy help doth lend redress.'
"
"What a pestilent knave is this same!
"
"Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
[p]mourners, and stay dinner.
"
"If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
[p]My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
[p]My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
[p]And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
[p]Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
[p]I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
[p]Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
[p]to think!--
[p]And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
[p]That I revived, and was an emperor.
[p]Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
[p]When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
[p][Enter BALTHASAR, booted]
[p]News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
[p]Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
[p]How doth my lady? Is my father well?
[p]How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
[p]For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
"
"Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
[p]Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
[p]And her immortal part with angels lives.
[p]I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
[p]And presently took post to tell it you:
[p]O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
[p]Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
"
"Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
[p]Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
[p]And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
"
"I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
[p]Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
[p]Some misadventure.
"
"Tush, thou art deceived:
[p]Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
[p]Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
"
"No, my good lord.
"
"No matter: get thee gone,
[p]And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
[p][Exit BALTHASAR]
[p]Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
[p]Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
[p]To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
[p]I do remember an apothecary,--
[p]And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
[p]In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
[p]Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
[p]Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
[p]And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
[p]An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
[p]Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
[p]A beggarly account of empty boxes,
[p]Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
[p]Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
[p]Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
[p]Noting this penury, to myself I said
[p]'An if a man did need a poison now,
[p]Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
[p]Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
[p]O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
[p]And this same needy man must sell it me.
[p]As I remember, this should be the house.
[p]Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
[p]What, ho! apothecary!
"
"Who calls so loud?
"
"Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
[p]Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
[p]A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
[p]As will disperse itself through all the veins
[p]That the life-weary taker may fall dead
[p]And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
[p]As violently as hasty powder fired
[p]Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
"
"Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
[p]Is death to any he that utters them.
"
"Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
[p]And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
[p]Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
[p]Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
[p]The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
[p]The world affords no law to make thee rich;
[p]Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
"
"My poverty, but not my will, consents.
"
"I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
"
"Put this in any liquid thing you will,
[p]And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
[p]Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
"
"There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
[p]Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
[p]Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
[p]I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
[p]Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
[p]Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
[p]To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
"
"Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
"
"This same should be the voice of Friar John.
[p]Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
[p]Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
"
"Going to find a bare-foot brother out
[p]One of our order, to associate me,
[p]Here in this city visiting the sick,
[p]And finding him, the searchers of the town,
[p]Suspecting that we both were in a house
[p]Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
[p]Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
[p]So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
"
"Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
"
"I could not send it,--here it is again,--
[p]Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
[p]So fearful were they of infection.
"
"Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
[p]The letter was not nice but full of charge
[p]Of dear import, and the neglecting it
[p]May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
[p]Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
[p]Unto my cell.
"
"Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
"
"Now must I to the monument alone;
[p]Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
[p]She will beshrew me much that Romeo
[p]Hath had no notice of these accidents;
[p]But I will write again to Mantua,
[p]And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
[p]Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
"
"Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
[p]Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
[p]Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
[p]Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
[p]So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
[p]Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
[p]But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
[p]As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
[p]Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
"
"[Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
[p]Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
"
"Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
[p]O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
[p]Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
[p]Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
[p]The obsequies that I for thee will keep
[p]Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
[p][The Page whistles]
[p]The boy gives warning something doth approach.
[p]What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
[p]To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
[p]What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
"
"Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
[p]Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
[p]See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
[p]Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
[p]Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
[p]And do not interrupt me in my course.
[p]Why I descend into this bed of death,
[p]Is partly to behold my lady's face;
[p]But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
[p]A precious ring, a ring that I must use
[p]In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
[p]But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
[p]In what I further shall intend to do,
[p]By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
[p]And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
[p]The time and my intents are savage-wild,
[p]More fierce and more inexorable far
[p]Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
"
"I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
"
"So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
[p]Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
"
"[Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
[p]His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
"
"Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
[p]Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
[p]Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
[p]And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
"
"This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
[p]That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
[p]It is supposed, the fair creature died;
[p]And here is come to do some villanous shame
[p]To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
[p][Comes forward]
[p]Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
[p]Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
[p]Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
[p]Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
"
"I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
[p]Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
[p]Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
[p]Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
[p]Put not another sin upon my head,
[p]By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
[p]By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
[p]For I come hither arm'd against myself:
[p]Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
[p]A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
"
"I do defy thy conjurations,
[p]And apprehend thee for a felon here.
"
"Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
"
"O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
"
"O, I am slain!
[p][Falls]
[p]If thou be merciful,
[p]Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
"
"In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
[p]Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
[p]What said my man, when my betossed soul
[p]Did not attend him as we rode? I think
[p]He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
[p]Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
[p]Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
[p]To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
[p]One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
[p]I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
[p]A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
[p]For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
[p]This vault a feasting presence full of light.
[p]Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
[p][Laying PARIS in the tomb]
[p]How oft when men are at the point of death
[p]Have they been merry! which their keepers call
[p]A lightning before death: O, how may I
[p]Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
[p]Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
[p]Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
[p]Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
[p]Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
[p]And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
[p]Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
[p]O, what more favour can I do to thee,
[p]Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
[p]To sunder his that was thine enemy?
[p]Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
[p]Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
[p]That unsubstantial death is amorous,
[p]And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
[p]Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
[p]For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
[p]And never from this palace of dim night
[p]Depart again: here, here will I remain
[p]With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
[p]Will I set up my everlasting rest,
[p]And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
[p]From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
[p]Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
[p]The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
[p]A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
[p]Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
[p]Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
[p]The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
[p]Here's to my love!
[p][Drinks]
[p]O true apothecary!
[p]Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
[p][Dies]
[p][Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR]
[p]LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade]
"
"Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
[p]Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
"
"Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
"
"Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
[p]What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
[p]To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
[p]It burneth in the Capel's monument.
"
"It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
[p]One that you love.
"
"Who is it?
"
"Romeo.
"
"How long hath he been there?
"
"Full half an hour.
"
"Go with me to the vault.
"
"I dare not, sir
[p]My master knows not but I am gone hence;
[p]And fearfully did menace me with death,
[p]If I did stay to look on his intents.
"
"Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
[p]O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
"
"As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
[p]I dreamt my master and another fought,
[p]And that my master slew him.
"
"Romeo!
[p][Advances]
[p]Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
[p]The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
[p]What mean these masterless and gory swords
[p]To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
[p][Enters the tomb]
[p]Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
[p]And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
[p]Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
[p]The lady stirs.
"
"O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
[p]I do remember well where I should be,
[p]And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
"
"I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
[p]Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
[p]A greater power than we can contradict
[p]Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
[p]Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
[p]And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
[p]Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
[p]Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
[p]Come, go, good Juliet,
[p][Noise again]
[p]I dare no longer stay.
"
"Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
[p][Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]
[p]What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
[p]Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
[p]O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
[p]To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
[p]Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
[p]To make die with a restorative.
[p][Kisses him]
[p]Thy lips are warm.
"
"[Within] Lead, boy: which way?
"
"Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
[p][Snatching ROMEO's dagger]
[p]This is thy sheath;
[p][Stabs herself]
[p]there rust, and let me die.
"
"This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
"
"The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
[p]Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
[p]Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
[p]And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
[p]Who here hath lain these two days buried.
[p]Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
[p]Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
[p]We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
[p]But the true ground of all these piteous woes
[p]We cannot without circumstance descry.
"
"Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
"
"Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
"
"Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
[p]We took this mattock and this spade from him,
[p]As he was coming from this churchyard side.
"
"A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
"
"What misadventure is so early up,
[p]That calls our person from our morning's rest?
"
"What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
"
"The people in the street cry Romeo,
[p]Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
[p]With open outcry toward our monument.
"
"What fear is this which startles in our ears?
"
"Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
[p]And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
[p]Warm and new kill'd.
"
"Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
"
"Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
[p]With instruments upon them, fit to open
[p]These dead men's tombs.
"
"O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
[p]This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
[p]Is empty on the back of Montague,--
[p]And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
"
"O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
[p]That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
"
"Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
[p]To see thy son and heir more early down.
"
"Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
[p]Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
[p]What further woe conspires against mine age?
"
"Look, and thou shalt see.
"
"O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
[p]To press before thy father to a grave?
"
"Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
[p]Till we can clear these ambiguities,
[p]And know their spring, their head, their
[p]true descent;
[p]And then will I be general of your woes,
[p]And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
[p]And let mischance be slave to patience.
[p]Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
"
"I am the greatest, able to do least,
[p]Yet most suspected, as the time and place
[p]Doth make against me of this direful murder;
[p]And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
[p]Myself condemned and myself excused.
"
"Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
"
"I will be brief, for my short date of breath
[p]Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
[p]Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
[p]And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
[p]I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
[p]Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
[p]Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
[p]For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
[p]You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
[p]Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
[p]To County Paris: then comes she to me,
[p]And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
[p]To rid her from this second marriage,
[p]Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
[p]Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
[p]A sleeping potion; which so took effect
[p]As I intended, for it wrought on her
[p]The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
[p]That he should hither come as this dire night,
[p]To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
[p]Being the time the potion's force should cease.
[p]But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
[p]Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
[p]Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
[p]At the prefixed hour of her waking,
[p]Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
[p]Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
[p]Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
[p]But when I came, some minute ere the time
[p]Of her awaking, here untimely lay
[p]The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
[p]She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
[p]And bear this work of heaven with patience:
[p]But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
[p]And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
[p]But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
[p]All this I know; and to the marriage
[p]Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
[p]Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
[p]Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
[p]Unto the rigour of severest law.
"
"We still have known thee for a holy man.
[p]Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
"
"I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
[p]And then in post he came from Mantua
[p]To this same place, to this same monument.
[p]This letter he early bid me give his father,
[p]And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
[p]I departed not and left him there.
"
"Give me the letter; I will look on it.
[p]Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
[p]Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
"
"He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
[p]And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
[p]Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
[p]And by and by my master drew on him;
[p]And then I ran away to call the watch.
"
"This letter doth make good the friar's words,
[p]Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
[p]And here he writes that he did buy a poison
[p]Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
[p]Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
[p]Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
[p]See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
[p]That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
[p]And I for winking at your discords too
[p]Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
"
"O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
[p]This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
[p]Can I demand.
"
"But I can give thee more:
[p]For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
[p]That while Verona by that name is known,
[p]There shall no figure at such rate be set
[p]As that of true and faithful Juliet.
"
"As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
[p]Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
"
"A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
[p]The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
[p]Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
[p]Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
[p]For never was a story of more woe
[p]Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
"
"Good day, sir.
"
"I am glad you're well.
"
"I have not seen you long: how goes the world?
"
"It wears, sir, as it grows.
"
"Ay, that's well known:
[p]But what particular rarity? what strange,
[p]Which manifold record not matches? See,
[p]Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
[p]Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.
"
"I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
"
"O, 'tis a worthy lord.
"
"Nay, that's most fix'd.
"
"A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
[p]To an untirable and continuate goodness:
[p]He passes.
"
"O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
"
"[Reciting to himself] 'When we for recompense have
[p]praised the vile,
[p]It stains the glory in that happy verse
[p]Which aptly sings the good.'
"
"'Tis a good form.
"
"And rich: here is a water, look ye.
"
"You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
[p]To the great lord.
"
"A thing slipp'd idly from me.
[p]Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
[p]From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
[p]Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
[p]Provokes itself and like the current flies
[p]Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
"
"A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?
"
"Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
[p]Let's see your piece.
"
"'Tis a good piece.
"
"So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.
"
"Indifferent.
"
"Admirable: how this grace
[p]Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
[p]This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
[p]Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
[p]One might interpret.
"
"It is a pretty mocking of the life.
[p]Here is a touch; is't good?
"
"I will say of it,
[p]It tutors nature: artificial strife
[p]Lives in these touches, livelier than life.
"
"How this lord is follow'd!
"
"The senators of Athens: happy man!
"
"Look, more!
"
"You see this confluence, this great flood
[p]of visitors.
[p]I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
[p]Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
[p]With amplest entertainment: my free drift
[p]Halts not particularly, but moves itself
[p]In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
[p]Infects one comma in the course I hold;
[p]But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
[p]Leaving no tract behind.
"
"How shall I understand you?
"
"I will unbolt to you.
[p]You see how all conditions, how all minds,
[p]As well of glib and slippery creatures as
[p]Of grave and austere quality, tender down
[p]Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
[p]Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
[p]Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
[p]All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
[p]To Apemantus, that few things loves better
[p]Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
[p]The knee before him, and returns in peace
[p]Most rich in Timon's nod.
"
"I saw them speak together.
"
"Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
[p]Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
[p]Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
[p]That labour on the bosom of this sphere
[p]To propagate their states: amongst them all,
[p]Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,
[p]One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
[p]Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
[p]Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
[p]Translates his rivals.
"
"'Tis conceived to scope.
[p]This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
[p]With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
[p]Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
[p]To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
[p]In our condition.
"
"Nay, sir, but hear me on.
[p]All those which were his fellows but of late,
[p]Some better than his value, on the moment
[p]Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
[p]Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
[p]Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
[p]Drink the free air.
"
"Ay, marry, what of these?
"
"When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
[p]Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants
[p]Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
[p]Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
[p]Not one accompanying his declining foot.
"
"'Tis common:
[p]A thousand moral paintings I can show
[p]That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
[p]More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
[p]To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
[p]The foot above the head.
[p][Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself]
[p]courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from
[p]VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other
[p]servants following]
"
"Imprison'd is he, say you?
"
"Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
[p]His means most short, his creditors most strait:
[p]Your honourable letter he desires
[p]To those have shut him up; which failing,
[p]Periods his comfort.
"
"Noble Ventidius! Well;
[p]I am not of that feather to shake off
[p]My friend when he must need me. I do know him
[p]A gentleman that well deserves a help:
[p]Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,
[p]and free him.
"
"Your lordship ever binds him.
"
"Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
[p]And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
[p]'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
[p]But to support him after. Fare you well.
"
"All happiness to your honour!
"
"Lord Timon, hear me speak.
"
"Freely, good father.
"
"Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.
"
"I have so: what of him?
"
"Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
"
"Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!
"
"Here, at your lordship's service.
"
"This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
[p]By night frequents my house. I am a man
[p]That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
[p]And my estate deserves an heir more raised
[p]Than one which holds a trencher.
"
"Well; what further?
"
"One only daughter have I, no kin else,
[p]On whom I may confer what I have got:
[p]The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
[p]And I have bred her at my dearest cost
[p]In qualities of the best. This man of thine
[p]Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
[p]Join with me to forbid him her resort;
[p]Myself have spoke in vain.
"
"The man is honest.
"
"Therefore he will be, Timon:
[p]His honesty rewards him in itself;
[p]It must not bear my daughter.
"
"Does she love him?
"
"She is young and apt:
[p]Our own precedent passions do instruct us
[p]What levity's in youth.
"
"[To LUCILIUS] Love you the maid?
"
"Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
"
"If in her marriage my consent be missing,
[p]I call the gods to witness, I will choose
[p]Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
[p]And dispossess her all.
"
"How shall she be endow'd,
[p]if she be mated with an equal husband?
"
"Three talents on the present; in future, all.
"
"This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
[p]To build his fortune I will strain a little,
[p]For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
[p]What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
[p]And make him weigh with her.
"
"Most noble lord,
[p]Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
"
"My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
"
"Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
[p]The state or fortune fall into my keeping,
[p]Which is not owed to you!
"
"Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!
"
"I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
[p]Go not away. What have you there, my friend?
"
"A piece of painting, which I do beseech
[p]Your lordship to accept.
"
"Painting is welcome.
[p]The painting is almost the natural man;
[p]or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
[p]He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
[p]Even such as they give out. I like your work;
[p]And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
[p]Till you hear further from me.
"
"The gods preserve ye!
"
"Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;
[p]We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
[p]Hath suffer'd under praise.
"
"What, my lord! dispraise?
"
"A more satiety of commendations.
[p]If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
[p]It would unclew me quite.
"
"My lord, 'tis rated
[p]As those which sell would give: but you well know,
[p]Things of like value differing in the owners
[p]Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
[p]You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
"
"Well mock'd.
"
"No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
[p]Which all men speak with him.
"
"Look, who comes here: will you be chid?
"
"He'll spare none.
"
"Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
"
"Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
[p]When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.
"
"Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.
"
"Are they not Athenians?
"
"Yes.
"
"Then I repent not.
"
"Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
"
"Thou art proud, Apemantus.
"
"Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
"
"Whither art going?
"
"To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
"
"That's a deed thou'lt die for.
"
"Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.
"
"How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?
"
"The best, for the innocence.
"
"Wrought he not well that painted it?
"
"He wrought better that made the painter; and yet
[p]he's but a filthy piece of work.
"
"You're a dog.
"
"Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?
"
"Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
"
"No; I eat not lords.
"
"An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.
"
"O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
"
"That's a lascivious apprehension.
"
"So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.
"
"How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
"
"Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a
[p]man a doit.
"
"What dost thou think 'tis worth?
"
"Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
"
"How now, philosopher!
"
"Thou liest.
"
"Art not one?
"
"Yes.
"
"Then I lie not.
"
"Art not a poet?
"
"Yes.
"
"Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou
[p]hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
"
"That's not feigned; he is so.
"
"Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
[p]labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
[p]the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!
"
"What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
"
"E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.
"
"What, thyself?
"
"Ay.
"
"Wherefore?
"
"That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
[p]Art not thou a merchant?
"
"Ay, Apemantus.
"
"Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
"
"If traffic do it, the gods do it.
"
"Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!
"
"What trumpet's that?
"
"'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
[p]All of companionship.
"
"Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.
[p][Exeunt some Attendants]
[p]You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
[p]Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,
[p]Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
[p][Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest]
[p]Most welcome, sir!
"
"So, so, there!
[p]Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
[p]That there should be small love 'mongst these
[p]sweet knaves,
[p]And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
[p]Into baboon and monkey.
"
"Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed
[p]Most hungerly on your sight.
"
"Right welcome, sir!
[p]Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time
[p]In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.
"
"What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
"
"Time to be honest.
"
"That time serves still.
"
"The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.
"
"Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
"
"Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
"
"Fare thee well, fare thee well.
"
"Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
"
"Why, Apemantus?
"
"Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to
[p]give thee none.
"
"Hang thyself!
"
"No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy
[p]requests to thy friend.
"
"Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!
"
"I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.
"
"He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
[p]And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
[p]The very heart of kindness.
"
"He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
[p]Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays
[p]Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,
[p]But breeds the giver a return exceeding
[p]All use of quittance.
"
"The noblest mind he carries
[p]That ever govern'd man.
"
"Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
"
"I'll keep you company.
"
"Most honour'd Timon,
[p]It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,
[p]And call him to long peace.
[p]He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
[p]Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
[p]To your free heart, I do return those talents,
[p]Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
[p]I derived liberty.
"
"O, by no means,
[p]Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:
[p]I gave it freely ever; and there's none
[p]Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
[p]If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
[p]To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.
"
"A noble spirit!
"
"Nay, my lords,
[p][They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON]
[p]Ceremony was but devised at first
[p]To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
[p]Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
[p]But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
[p]Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
[p]Than my fortunes to me.
"
"My lord, we always have confess'd it.
"
"Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?
"
"O, Apemantus, you are welcome.
"
"No;
[p]You shall not make me welcome:
[p]I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
"
"Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there
[p]Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
[p]They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond
[p]man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by
[p]himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
[p]he fit for't, indeed.
"
"Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to
[p]observe; I give thee warning on't.
"
"I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,
[p]therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;
[p]prithee, let my meat make thee silent.
"
"I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
[p]ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
[p]men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me
[p]to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;
[p]and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
[p]I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
[p]Methinks they should invite them without knives;
[p]Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
[p]There's much example for't; the fellow that sits
[p]next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
[p]breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
[p]man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
[p]huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
[p]Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
[p]Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
"
"My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.
"
"Let it flow this way, my good lord.
"
"Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides
[p]well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
[p]look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to
[p]be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
[p]This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
[p]Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
[p]Apemantus' grace.
[p]Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
[p]I pray for no man but myself:
[p]Grant I may never prove so fond,
[p]To trust man on his oath or bond;
[p]Or a harlot, for her weeping;
[p]Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:
[p]Or a keeper with my freedom;
[p]Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
[p]Amen. So fall to't:
[p]Rich men sin, and I eat root.
[p][Eats and drinks]
[p]Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!
"
"Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.
"
"My heart is ever at your service, my lord.
"
"You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
[p]dinner of friends.
"
"So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat
[p]like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.
"
"Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,
[p]that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!
"
"Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
[p]would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
[p]some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
[p]for ever perfect.
"
"O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
[p]themselves have provided that I shall have much help
[p]from you: how had you been my friends else? why
[p]have you that charitable title from thousands, did
[p]not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
[p]more of you to myself than you can with modesty
[p]speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
[p]you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
[p]friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they
[p]were the most needless creatures living, should we
[p]ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble
[p]sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
[p]sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
[p]myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
[p]are born to do benefits: and what better or
[p]properer can we can our own than the riches of our
[p]friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have
[p]so many, like brothers, commanding one another's
[p]fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!
[p]Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
[p]forget their faults, I drink to you.
"
"Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.
"
"Joy had the like conception in our eyes
[p]And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
"
"Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
"
"I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.
"
"Much!
"
"What means that trump?
[p][Enter a Servant]
[p]How now?
"
"Please you, my lord, there are certain
[p]ladies most desirous of admittance.
"
"Ladies! what are their wills?
"
"There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which
[p]bears that office, to signify their pleasures.
"
"I pray, let them be admitted.
"
"Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all
[p]That of his bounties taste! The five best senses
[p]Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely
[p]To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,
[p]Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;
[p]They only now come but to feast thine eyes.
"
"They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:
[p]Music, make their welcome!
"
"You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.
[p][Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies]
[p]as Amazons, with lutes in their hands,
[p]dancing and playing]
"
"Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
[p]They dance! they are mad women.
[p]Like madness is the glory of this life.
[p]As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
[p]We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;
[p]And spend our flatteries, to drink those men
[p]Upon whose age we void it up again,
[p]With poisonous spite and envy.
[p]Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
[p]Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
[p]Of their friends' gift?
[p]I should fear those that dance before me now
[p]Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;
[p]Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
[p][The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of]
[p]TIMON; and to show their loves, each singles out an
[p]Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty
[p]strain or two to the hautboys, and cease]
"
"You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
[p]Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
[p]Which was not half so beautiful and kind;
[p]You have added worth unto 't and lustre,
[p]And entertain'd me with mine own device;
[p]I am to thank you for 't.
"
"My lord, you take us even at the best.
"
"'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold
[p]taking, I doubt me.
"
"Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:
[p]Please you to dispose yourselves.
"
"Most thankfully, my lord.
"
"Flavius.
"
"My lord?
"
"The little casket bring me hither.
"
"Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!
[p]There is no crossing him in 's humour;
[p][Aside]
[p]Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
[p]When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.
[p]'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
[p]That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.
"
"Where be our men?
"
"Here, my lord, in readiness.
"
"Our horses!
"
"O my friends,
[p]I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,
[p]I must entreat you, honour me so much
[p]As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
[p]Kind my lord.
"
"I am so far already in your gifts,--
"
"So are we all.
"
"My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate
[p]Newly alighted, and come to visit you.
"
"They are fairly welcome.
"
"I beseech your honour,
[p]Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.
"
"Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:
[p]I prithee, let's be provided to show them
[p]entertainment.
"
"[Aside] I scarce know how.
"
"May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,
[p]Out of his free love, hath presented to you
[p]Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.
"
"I shall accept them fairly; let the presents
[p]Be worthily entertain'd.
[p][Enter a third Servant]
[p]How now! what news?
"
"Please you, my lord, that honourable
[p]gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company
[p]to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour
[p]two brace of greyhounds.
"
"I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
[p]Not without fair reward.
"
"[Aside] What will this come to?
[p]He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,
[p]And all out of an empty coffer:
[p]Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
[p]To show him what a beggar his heart is,
[p]Being of no power to make his wishes good:
[p]His promises fly so beyond his state
[p]That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
[p]For every word: he is so kind that he now
[p]Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.
[p]Well, would I were gently put out of office
[p]Before I were forced out!
[p]Happier is he that has no friend to feed
[p]Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
[p]I bleed inwardly for my lord.
"
"You do yourselves
[p]Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:
[p]Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.
"
"With more than common thanks I will receive it.
"
"O, he's the very soul of bounty!
"
"And now I remember, my lord, you gave
[p]Good words the other day of a bay courser
[p]I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.
"
"O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.
"
"You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man
[p]Can justly praise but what he does affect:
[p]I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;
[p]I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.
"
"O, none so welcome.
"
"I take all and your several visitations
[p]So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
[p]Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
[p]And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
[p]Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;
[p]It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living
[p]Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
[p]Lie in a pitch'd field.
"
"Ay, defiled land, my lord.
"
"We are so virtuously bound--
"
"And so
[p]Am I to you.
"
"So infinitely endear'd--
"
"All to you. Lights, more lights!
"
"The best of happiness,
[p]Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!
"
"Ready for his friends.
"
"What a coil's here!
[p]Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
[p]I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
[p]That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
[p]Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,
[p]Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.
"
"Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be
[p]good to thee.
"
"No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,
[p]there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then
[p]thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,
[p]Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
[p]paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and
[p]vain-glories?
"
"Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am
[p]sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come
[p]with better music.
"
"So:
[p]Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:
[p]I'll lock thy heaven from thee.
[p]O, that men's ears should be
[p]To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!
"
"And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore
[p]He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,
[p]Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
[p]Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.
[p]If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,
[p]And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
[p]If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more
[p]Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
[p]Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,
[p]And able horses. No porter at his gate,
[p]But rather one that smiles and still invites
[p]All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason
[p]Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
[p]Caphis, I say!
"
"Here, sir; what is your pleasure?
"
"Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;
[p]Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased
[p]With slight denial, nor then silenced when--
[p]'Commend me to your master'--and the cap
[p]Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,
[p]My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
[p]Out of mine own; his days and times are past
[p]And my reliances on his fracted dates
[p]Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,
[p]But must not break my back to heal his finger;
[p]Immediate are my needs, and my relief
[p]Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
[p]But find supply immediate. Get you gone:
[p]Put on a most importunate aspect,
[p]A visage of demand; for, I do fear,
[p]When every feather sticks in his own wing,
[p]Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
[p]Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.
"
"I go, sir.
"
"'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,
[p]And have the dates in contempt.
"
"I will, sir.
"
"Go.
"
"No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
[p]That he will neither know how to maintain it,
[p]Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account
[p]How things go from him, nor resumes no care
[p]Of what is to continue: never mind
[p]Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.
[p]What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel:
[p]I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.
[p]Fie, fie, fie, fie!
"
"Good even, Varro: what,
[p]You come for money?
"
"It is: and yours too, Isidore?
"
"Would we were all discharged!
"
"Here comes the lord.
"
"So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,
[p]My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?
"
"My lord, here is a note of certain dues.
"
"Dues! Whence are you?
"
"Of Athens here, my lord.
"
"Go to my steward.
"
"Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
[p]To the succession of new days this month:
[p]My master is awaked by great occasion
[p]To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
[p]That with your other noble parts you'll suit
[p]In giving him his right.
"
"Mine honest friend,
[p]I prithee, but repair to me next morning.
"
"Nay, good my lord,--
"
"Contain thyself, good friend.
[p]He humbly prays your speedy payment.
"
"If you did know, my lord, my master's wants--
[p]And I am sent expressly to your lordship.
"
"Give me breath.
[p]I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
[p]I'll wait upon you instantly.
[p][Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords]
[p][To FLAVIUS]
[p]Come hither: pray you,
[p]How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd
[p]With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,
[p]And the detention of long-since-due debts,
[p]Against my honour?
"
"Please you, gentlemen,
[p]The time is unagreeable to this business:
[p]Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
[p]That I may make his lordship understand
[p]Wherefore you are not paid.
"
"Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd.
"
"Pray, draw near.
"
"Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus:
[p]let's ha' some sport with 'em.
"
"Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
"
"No,'tis to thyself.
[p][To the Fool]
[p]Come away.
"
"No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.
"
"Where's the fool now?
"
"He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and
[p]usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
"
"What are we, Apemantus?
"
"Asses.
"
"Why?
"
"That you ask me what you are, and do not know
[p]yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.
"
"How do you, gentlemen?
"
"Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?
"
"She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens
[p]as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
"
"Good! gramercy.
"
"Look you, here comes my mistress' page.
"
"[To the Fool] Why, how now, captain! what do you
[p]in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?
"
"Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer
[p]thee profitably.
"
"Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of
[p]these letters: I know not which is which.
"
"Canst not read?
"
"No.
"
"There will little learning die then, that day thou
[p]art hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to
[p]Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard, and thou't
[p]die a bawd.
"
"Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a
[p]dog's death. Answer not; I am gone.
"
"E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool, I will go with
[p]you to Lord Timon's.
"
"Will you leave me there?
"
"If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
"
"Ay; would they served us!
"
"So would I,--as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.
"
"Are you three usurers' men?
"
"Ay, fool.
"
"I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my
[p]mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come
[p]to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and
[p]go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house
[p]merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?
"
"Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster
[p]and a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt be
[p]no less esteemed.
"
"A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.
[p]'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;
[p]sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,
[p]with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is
[p]very often like a knight; and, generally, in all
[p]shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore
[p]to thirteen, this spirit walks in.
"
"Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as
[p]I have, so much wit thou lackest.
"
"That answer might have become Apemantus.
"
"Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.
"
"Come with me, fool, come.
"
"I do not always follow lover, elder brother and
[p]woman; sometime the philosopher.
"
"Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.
"
"You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time
[p]Had you not fully laid my state before me,
[p]That I might so have rated my expense,
[p]As I had leave of means?
"
"You would not hear me,
[p]At many leisures I proposed.
"
"Go to:
[p]Perchance some single vantages you took.
[p]When my indisposition put you back:
[p]And that unaptness made your minister,
[p]Thus to excuse yourself.
"
"O my good lord,
[p]At many times I brought in my accounts,
[p]Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
[p]And say, you found them in mine honesty.
[p]When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
[p]Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;
[p]Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
[p]To hold your hand more close: I did endure
[p]Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have
[p]Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
[p]And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
[p]Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--
[p]The greatest of your having lacks a half
[p]To pay your present debts.
"
"Let all my land be sold.
"
"'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone;
[p]And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
[p]Of present dues: the future comes apace:
[p]What shall defend the interim? and at length
[p]How goes our reckoning?
"
"To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
"
"O my good lord, the world is but a word:
[p]Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
[p]How quickly were it gone!
"
"You tell me true.
"
"If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
[p]Call me before the exactest auditors
[p]And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
[p]When all our offices have been oppress'd
[p]With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
[p]With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
[p]Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
[p]I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
[p]And set mine eyes at flow.
"
"Prithee, no more.
"
"Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!
[p]How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
[p]This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
[p]What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is
[p]Lord Timon's?
[p]Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!
[p]Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
[p]The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
[p]Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,
[p]These flies are couch'd.
"
"Come, sermon me no further:
[p]No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
[p]Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
[p]Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,
[p]To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
[p]If I would broach the vessels of my love,
[p]And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
[p]Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
[p]As I can bid thee speak.
"
"Assurance bless your thoughts!
"
"And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,
[p]That I account them blessings; for by these
[p]Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
[p]Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.
[p]Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!
"
"My lord? my lord?
"
"I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;
[p]to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour
[p]to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their
[p]loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have
[p]found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let
[p]the request be fifty talents.
"
"As you have said, my lord.
"
"[Aside] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!
"
"Go you, sir, to the senators--
[p]Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have
[p]Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant
[p]A thousand talents to me.
"
"I have been bold--
[p]For that I knew it the most general way--
[p]To them to use your signet and your name;
[p]But they do shake their heads, and I am here
[p]No richer in return.
"
"Is't true? can't be?
"
"They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,
[p]That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
[p]Do what they would; are sorry--you are honourable,--
[p]But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--
[p]Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
[p]May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity;--
[p]And so, intending other serious matters,
[p]After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,
[p]With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
[p]They froze me into silence.
"
"You gods, reward them!
[p]Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
[p]Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
[p]Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
[p]'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
[p]And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
[p]Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.
[p][To a Servant]
[p]Go to Ventidius.
[p][To FLAVIUS]
[p]Prithee, be not sad,
[p]Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.
[p]No blame belongs to thee.
[p][To Servant]
[p]Ventidius lately
[p]Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd
[p]Into a great estate: when he was poor,
[p]Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,
[p]I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;
[p]Bid him suppose some good necessity
[p]Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd
[p]With those five talents.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p][To FLAVIUS]
[p]That had, give't these fellows
[p]To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,
[p]That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.
"
"I would I could not think it: that thought is
[p]bounty's foe;
[p]Being free itself, it thinks all others so.
"
"I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.
"
"I thank you, sir.
"
"Here's my lord.
"
"[Aside] One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I
[p]warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver
[p]basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest
[p]Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir.
[p]Fill me some wine.
[p][Exit Servants]
[p]And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted
[p]gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord
[p]and master?
"
"His health is well sir.
"
"I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and
[p]what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?
"
"'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my
[p]lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to
[p]supply; who, having great and instant occasion to
[p]use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to
[p]furnish him, nothing doubting your present
[p]assistance therein.
"
"La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,
[p]good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not
[p]keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'
[p]dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to
[p]supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,
[p]and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning
[p]by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty
[p]is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get
[p]him from't.
"
"Please your lordship, here is the wine.
"
"Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.
"
"Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
"
"I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
[p]spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what
[p]belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if
[p]the time use thee well: good parts in thee.
[p][To Servant]
[p]Get you gone, sirrah.
[p][Exit Servant]
[p]Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a
[p]bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou
[p]knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,
[p]that this is no time to lend money, especially upon
[p]bare friendship, without security. Here's three
[p]solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say
[p]thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.
"
"Is't possible the world should so much differ,
[p]And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,
[p]To him that worships thee!
"
"Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.
"
"May these add to the number that may scald thee!
[p]Let moulten coin be thy damnation,
[p]Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!
[p]Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,
[p]It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,
[p]I feel master's passion! this slave,
[p]Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:
[p]Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,
[p]When he is turn'd to poison?
[p]O, may diseases only work upon't!
[p]And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
[p]Which my lord paid for, be of any power
[p]To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!
"
"Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and
[p]an honourable gentleman.
"
"We know him for no less, though we are but strangers
[p]to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
[p]which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
[p]happy hours are done and past, and his estate
[p]shrinks from him.
"
"Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
"
"But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,
[p]one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
[p]so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and
[p]showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.
"
"How!
"
"I tell you, denied, my lord.
"
"What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,
[p]I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!
[p]there was very little honour showed in't. For my own
[p]part, I must needs confess, I have received some
[p]small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels
[p]and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;
[p]yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should
[p]ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.
"
"See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;
[p]I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,--
"
"Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:
[p]commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very
[p]exquisite friend.
"
"May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--
"
"Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to
[p]that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank
[p]him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?
"
"Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;
[p]requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
[p]with so many talents.
"
"I know his lordship is but merry with me;
[p]He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.
"
"But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
[p]If his occasion were not virtuous,
[p]I should not urge it half so faithfully.
"
"Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
"
"Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.
"
"What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself
[p]against such a good time, when I might ha' shown
[p]myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I
[p]should purchase the day before for a little part,
[p]and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,
[p]before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more
[p]beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon
[p]myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would
[p]not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.
[p]Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I
[p]hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,
[p]because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
[p]this from me, I count it one of my greatest
[p]afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
[p]honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you
[p]befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?
"
"Yes, sir, I shall.
"
"I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.
[p][Exit SERVILIUS]
[p]True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;
[p]And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
"
"Do you observe this, Hostilius?
"
"Ay, too well.
"
"Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the
[p]same piece
[p]Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
[p]His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
[p]My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
[p]And kept his credit with his purse,
[p]Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
[p]Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,
[p]But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
[p]And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man
[p]When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
[p]He does deny him, in respect of his,
[p]What charitable men afford to beggars.
"
"Religion groans at it.
"
"For mine own part,
[p]I never tasted Timon in my life,
[p]Nor came any of his bounties over me,
[p]To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
[p]For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
[p]And honourable carriage,
[p]Had his necessity made use of me,
[p]I would have put my wealth into donation,
[p]And the best half should have return'd to him,
[p]So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
[p]Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
[p]For policy sits above conscience.
"
"Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'bove
[p]all others?
[p]He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
[p]And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
[p]Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
[p]Owe their estates unto him.
"
"My lord,
[p]They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
[p]They have au denied him.
"
"How! have they denied him?
[p]Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
[p]And does he send to me? Three? hum!
[p]It shows but little love or judgment in him:
[p]Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
[p]physicians,
[p]Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
[p]Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,
[p]That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,
[p]But his occasion might have woo'd me first;
[p]For, in my conscience, I was the first man
[p]That e'er received gift from him:
[p]And does he think so backwardly of me now,
[p]That I'll requite its last? No:
[p]So it may prove an argument of laughter
[p]To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.
[p]I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
[p]Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
[p]I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
[p]And with their faint reply this answer join;
[p]Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
"
"Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
[p]devil knew not what he did when he made man
[p]politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot
[p]think but, in the end, the villainies of man will
[p]set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
[p]appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,
[p]like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
[p]whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
[p]politic love.
[p]This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,
[p]Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,
[p]Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
[p]Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
[p]Now to guard sure their master.
[p]And this is all a liberal course allows;
[p]Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.
"
"Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.
"
"The like to you kind Varro.
"
"Lucius!
[p]What, do we meet together?
[p]One business does command us all; for mine Is money.
"
"So is theirs and ours.
"
"Good day at once.
[p]What do you think the hour?
"
"Labouring for nine.
"
"Is not my lord seen yet?
"
"I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.
[p]You must consider that a prodigal course
[p]Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
[p]I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
[p]That is one may reach deep enough, and yet
[p]Find little.
"
"I am of your fear for that.
"
"I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
[p]Your lord sends now for money.
"
"Most true, he does.
"
"And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
[p]For which I wait for money.
"
"It is against my heart.
[p]Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
[p]And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,
[p]And send for money for 'em.
"
"I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:
[p]I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,
[p]And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
"
"Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?
"
"'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,
[p]Your master's confidence was above mine;
[p]Else, surely, his had equall'd.
[p]Enter Flaminius.
"
"One of Lord Timon's men.
[p]come forth?
"
"No, indeed, he is not.
"
"We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.
"
"I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.
"
"Do you hear, sir?
"
"By your leave, sir,--
"
"What do ye ask of me, my friend?
"
"We wait for certain money here, sir.
"
"Ay,
[p]If money were as certain as your waiting,
[p]'Twere sure enough.
[p]Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
[p]When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
[p]Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
[p]And take down the interest into their
[p]gluttonous maws.
[p]You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
[p]Let me pass quietly:
[p]Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;
[p]I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
"
"If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;
[p]For you serve knaves.
"
"How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
"
"No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge
[p]enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
[p]house to put his head in? such may rail against
[p]great buildings.
"
"O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
"
"If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some
[p]other hour, I should derive much from't; for,
[p]take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to
[p]discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;
[p]he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
[p]And, if it be so far beyond his health,
[p]Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
[p]And make a clear way to the gods.
"
"Good gods!
"
"We cannot take this for answer, sir.
"
"[Within] Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!
"
"What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
[p]Have I been ever free, and must my house
[p]Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
[p]The place which I have feasted, does it now,
[p]Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
"
"My lord, here is my bill.
"
"And mine, my lord.
"
"All our bills.
"
"Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
"
"Cut my heart in sums.
"
"Mine, fifty talents.
"
"Tell out my blood.
"
"Five thousand drops pays that.
[p]What yours?--and yours?
"
"My lord,--
"
"My lord,--
"
"Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!
"
"'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps
[p]at their money: these debts may well be called
[p]desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.
"
"They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
[p]Creditors? devils!
"
"My dear lord,--
"
"What if it should be so?
"
"My lord,--
"
"I'll have it so. My steward!
"
"Here, my lord.
"
"So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,
[p]Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:
[p]All, sirrah, all:
[p]I'll once more feast the rascals.
"
"O my lord,
[p]You only speak from your distracted soul;
[p]There is not so much left, to furnish out
[p]A moderate table.
"
"Be't not in thy care; go,
[p]I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide
[p]Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
"
"My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's
[p]Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:
[p]Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
"
"Most true; the law shall bruise him.
"
"Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!
"
"Now, captain?
"
"I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
[p]For pity is the virtue of the law,
[p]And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
[p]It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
[p]Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
[p]Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
[p]To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.
[p]He is a man, setting his fate aside,
[p]Of comely virtues:
[p]Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
[p]An honour in him which buys out his fault--
[p]But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
[p]Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
[p]He did oppose his foe:
[p]And with such sober and unnoted passion
[p]He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
[p]As if he had but proved an argument.
"
"You undergo too strict a paradox,
[p]Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
[p]Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
[p]To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
[p]Upon the head of valour; which indeed
[p]Is valour misbegot and came into the world
[p]When sects and factions were newly born:
[p]He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
[p]The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
[p]His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,
[p]carelessly,
[p]And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
[p]To bring it into danger.
[p]If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
[p]What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
"
"My lord,--
"
"You cannot make gross sins look clear:
[p]To revenge is no valour, but to bear.
"
"My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,
[p]If I speak like a captain.
[p]Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
[p]And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,
[p]And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
[p]Without repugnancy? If there be
[p]Such valour in the bearing, what make we
[p]Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
[p]That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
[p]And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
[p]Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
[p]If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,
[p]As you are great, be pitifully good:
[p]Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
[p]To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
[p]But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
[p]To be in anger is impiety;
[p]But who is man that is not angry?
[p]Weigh but the crime with this.
"
"You breathe in vain.
"
"In vain! his service done
[p]At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
[p]Were a sufficient briber for his life.
"
"What's that?
"
"I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
[p]And slain in fight many of your enemies:
[p]How full of valour did he bear himself
[p]In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
"
"He has made too much plenty with 'em;
[p]He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
[p]Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:
[p]If there were no foes, that were enough
[p]To overcome him: in that beastly fury
[p]He has been known to commit outrages,
[p]And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
[p]His days are foul and his drink dangerous.
"
"He dies.
"
"Hard fate! he might have died in war.
[p]My lords, if not for any parts in him--
[p]Though his right arm might purchase his own time
[p]And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,
[p]Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:
[p]And, for I know your reverend ages love
[p]Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
[p]My honours to you, upon his good returns.
[p]If by this crime he owes the law his life,
[p]Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore
[p]For law is strict, and war is nothing more.
"
"We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,
[p]On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,
[p]He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
"
"Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
[p]I do beseech you, know me.
"
"How!
"
"Call me to your remembrances.
"
"What!
"
"I cannot think but your age has forgot me;
[p]It could not else be, I should prove so base,
[p]To sue, and be denied such common grace:
[p]My wounds ache at you.
"
"Do you dare our anger?
[p]'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;
[p]We banish thee for ever.
"
"Banish me!
[p]Banish your dotage; banish usury,
[p]That makes the senate ugly.
"
"If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,
[p]Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell
[p]our spirit,
[p]He shall be executed presently.
"
"Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live
[p]Only in bone, that none may look on you!
[p]I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,
[p]While they have told their money and let out
[p]Their coin upon large interest, I myself
[p]Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
[p]Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
[p]Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
[p]It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
[p]It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
[p]That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up
[p]My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.
[p]'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
[p]Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
"
"The good time of day to you, sir.
"
"I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
[p]did but try us this other day.
"
"Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we
[p]encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as
[p]he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.
"
"It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.
"
"I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest
[p]inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me
[p]to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and
[p]I must needs appear.
"
"In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
[p]business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am
[p]sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my
[p]provision was out.
"
"I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
[p]things go.
"
"Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
[p]you?
"
"A thousand pieces.
"
"A thousand pieces!
"
"What of you?
"
"He sent to me, sir,--Here he comes.
"
"With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?
"
"Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
"
"The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
[p]your lordship.
"
"[Aside] Nor more willingly leaves winter; such
[p]summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not
[p]recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the
[p]music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the
[p]trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.
"
"I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
[p]that I returned you an empty messenger.
"
"O, sir, let it not trouble you.
"
"My noble lord,--
"
"Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
"
"My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,
[p]that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,
[p]I was so unfortunate a beggar.
"
"Think not on 't, sir.
"
"If you had sent but two hours before,--
"
"Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
[p][The banquet brought in]
[p]Come, bring in all together.
"
"All covered dishes!
"
"Royal cheer, I warrant you.
"
"Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield
[p]it.
"
"How do you? What's the news?
"
"Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?
"
"[with Second Lord] Alcibiades banished!
"
"'Tis so, be sure of it.
"
"How! how!
"
"I pray you, upon what?
"
"My worthy friends, will you draw near?
"
"I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
"
"This is the old man still.
"
"Will 't hold? will 't hold?
"
"It does: but time will--and so--
"
"I do conceive.
"
"Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to
[p]the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
[p]places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let
[p]the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:
[p]sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
[p]You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with
[p]thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves
[p]praised: but reserve still to give, lest your
[p]deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that
[p]one need not lend to another; for, were your
[p]godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the
[p]gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
[p]that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
[p]a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
[p]the table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. The
[p]rest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,
[p]together with the common lag of people--what is
[p]amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for
[p]destruction. For these my present friends, as they
[p]are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to
[p]nothing are they welcome.
[p]Uncover, dogs, and lap.
[p][The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of]
[p]warm water]
"
"What does his lordship mean?
"
"I know not.
"
"May you a better feast never behold,
[p]You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water
[p]Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
[p]Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
[p]Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces
[p]Your reeking villany.
[p][Throwing the water in their faces]
[p]Live loathed and long,
[p]Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
[p]Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,
[p]You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,
[p]Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!
[p]Of man and beast the infinite malady
[p]Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?
[p]Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--
[p]Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.
[p][Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out]
[p]What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,
[p]Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
[p]Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be
[p]Of Timon man and all humanity!
"
"How now, my lords!
"
"Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
"
"Push! did you see my cap?
"
"I have lost my gown.
"
"He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.
[p]He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has
[p]beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?
"
"Did you see my cap?
"
"Here 'tis.
"
"Here lies my gown.
"
"Let's make no stay.
"
"Lord Timon's mad.
"
"I feel 't upon my bones.
"
"One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
"
"Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
[p]That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,
[p]And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!
[p]Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
[p]Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
[p]And minister in their steads! to general filths
[p]Convert o' the instant, green virginity,
[p]Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;
[p]Rather than render back, out with your knives,
[p]And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
[p]Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
[p]And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
[p]Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
[p]pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,
[p]With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
[p]Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
[p]Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
[p]Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
[p]Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
[p]Decline to your confounding contraries,
[p]And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,
[p]Your potent and infectious fevers heap
[p]On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
[p]Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
[p]As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty
[p]Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
[p]That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
[p]And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
[p]Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop
[p]Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
[p]at their society, as their friendship, may
[p]merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,
[p]But nakedness, thou detestable town!
[p]Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
[p]Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
[p]The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
[p]The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--
[p]The Athenians both within and out that wall!
[p]And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
[p]To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.
"
"Hear you, master steward, where's our master?
[p]Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?
"
"Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
[p]Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
[p]I am as poor as you.
"
"Such a house broke!
[p]So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not
[p]One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
[p]And go along with him!
"
"As we do turn our backs
[p]From our companion thrown into his grave,
[p]So his familiars to his buried fortunes
[p]Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,
[p]Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,
[p]A dedicated beggar to the air,
[p]With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,
[p]Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.
"
"All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
"
"Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;
[p]That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,
[p]Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,
[p]And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
[p]Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
[p]Into this sea of air.
"
"Good fellows all,
[p]The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
[p]Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
[p]Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,
[p]As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
[p]'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;
[p]Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:
[p]Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
[p][Servants embrace, and part several ways]
[p]O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
[p]Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
[p]Since riches point to misery and contempt?
[p]Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
[p]But in a dream of friendship?
[p]To have his pomp and all what state compounds
[p]But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
[p]Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
[p]Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
[p]When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!
[p]Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?
[p]For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
[p]My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
[p]Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
[p]Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!
[p]He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
[p]Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to
[p]Supply his life, or that which can command it.
[p]I'll follow and inquire him out:
[p]I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;
[p]Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.
"
"O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
[p]Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
[p]Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,
[p]Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
[p]Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
[p]The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
[p]To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,
[p]But by contempt of nature.
[p]Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;
[p]The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
[p]The beggar native honour.
[p]It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
[p]The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
[p]In purity of manhood stand upright,
[p]And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,
[p]So are they all; for every grise of fortune
[p]Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
[p]Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
[p]There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
[p]But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
[p]All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
[p]His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:
[p]Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
[p][Digging]
[p]Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
[p]With thy most operant poison! What is here?
[p]Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,
[p]I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!
[p]Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
[p]Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
[p]Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this
[p]Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
[p]Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
[p]This yellow slave
[p]Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
[p]Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
[p]And give them title, knee and approbation
[p]With senators on the bench: this is it
[p]That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
[p]She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
[p]Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
[p]To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
[p]Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds
[p]Among the route of nations, I will make thee
[p]Do thy right nature.
[p][March afar off]
[p]Ha! a drum? Thou'rt quick,
[p]But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,
[p]When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
[p]Nay, stay thou out for earnest.

[p]warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA]
"
"What art thou there? speak.
"
"A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
[p]For showing me again the eyes of man!
"
"What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,
[p]That art thyself a man?
"
"I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
[p]For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
[p]That I might love thee something.
"
"I know thee well;
[p]But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
"
"I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,
[p]I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;
[p]With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:
[p]Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;
[p]Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
[p]Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
[p]For all her cherubim look.
"
"Thy lips rot off!
"
"I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
[p]To thine own lips again.
"
"How came the noble Timon to this change?
"
"As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
[p]But then renew I could not, like the moon;
[p]There were no suns to borrow of.
"
"Noble Timon,
[p]What friendship may I do thee?
"
"None, but to
[p]Maintain my opinion.
"
"What is it, Timon?
"
"Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou
[p]wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art
[p]a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for
[p]thou art a man!
"
"I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
"
"Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
"
"I see them now; then was a blessed time.
"
"As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
"
"Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world
[p]Voiced so regardfully?
"
"Art thou Timandra?
"
"Yes.
"
"Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;
[p]Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
[p]Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
[p]For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
[p]To the tub-fast and the diet.
"
"Hang thee, monster!
"
"Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits
[p]Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
[p]I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
[p]The want whereof doth daily make revolt
[p]In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,
[p]How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
[p]Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
[p]But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--
"
"I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.
"
"I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.
"
"How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
[p]I had rather be alone.
"
"Why, fare thee well:
[p]Here is some gold for thee.
"
"Keep it, I cannot eat it.
"
"When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--
"
"Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?
"
"Ay, Timon, and have cause.
"
"The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
[p]And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!
"
"Why me, Timon?
"
"That, by killing of villains,
[p]Thou wast born to conquer my country.
[p]Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;
[p]Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
[p]Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
[p]In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
[p]Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
[p]He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
[p]It is her habit only that is honest,
[p]Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
[p]Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,
[p]That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
[p]Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
[p]But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
[p]Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
[p]Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
[p]Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
[p]And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
[p]Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
[p]Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
[p]Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
[p]Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:
[p]Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
[p]Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.
"
"Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou
[p]givest me,
[p]Not all thy counsel.
"
"Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse
[p]upon thee!
"
"[with Timandra] Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?
"
"Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
[p]And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
[p]Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,
[p]Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear
[p]Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
[p]The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,
[p]I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;
[p]And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
[p]Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
[p]Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
[p]And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
[p]Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
[p]With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,
[p]No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;
[p]Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,
[p]A pox of wrinkles!
"
"[with Timandra] Well, more gold: what then? [p]Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold."
"Consumptions sow
[p]In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
[p]And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
[p]That he may never more false title plead,
[p]Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
[p]That scolds against the quality of flesh,
[p]And not believes himself: down with the nose,
[p]Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
[p]Of him that, his particular to foresee,
[p]Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate
[p]ruffians bald;
[p]And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
[p]Derive some pain from you: plague all;
[p]That your activity may defeat and quell
[p]The source of all erection. There's more gold:
[p]Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
[p]And ditches grave you all!
"
"[with Timandra] More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.
"
"More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.
"
"Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:
[p]If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.
"
"If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
"
"I never did thee harm.
"
"Yes, thou spokest well of me.
"
"Call'st thou that harm?
"
"Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
[p]Thy beagles with thee.
"
"We but offend him. Strike!
[p][Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA,]
[p]and TIMANDRA]
"
"That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
[p]Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,

[p]Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,

[p]Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
[p]Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
[p]The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
[p]With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
[p]Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;
[p]Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,

[p]Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
[p]Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts
[p]And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
[p]That from it all consideration slips!

"I was directed hither: men report
[p]Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.
"
"'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
[p]Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!
"
"This is in thee a nature but infected;
[p]A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
[p]From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
[p]This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
[p]Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;
[p]Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot
[p]That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
[p]By putting on the cunning of a carper.
[p]Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
[p]By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
[p]And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
[p]Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
[p]And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;
[p]Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
[p]To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
[p]That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
[p]Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.
"
"Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.

"Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;

[p]That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
[p]Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,

[p]And skip where thou point'st out? will the
[p]cold brook,
[p]Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
[p]To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
[p]Whose naked natures live in an the spite
[p]Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
[p]To the conflicting elements exposed,

[p]O, thou shalt find--

"A fool of thee: depart.
"
"I love thee better now than e'er I did.

"I hate thee worse.
"
"Why?

"Thou flatter'st misery.

"I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.

"Why dost thou seek me out?

"To vex thee.
"
"Always a villain's office or a fool's.
[p]Dost please thyself in't?
"
"Ay.
"
"What! a knave too?
"
"If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
[p]To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou
[p]Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,
[p]Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
[p]Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:
[p]The one is filling still, never complete;
[p]The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
[p]Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
[p]Worse than the worst, content.
[p]Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.
"
"Not by his breath that is more miserable.
[p]Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm
[p]With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
[p]Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
[p]The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
[p]To such as may the passive drugs of it
[p]Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself
[p]In general riot; melted down thy youth
[p]In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
[p]The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
[p]The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
[p]Who had the world as my confectionary,
[p]The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
[p]At duty, more than I could frame employment,
[p]That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
[p]Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
[p]Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
[p]For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,
[p]That never knew but better, is some burden:
[p]Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
[p]Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
[p]They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
[p]If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
[p]Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
[p]To some she beggar and compounded thee
[p]Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
[p]If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
[p]Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
"
"Art thou proud yet?
"
"Ay, that I am not thee.
"
"I, that I was
[p]No prodigal.
"
"I, that I am one now:
[p]Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
[p]I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
[p]That the whole life of Athens were in this!
[p]Thus would I eat it.

"First mend my company, take away thyself.
"
"So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.
"
"'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;
[p]if not, I would it were.
"
"What wouldst thou have to Athens?
"
"Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
[p]Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.
"
"Here is no use for gold.
"
"The best and truest;
[p]For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.
"
"Where liest o' nights, Timon?
"
"Under that's above me.
[p]Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?
"
"Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat
[p]it.
"
"Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!
"
"Where wouldst thou send it?
"
"To sauce thy dishes.
"
"The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
[p]extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
[p]and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much
[p]curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art
[p]despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for
[p]thee, eat it.
"
"On what I hate I feed not.
"
"Dost hate a medlar?
"
"Ay, though it look like thee.
"
"An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst
[p]have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
[p]ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
"
"Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou
[p]ever know beloved?
"
"Myself.
"
"I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a
[p]dog.
"
"What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
[p]to thy flatterers?
"
"Women nearest; but men, men are the things
[p]themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,
[p]Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?
"
"Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
"
"Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
[p]men, and remain a beast with the beasts?
"
"Ay, Timon.
"
"A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'
[p]attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would
[p]beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would
[p]eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would
[p]suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by
[p]the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would
[p]torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a
[p]breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy
[p]greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst
[p]hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
[p]unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and
[p]make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
[p]thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:
[p]wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the
[p]leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to
[p]the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
[p]thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
[p]defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
[p]were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
[p]thou already, that seest not thy loss in
[p]transformation!
"
"If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou
[p]mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of
[p]Athens is become a forest of beasts.
"
"How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?
"
"Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of
[p]company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
[p]and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll
[p]see thee again.
"
"When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be
[p]welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
"
"Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
"
"Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
"
"A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
"
"All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
"
"There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
"
"If I name thee.
[p]I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
"
"I would my tongue could rot them off!
"
"Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
[p]Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
[p]I swound to see thee.
"
"Would thou wouldst burst!
"
"Away,
[p]Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
[p]A stone by thee.
"
"Beast!
"
"Slave!
"
"Toad!
"
"Rogue, rogue, rogue!
[p]I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
[p]But even the mere necessities upon 't.
[p]Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
[p]Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
[p]Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
[p]That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
[p][To the gold]
[p]O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
[p]'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
[p]Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
[p]Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
[p]Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
[p]That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
[p]That solder'st close impossibilities,
[p]And makest them kiss! that speak'st with
[p]every tongue,
[p]To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
[p]Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
[p]Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
[p]May have the world in empire!
"
"Would 'twere so!
[p]But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:
[p]Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.
"
"Throng'd to!
"
"Ay.
"
"Thy back, I prithee.
"
"Live, and love thy misery.
"
"Long live so, and so die.
[p][Exit APEMANTUS]
[p]I am quit.
[p]Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.
"
"Where should he have this gold? It is some poor
[p]fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the
[p]mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his
[p]friends, drove him into this melancholy.
"
"It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
"
"Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not
[p]for't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously
[p]reserve it, how shall's get it?
"
"True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.
"
"Is not this he?
"
"Where?
"
"'Tis his description.
"
"He; I know him.
"
"Save thee, Timon.
"
"Now, thieves?
"
"Soldiers, not thieves.
"
"Both too; and women's sons.
"
"We are not thieves, but men that much do want.
"
"Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
[p]Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
[p]Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
[p]The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
[p]The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
[p]Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
"
"We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
[p]As beasts and birds and fishes.
"
"Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
[p]You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
[p]That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
[p]In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
[p]In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
[p]Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
[p]Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
[p]And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
[p]His antidotes are poison, and he slays
[p]Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
[p]Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
[p]Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
[p]The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
[p]Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
[p]And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
[p]The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
[p]The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
[p]That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
[p]From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
[p]The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
[p]Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
[p]Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
[p]All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
[p]Break open shops; nothing can you steal,
[p]But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
[p]I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.
"
"Has almost charmed me from my profession, by
[p]persuading me to it.
"
"'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
[p]us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.
"
"I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.
"
"Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time
[p]so miserable but a man may be true.
"
"O you gods!
[p]Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
[p]Full of decay and failing? O monument
[p]And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
[p]What an alteration of honour
[p]Has desperate want made!
[p]What viler thing upon the earth than friends
[p]Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
[p]How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
[p]When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
[p]Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
[p]Those that would mischief me than those that do!
[p]Has caught me in his eye: I will present
[p]My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,
[p]Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!
"
"Away! what art thou?
"
"Have you forgot me, sir?
"
"Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
[p]Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.
"
"An honest poor servant of yours.
"
"Then I know thee not:
[p]I never had honest man about me, I; all
[p]I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
"
"The gods are witness,
[p]Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
[p]For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
"
"What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I
[p]love thee,
[p]Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
[p]Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
[p]But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
[p]Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!
"
"I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
[p]To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
[p]To entertain me as your steward still.
"
"Had I a steward
[p]So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
[p]It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
[p]Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
[p]Was born of woman.
[p]Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
[p]You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
[p]One honest man--mistake me not--but one;
[p]No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.
[p]How fain would I have hated all mankind!
[p]And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
[p]I fell with curses.
[p]Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
[p]For, by oppressing and betraying me,
[p]Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
[p]For many so arrive at second masters,
[p]Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
[p]For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--
[p]Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
[p]If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
[p]Expecting in return twenty for one?
"
"No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
[p]Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:
[p]You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
[p]Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
[p]That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
[p]Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,
[p]Care of your food and living; and, believe it,
[p]My most honour'd lord,
[p]For any benefit that points to me,
[p]Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
[p]For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
[p]To requite me, by making rich yourself.
"
"Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
[p]Here, take: the gods out of my misery
[p]Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
[p]But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
[p]Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
[p]But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
[p]Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
[p]What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
[p]Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
[p]blasted woods,
[p]And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
[p]And so farewell and thrive.
"
"O, let me stay,
[p]And comfort you, my master.
"
"If thou hatest curses,
[p]Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:
[p]Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.
"
"As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where
[p]he abides.
"
"What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
[p]for true, that he's so full of gold?
"
"Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and
[p]Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
[p]straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
[p]he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
"
"Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
"
"Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
[p]again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore
[p]'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this
[p]supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
[p]us; and is very likely to load our purposes with
[p]what they travail for, if it be a just true report
[p]that goes of his having.
"
"What have you now to present unto him?
"
"Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will
[p]promise him an excellent piece.
"
"I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent
[p]that's coming toward him.
"
"Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the
[p]time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
[p]performance is ever the duller for his act; and,
[p]but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the
[p]deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
[p]most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
[p]of will or testament which argues a great sickness
[p]in his judgment that makes it.
"
"[Aside] Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a
[p]man so bad as is thyself.
"
"I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for
[p]him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire
[p]against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery
[p]of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.
"
"[Aside] Must thou needs stand for a villain in
[p]thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
[p]other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.
"
"Nay, let's seek him:
[p]Then do we sin against our own estate,
[p]When we may profit meet, and come too late.
"
"True;
[p]When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,
[p]Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.
"
"[Aside] I'll meet you at the turn. What a
[p]god's gold,
[p]That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
[p]Than where swine feed!
[p]'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
[p]Settlest admired reverence in a slave:
[p]To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
[p]Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!
[p]Fit I meet them.
"
"Hail, worthy Timon!
"
"Our late noble master!
"
"Have I once lived to see two honest men?
"
"Sir,
[p]Having often of your open bounty tasted,
[p]Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,
[p]Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!--
[p]Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:
[p]What! to you,
[p]Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
[p]To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover
[p]The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
[p]With any size of words.
"
"Let it go naked, men may see't the better:
[p]You that are honest, by being what you are,
[p]Make them best seen and known.
"
"He and myself
[p]Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,
[p]And sweetly felt it.
"
"Ay, you are honest men.
"
"We are hither come to offer you our service.
"
"Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
[p]Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.
"
"What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.
"
"Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;
[p]I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.
"
"So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore
[p]Came not my friend nor I.
"
"Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
[p]Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;
[p]Thou counterfeit'st most lively.
"
"So, so, my lord.
"
"E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,
[p]Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
[p]That thou art even natural in thine art.
[p]But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,
[p]I must needs say you have a little fault:
[p]Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
[p]You take much pains to mend.
"
"Beseech your honour
[p]To make it known to us.
"
"You'll take it ill.
"
"Most thankfully, my lord.
"
"Will you, indeed?
"
"Doubt it not, worthy lord.
"
"There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,
[p]That mightily deceives you.
"
"Do we, my lord?
"
"Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
[p]Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
[p]Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured
[p]That he's a made-up villain.
"
"I know none such, my lord.
"
"Nor I.
"
"Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
[p]Rid me these villains from your companies:
[p]Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
[p]Confound them by some course, and come to me,
[p]I'll give you gold enough.
"
"Name them, my lord, let's know them.
"
"You that way and you this, but two in company;
[p]Each man apart, all single and alone,
[p]Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
[p]If where thou art two villains shall not be,
[p]Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside
[p]But where one villain is, then him abandon.
[p]Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:
[p][To Painter]
[p]You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!
[p][To Poet]
[p]You are an alchemist; make gold of that.
[p]Out, rascal dogs!
"
"It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;
[p]For he is set so only to himself
[p]That nothing but himself which looks like man
[p]Is friendly with him.
"
"Bring us to his cave:
[p]It is our part and promise to the Athenians
[p]To speak with Timon.
"
"At all times alike
[p]Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
[p]That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,
[p]Offering the fortunes of his former days,
[p]The former man may make him. Bring us to him,
[p]And chance it as it may.
"
"Here is his cave.
[p]Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
[p]Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,
[p]By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:
[p]Speak to them, noble Timon.
"
"Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and
[p]be hang'd:
[p]For each true word, a blister! and each false
[p]Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,
[p]Consuming it with speaking!
"
"Worthy Timon,--
"
"Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.
"
"The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.
"
"I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
[p]Could I but catch it for them.
"
"O, forget
[p]What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
[p]The senators with one consent of love
[p]Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
[p]On special dignities, which vacant lie
[p]For thy best use and wearing.
"
"They confess
[p]Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:
[p]Which now the public body, which doth seldom
[p]Play the recanter, feeling in itself
[p]A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
[p]Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
[p]And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,
[p]Together with a recompense more fruitful
[p]Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
[p]Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
[p]As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
[p]And write in thee the figures of their love,
[p]Ever to read them thine.
"
"You witch me in it;
[p]Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
[p]Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
[p]And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.
"
"Therefore, so please thee to return with us
[p]And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
[p]The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
[p]Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
[p]Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
[p]Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
[p]Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
[p]His country's peace.
"
"And shakes his threatening sword
[p]Against the walls of Athens.
"
"Therefore, Timon,--
"
"Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:
[p]If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
[p]Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
[p]That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,
[p]And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
[p]Giving our holy virgins to the stain
[p]Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,
[p]Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
[p]In pity of our aged and our youth,
[p]I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
[p]And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
[p]While you have throats to answer: for myself,
[p]There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
[p]But I do prize it at my love before
[p]The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
[p]To the protection of the prosperous gods,
[p]As thieves to keepers.
"
"Stay not, all's in vain.
"
"Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
[p]it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
[p]Of health and living now begins to mend,
[p]And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
[p]Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
[p]And last so long enough!
"
"We speak in vain.
"
"But yet I love my country, and am not
[p]One that rejoices in the common wreck,
[p]As common bruit doth put it.
"
"That's well spoke.
"
"Commend me to my loving countrymen,--
"
"These words become your lips as they pass
[p]thorough them.
"
"And enter in our ears like great triumphers
[p]In their applauding gates.
"
"Commend me to them,
[p]And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
[p]Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
[p]Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
[p]That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
[p]In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
[p]I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.
"
"I like this well; he will return again.
"
"I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
[p]That mine own use invites me to cut down,
[p]And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,
[p]Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree
[p]From high to low throughout, that whoso please
[p]To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
[p]Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
[p]And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.
"
"Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.
"
"Come not to me again: but say to Athens,
[p]Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
[p]Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
[p]Who once a day with his embossed froth
[p]The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
[p]And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
[p]Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
[p]What is amiss plague and infection mend!
[p]Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
[p]Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.
"
"His discontents are unremoveably
[p]Coupled to nature.
"
"Our hope in him is dead: let us return,
[p]And strain what other means is left unto us
[p]In our dear peril.
"
"It requires swift foot.
"
"Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
[p]As full as thy report?
"
"have spoke the least:
[p]Besides, his expedition promises
[p]Present approach.
"
"We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.
"
"I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;
[p]Whom, though in general part we were opposed,
[p]Yet our old love made a particular force,
[p]And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
[p]From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
[p]With letters of entreaty, which imported
[p]His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
[p]In part for his sake moved.
"
"Here come our brothers.
"
"No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
[p]The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring
[p]Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:
[p]Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.
"
"By all description this should be the place.
[p]Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?
[p]Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
[p]Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.
[p]Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
[p]I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
[p]Our captain hath in every figure skill,
[p]An aged interpreter, though young in days:
[p]Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
[p]Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.
"
"Sound to this coward and lascivious town
[p]Our terrible approach.
[p][A parley sounded]
[p][Enter Senators on the walls]
[p]Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
[p]With all licentious measure, making your wills
[p]The scope of justice; till now myself and such
[p]As slept within the shadow of your power
[p]Have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
[p]Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,
[p]When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
[p]Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong
[p]Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
[p]And pursy insolence shall break his wind
[p]With fear and horrid flight.
"
"Noble and young,
[p]When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
[p]Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
[p]We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
[p]To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
[p]Above their quantity.
"
"So did we woo
[p]Transformed Timon to our city's love
[p]By humble message and by promised means:
[p]We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
[p]The common stroke of war.
"
"These walls of ours
[p]Were not erected by their hands from whom
[p]You have received your griefs; nor are they such
[p]That these great towers, trophies and schools
[p]should fall
[p]For private faults in them.
"
"Nor are they living
[p]Who were the motives that you first went out;
[p]Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess
[p]Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
[p]Into our city with thy banners spread:
[p]By decimation, and a tithed death--
[p]If thy revenges hunger for that food
[p]Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,
[p]And by the hazard of the spotted die
[p]Let die the spotted.
"
"All have not offended;
[p]For those that were, it is not square to take
[p]On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
[p]Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
[p]Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
[p]Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
[p]Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
[p]With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
[p]Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,
[p]But kill not all together.
"
"What thou wilt,
[p]Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
[p]Than hew to't with thy sword.
"
"Set but thy foot
[p]Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;
[p]So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
[p]To say thou'lt enter friendly.
"
"Throw thy glove,
[p]Or any token of thine honour else,
[p]That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
[p]And not as our confusion, all thy powers
[p]Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
[p]Have seal'd thy full desire.
"
"Then there's my glove;
[p]Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
[p]Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
[p]Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
[p]Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears
[p]With my more noble meaning, not a man
[p]Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
[p]Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
[p]But shall be render'd to your public laws
[p]At heaviest answer.
"
"'Tis most nobly spoken.
"
"Descend, and keep your words.
"
"My noble general, Timon is dead;
[p]Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;
[p]And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
[p]With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
[p]Interprets for my poor ignorance.
"
"[Reads the epitaph] 'Here lies a
[p]wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:
[p]Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
[p]caitiffs left!
[p]Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:
[p]Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay
[p]not here thy gait.'
[p]These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
[p]Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
[p]Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
[p]droplets which
[p]From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
[p]Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
[p]On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
[p]Is noble Timon: of whose memory
[p]Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
[p]And I will use the olive with my sword,
[p]Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
[p]Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
[p]Let our drums strike.
"
"Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
[p]Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
[p]And, countrymen, my loving followers,
[p]Plead my successive title with your swords:
[p]I am his first-born son, that was the last
[p]That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
[p]Then let my father's honours live in me,
[p]Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
"
"Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,
[p]If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
[p]Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
[p]Keep then this passage to the Capitol
[p]And suffer not dishonour to approach
[p]The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
[p]To justice, continence and nobility;
[p]But let desert in pure election shine,
[p]And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
"
"Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
[p]Ambitiously for rule and empery,
[p]Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
[p]A special party, have, by common voice,
[p]In election for the Roman empery,
[p]Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
[p]For many good and great deserts to Rome:
[p]A nobler man, a braver warrior,
[p]Lives not this day within the city walls:
[p]He by the senate is accit'd home
[p]From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
[p]That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,
[p]Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
[p]Ten years are spent since first he undertook
[p]This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
[p]Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd
[p]Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
[p]In coffins from the field;
[p]And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,
[p]Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
[p]Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
[p]Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
[p]Whom worthily you would have now succeed.
[p]And in the Capitol and senate's right,
[p]Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
[p]That you withdraw you and abate your strength;
[p]Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,
[p]Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
"
"How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
"
"Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally
[p]In thy uprightness and integrity,
[p]And so I love and honour thee and thine,
[p]Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
[p]And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
[p]Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
[p]That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
[p]And to my fortunes and the people's favor
[p]Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
"
"Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
[p]I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
[p]And to the love and favor of my country
[p]Commit myself, my person and the cause.
[p][Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS]
[p]Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
[p]As I am confident and kind to thee.
[p]Open the gates, and let me in.
"
"Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
"
"Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.
[p]Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
[p]Successful in the battles that he fights,
[p]With honour and with fortune is return'd
[p]From where he circumscribed with his sword,
[p]And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.
[p][Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and]
[p]MUTIUS; After them, two Men bearing a coffin
[p]covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After
[p]them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with
[p]ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,
[p]prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The
[p]Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks]
"
"Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
[p]Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
[p]Returns with precious jading to the bay
[p]From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
[p]Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
[p]To re-salute his country with his tears,
[p]Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
[p]Thou great defender of this Capitol,
[p]Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
[p]Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
[p]Half of the number that King Priam had,
[p]Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
[p]These that survive let Rome reward with love;
[p]These that I bring unto their latest home,
[p]With burial amongst their ancestors:
[p]Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
[p]Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
[p]Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
[p]To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
[p]Make way to lay them by their brethren.
[p][The tomb is opened]
[p]There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
[p]And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
[p]O sacred receptacle of my joys,
[p]Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
[p]How many sons of mine hast thou in store,
[p]That thou wilt never render to me more!
"
"Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
[p]That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
[p]Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,
[p]Before this earthy prison of their bones;
[p]That so the shadows be not unappeased,
[p]Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
"
"I give him you, the noblest that survives,
[p]The eldest son of this distressed queen.
"
"Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,
[p]Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
[p]A mother's tears in passion for her son:
[p]And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
[p]O, think my son to be as dear to me!
[p]Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
[p]To beautify thy triumphs and return,
[p]Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
[p]But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,
[p]For valiant doings in their country's cause?
[p]O, if to fight for king and commonweal
[p]Were piety in thine, it is in these.
[p]Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:
[p]Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
[p]Draw near them then in being merciful:
[p]Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
[p]Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
"
"Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
[p]These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld
[p]Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
[p]Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
[p]To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,
[p]To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
"
"Away with him! and make a fire straight;
[p]And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
[p]Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.
"
"O cruel, irreligious piety!
"
"Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?
"
"Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
[p]Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive
[p]To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.
[p]Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal
[p]The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
[p]With opportunity of sharp revenge
[p]Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
[p]May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--
[p]When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--
[p]To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
[p][Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with]
[p]their swords bloody]
"
"See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
[p]Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
[p]And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
[p]Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.
[p]Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,
[p]And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
"
"Let it be so; and let Andronicus
[p]Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
[p][Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb]
[p]In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
[p]Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
[p]Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
[p]Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
[p]Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,
[p]No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
[p]In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!
"
"In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
[p]My noble lord and father, live in fame!
[p]Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
[p]I render, for my brethren's obsequies;
[p]And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,
[p]Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:
[p]O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,
[p]Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!
"
"Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved
[p]The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
[p]Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
[p]And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
[p][Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes;]
[p]re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS, attended]
"
"Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
[p]Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
"
"Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.
"
"And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
[p]You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
[p]Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,
[p]That in your country's service drew your swords:
[p]But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,
[p]That hath aspired to Solon's happiness
[p]And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
[p]Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
[p]Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
[p]Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
[p]This palliament of white and spotless hue;
[p]And name thee in election for the empire,
[p]With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:
[p]Be candidatus then, and put it on,
[p]And help to set a head on headless Rome.
"
"A better head her glorious body fits
[p]Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:
[p]What should I don this robe, and trouble you?
[p]Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
[p]To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
[p]And set abroad new business for you all?
[p]Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
[p]And led my country's strength successfully,
[p]And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
[p]Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
[p]In right and service of their noble country
[p]Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
[p]But not a sceptre to control the world:
[p]Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
"
"Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
"
"Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
"
"Patience, Prince Saturninus.
"
"Romans, do me right:
[p]Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not
[p]Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
[p]Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,
[p]Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
"
"Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
[p]That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
"
"Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee
[p]The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
"
"Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
[p]But honour thee, and will do till I die:
[p]My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
[p]I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
[p]Of noble minds is honourable meed.
"
"People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,
[p]I ask your voices and your suffrages:
[p]Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
"
"To gratify the good Andronicus,
[p]And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
[p]The people will accept whom he admits.
"
"Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,
[p]That you create your emperor's eldest son,
[p]Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
[p]Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
[p]And ripen justice in this commonweal:
[p]Then, if you will elect by my advice,
[p]Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'
"
"With voices and applause of every sort,
[p]Patricians and plebeians, we create
[p]Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,
[p]And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
"
"Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done
[p]To us in our election this day,
[p]I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
[p]And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
[p]And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
[p]Thy name and honourable family,
[p]Lavinia will I make my empress,
[p]Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
[p]And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:
[p]Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
"
"It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match
[p]I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:
[p]And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,
[p]King and commander of our commonweal,
[p]The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate
[p]My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;
[p]Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:
[p]Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
[p]Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
"
"Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
[p]How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
[p]Rome shall record, and when I do forget
[p]The least of these unspeakable deserts,
[p]Romans, forget your fealty to me.
"
"[To TAMORA] Now, madam, are you prisoner to
[p]an emperor;
[p]To him that, for your honour and your state,
[p]Will use you nobly and your followers.
"
"A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
[p]That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
[p]Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
[p]Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
[p]Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:
[p]Princely shall be thy usage every way.
[p]Rest on my word, and let not discontent
[p]Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you
[p]Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
[p]Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
"
"Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
[p]Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
"
"Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;
[p]Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
[p]Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
"
"Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
"
"How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?
"
"Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal
[p]To do myself this reason and this right.
"
"'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:
[p]This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
"
"And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.
"
"Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?
[p]Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
"
"Surprised! by whom?
"
"By him that justly may
[p]Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.
"
"Brothers, help to convey her hence away,
[p]And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
"
"Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
"
"My lord, you pass not here.
"
"What, villain boy!
[p]Barr'st me my way in Rome?
"
"Help, Lucius, help!
[p][Dies]
[p][During the fray, SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS,]
[p]CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter, above]
"
"My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,
[p]In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
"
"Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;
[p]My sons would never so dishonour me:
[p]Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.
"
"Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
[p]That is another's lawful promised love.
"
"No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,
[p]Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
[p]I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;
[p]Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
[p]Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
[p]Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,
[p]But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
[p]Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,
[p]That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
"
"O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
"
"But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
[p]To him that flourish'd for her with his sword
[p]A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
[p]One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
[p]To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
"
"These words are razors to my wounded heart.
"
"And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,
[p]That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs
[p]Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
[p]If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,
[p]Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,
[p]And will create thee empress of Rome,
[p]Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
[p]And here I swear by all the Roman gods,
[p]Sith priest and holy water are so near
[p]And tapers burn so bright and every thing
[p]In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,
[p]I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
[p]Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
[p]I lead espoused my bride along with me.
"
"And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,
[p]If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
[p]She will a handmaid be to his desires,
[p]A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
"
"Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany
[p]Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,
[p]Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
[p]Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:
[p]There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
"
"I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
[p]Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
[p]Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?
"
"O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
[p]In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
"
"No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
[p]Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
[p]That hath dishonour'd all our family;
[p]Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!
"
"But let us give him burial, as becomes;
[p]Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
"
"Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:
[p]This monument five hundred years hath stood,
[p]Which I have sumptuously re-edified:
[p]Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
[p]Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
[p]Bury him where you can; he comes not here.
"
"My lord, this is impiety in you:
[p]My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him
[p]He must be buried with his brethren.
"
"And shall, or him we will accompany.
"
"'And shall!' what villain was it that spake
[p]that word?
"
"He that would vouch it in any place but here.
"
"What, would you bury him in my despite?
"
"No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
[p]To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
"
"Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
[p]And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:
[p]My foes I do repute you every one;
[p]So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.
"
"He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
"
"Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
"
"Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--
"
"Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--
"
"Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
"
"Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--
"
"Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--
"
"Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
[p]His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
[p]That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
[p]Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:
[p]The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
[p]That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
[p]Did graciously plead for his funerals:
[p]Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy
[p]Be barr'd his entrance here.
"
"Rise, Marcus, rise.
[p]The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,
[p]To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!
[p]Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
"
"There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
[p]Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
"
"[Kneeling] No man shed tears for noble Mutius;
[p]He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
"
"My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,
[p]How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
[p]Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?
"
"I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,
[p]Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:
[p]Is she not then beholding to the man
[p]That brought her for this high good turn so far?
[p]Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
[p][Flourish. Re-enter, from one side, SATURNINUS]
[p]attended, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON; from
[p]the other, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, and others]
"
"So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
[p]God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!
"
"And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
[p]Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.
"
"Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
[p]Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
"
"Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
[p]My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?
[p]But let the laws of Rome determine all;
[p]Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.
"
"'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;
[p]But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.
"
"My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
[p]Answer I must and shall do with my life.
[p]Only thus much I give your grace to know:
[p]By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
[p]This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
[p]Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;
[p]That in the rescue of Lavinia
[p]With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
[p]In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
[p]To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
[p]Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,
[p]That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
[p]A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
"
"Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
[p]'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.
[p]Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
[p]How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!
"
"My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
[p]Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
[p]Then hear me speak in indifferently for all;
[p]And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
"
"What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,
[p]And basely put it up without revenge?
"
"Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend
[p]I should be author to dishonour you!
[p]But on mine honour dare I undertake
[p]For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;
[p]Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:
[p]Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;
[p]Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
[p]Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
[p][Aside to SATURNINUS] My lord, be ruled by me,]
[p]be won at last;
[p]Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
[p]You are but newly planted in your throne;
[p]Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,
[p]Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
[p]And so supplant you for ingratitude,
[p]Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
[p]Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:
[p]I'll find a day to massacre them all
[p]And raze their faction and their family,
[p]The cruel father and his traitorous sons,
[p]To whom I sued for my dear son's life,
[p]And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
[p]Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.
[p][Aloud]
[p]Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;
[p]Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
[p]That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
"
"Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.
"
"I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:
[p]These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.
"
"Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
[p]A Roman now adopted happily,
[p]And must advise the emperor for his good.
[p]This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
[p]And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
[p]That I have reconciled your friends and you.
[p]For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd
[p]My word and promise to the emperor,
[p]That you will be more mild and tractable.
[p]And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia;
[p]By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
[p]You shall ask pardon of his majesty.
"
"We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,
[p]That what we did was mildly as we might,
[p]Tendering our sister's honour and our own.
"
"That, on mine honour, here I do protest.
"
"Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
"
"Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:
[p]The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;
[p]I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
"
"Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,
[p]And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
[p]I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.
[p]Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
[p]I found a friend, and sure as death I swore
[p]I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
[p]Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,
[p]You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
[p]This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
"
"To-morrow, an it please your majesty
[p]To hunt the panther and the hart with me,
[p]With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.
"
"Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.
"
"Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
[p]Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
[p]Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;
[p]Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.
[p]As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
[p]And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
[p]Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,
[p]And overlooks the highest-peering hills;
[p]So Tamora:
[p]Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
[p]And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
[p]Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,
[p]To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
[p]And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long
[p]Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains
[p]And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
[p]Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
[p]Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
[p]I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,
[p]To wait upon this new-made empress.
[p]To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,
[p]This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
[p]This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
[p]And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
[p]Holloa! what storm is this?
"
"Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,
[p]And manners, to intrude where I am graced;
[p]And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.
"
"Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;
[p]And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
[p]'Tis not the difference of a year or two
[p]Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
[p]I am as able and as fit as thou
[p]To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;
[p]And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
[p]And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
"
"[Aside] Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep
[p]the peace.
"
"Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,
[p]Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
[p]Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?
[p]Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
[p]Till you know better how to handle it.
"
"Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
[p]Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
"
"Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?
"
"[Coming forward] Why, how now, lords!
[p]So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,
[p]And maintain such a quarrel openly?
[p]Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
[p]I would not for a million of gold
[p]The cause were known to them it most concerns;
[p]Nor would your noble mother for much more
[p]Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.
[p]For shame, put up.
"
"Not I, till I have sheathed
[p]My rapier in his bosom and withal
[p]Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
[p]That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.
"
"For that I am prepared and full resolved.
[p]Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,
[p]And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!
"
"Away, I say!
[p]Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
[p]This petty brabble will undo us all.
[p]Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
[p]It is to jet upon a prince's right?
[p]What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
[p]Or Bassianus so degenerate,
[p]That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
[p]Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
[p]Young lords, beware! and should the empress know
[p]This discord's ground, the music would not please.
"
"I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
[p]I love Lavinia more than all the world.
"
"Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
[p]Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
"
"Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome
[p]How furious and impatient they be,
[p]And cannot brook competitors in love?
[p]I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
[p]By this device.
"
"Aaron, a thousand deaths
[p]Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
"
"To achieve her! how?
"
"Why makest thou it so strange?
[p]She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
[p]She is a woman, therefore may be won;
[p]She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
[p]What, man! more water glideth by the mill
[p]Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
[p]Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:
[p]Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.
[p]Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
"
"[Aside] Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
"
"Then why should he despair that knows to court it
[p]With words, fair looks and liberality?
[p]What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
[p]And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
"
"Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so
[p]Would serve your turns.
"
"Ay, so the turn were served.
"
"Aaron, thou hast hit it.
"
"Would you had hit it too!
[p]Then should not we be tired with this ado.
[p]Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools
[p]To square for this? would it offend you, then
[p]That both should speed?
"
"Faith, not me.
"
"Nor me, so I were one.
"
"For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:
[p]'Tis policy and stratagem must do
[p]That you affect; and so must you resolve,
[p]That what you cannot as you would achieve,
[p]You must perforce accomplish as you may.
[p]Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
[p]Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
[p]A speedier course than lingering languishment
[p]Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
[p]My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
[p]There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
[p]The forest walks are wide and spacious;
[p]And many unfrequented plots there are
[p]Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
[p]Single you thither then this dainty doe,
[p]And strike her home by force, if not by words:
[p]This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
[p]Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
[p]To villany and vengeance consecrate,
[p]Will we acquaint with all that we intend;
[p]And she shall file our engines with advice,
[p]That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
[p]But to your wishes' height advance you both.
[p]The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
[p]The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:
[p]The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
[p]There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take
[p]your turns;
[p]There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,
[p]And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
"
"Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,
"
"Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
[p]To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.
[p]Per Styga, per manes vehor.
"
"The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
[p]The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:
[p]Uncouple here and let us make a bay
[p]And wake the emperor and his lovely bride
[p]And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,
[p]That all the court may echo with the noise.
[p]Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
[p]To attend the emperor's person carefully:
[p]I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
[p]But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.
[p][A cry of hounds and horns, winded in a peal. Enter]
[p]SATURNINUS, TAMORA, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, DEMETRIUS,
[p]CHIRON, and Attendants]
[p]Many good morrows to your majesty;
[p]Madam, to you as many and as good:
[p]I promised your grace a hunter's peal.
"
"And you have rung it lustily, my lord;
[p]Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.
"
"Lavinia, how say you?
"
"I say, no;
[p]I have been broad awake two hours and more.
"
"Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,
[p]And to our sport.
[p][To TAMORA]
[p]Madam, now shall ye see
[p]Our Roman hunting.
"
"I have dogs, my lord,
[p]Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
[p]And climb the highest promontory top.
"
"And I have horse will follow where the game
[p]Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.
"
"Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
[p]But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.
"
"He that had wit would think that I had none,
[p]To bury so much gold under a tree,
[p]And never after to inherit it.
[p]Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
[p]Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
[p]Which, cunningly effected, will beget
[p]A very excellent piece of villany:
[p]And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
[p][Hides the gold]
[p]That have their alms out of the empress' chest.
"
"My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,
[p]When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
[p]The birds chant melody on every bush,
[p]The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,
[p]The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
[p]And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:
[p]Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
[p]And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
[p]Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
[p]As if a double hunt were heard at once,
[p]Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
[p]And, after conflict such as was supposed
[p]The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,
[p]When with a happy storm they were surprised
[p]And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,
[p]We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
[p]Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;
[p]Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
[p]Be unto us as is a nurse's song
[p]Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
"
"Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
[p]Saturn is dominator over mine:
[p]What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
[p]My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
[p]My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
[p]Even as an adder when she doth unroll
[p]To do some fatal execution?
[p]No, madam, these are no venereal signs:
[p]Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
[p]Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
[p]Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,
[p]Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
[p]This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
[p]His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
[p]Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
[p]And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
[p]Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,
[p]And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
[p]Now question me no more; we are espied;
[p]Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
[p]Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
"
"Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
"
"No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:
[p]Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons
[p]To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.
"
"Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,
[p]Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
[p]Or is it Dian, habited like her,
[p]Who hath abandoned her holy groves
[p]To see the general hunting in this forest?
"
"Saucy controller of our private steps!
[p]Had I the power that some say Dian had,
[p]Thy temples should be planted presently
[p]With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
[p]Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
[p]Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
"
"Under your patience, gentle empress,
[p]'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;
[p]And to be doubted that your Moor and you
[p]Are singled forth to try experiments:
[p]Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
[p]'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
"
"Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian
[p]Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
[p]Spotted, detested, and abominable.
[p]Why are you sequester'd from all your train,
[p]Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
[p]And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,
[p]Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
[p]If foul desire had not conducted you?
"
"And, being intercepted in your sport,
[p]Great reason that my noble lord be rated
[p]For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,
[p]And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;
[p]This valley fits the purpose passing well.
"
"The king my brother shall have note of this.
"
"Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:
[p]Good king, to be so mightily abused!
"
"Why have I patience to endure all this?
"
"How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
[p]Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
"
"Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
[p]These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:
[p]A barren detested vale, you see it is;
[p]The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
[p]O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
[p]Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
[p]Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
[p]And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
[p]They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
[p]A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
[p]Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
[p]Would make such fearful and confused cries
[p]As any mortal body hearing it
[p]Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
[p]No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
[p]But straight they told me they would bind me here
[p]Unto the body of a dismal yew,
[p]And leave me to this miserable death:
[p]And then they call'd me foul adulteress,
[p]Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
[p]That ever ear did hear to such effect:
[p]And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,
[p]This vengeance on me had they executed.
[p]Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
[p]Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
"
"This is a witness that I am thy son.
"
"And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
"
"Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,
[p]For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
"
"Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys
[p]Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
"
"Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;
[p]First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:
[p]This minion stood upon her chastity,
[p]Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
[p]And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:
[p]And shall she carry this unto her grave?
"
"An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
[p]Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
[p]And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
"
"But when ye have the honey ye desire,
[p]Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
"
"I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.
[p]Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
[p]That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
"
"O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--
"
"I will not hear her speak; away with her!
"
"Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
"
"Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
[p]To see her tears; but be your heart to them
[p]As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
"
"When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
[p]O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;
[p]The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;
[p]Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
[p]Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
[p][To CHIRON]
[p]Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.
"
"What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
"
"'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:
[p]Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
[p]The lion moved with pity did endure
[p]To have his princely paws pared all away:
[p]Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
[p]The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
[p]O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
[p]Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!
"
"I know not what it means; away with her!
"
"O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
[p]That gave thee life, when well he might have
[p]slain thee,
[p]Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.
"
"Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
[p]Even for his sake am I pitiless.
[p]Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
[p]To save your brother from the sacrifice;
[p]But fierce Andronicus would not relent;
[p]Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,
[p]The worse to her, the better loved of me.
"
"O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,
[p]And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
[p]For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
[p]Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
"
"What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go.
"
"'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more
[p]That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
[p]O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
[p]And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
[p]Where never man's eye may behold my body:
[p]Do this, and be a charitable murderer.
"
"So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:
[p]No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.
"
"Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
"
"No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!
[p]The blot and enemy to our general name!
[p]Confusion fall--
"
"Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:
[p]This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
[p][DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the]
[p]pit; then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging
[p]off LAVINIA]
"
"Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.
[p]Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,
[p]Till all the Andronici be made away.
[p]Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
[p]And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.
"
"Come on, my lords, the better foot before:
[p]Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
[p]Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
"
"My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.
"
"And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,
[p]Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
"
"What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,
[p]Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,
[p]Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
[p]As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
[p]A very fatal place it seems to me.
[p]Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
"
"O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt
[p]That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
"
"[Aside] Now will I fetch the king to find them here,
[p]That he thereby may give a likely guess
[p]How these were they that made away his brother.
"
"Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
[p]From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?
"
"I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
[p]A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:
[p]My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
"
"To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
[p]Aaron and thou look down into this den,
[p]And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
"
"Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart
[p]Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
[p]The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;
[p]O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now
[p]Was I a child to fear I know not what.
"
"Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,
[p]All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,
[p]In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
"
"If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
"
"Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
[p]A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,
[p]Which, like a taper in some monument,
[p]Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
[p]And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
[p]So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
[p]When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
[p]O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--
[p]If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--
[p]Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
[p]As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
"
"Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
[p]Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
[p]I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
[p]Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
[p]I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
"
"Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
"
"Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
[p]Till thou art here aloft, or I below:
[p]Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.
"
"Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,
[p]And what he is that now is leap'd into it.
[p]Say who art thou that lately didst descend
[p]Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
"
"The unhappy son of old Andronicus:
[p]Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
[p]To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
"
"My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
[p]He and his lady both are at the lodge
[p]Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
[p]'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
"
"We know not where you left him all alive;
[p]But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.
[p][Re-enter TAMORA, with Attendants; TITUS]
[p]ANDRONICUS, and Lucius]
"
"Where is my lord the king?
"
"Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.
"
"Where is thy brother Bassianus?
"
"Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
[p]Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
"
"Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
[p]The complot of this timeless tragedy;
[p]And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
[p]In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
"
"[Reads] 'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--
[p]Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--
[p]Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:
[p]Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
[p]Among the nettles at the elder-tree
[p]Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
[p]Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
[p]Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
[p]O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
[p]This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
[p]Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
[p]That should have murdered Bassianus here.
"
"My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
"
"[To TITUS] Two of thy whelps, fell curs of
[p]bloody kind,
[p]Have here bereft my brother of his life.
[p]Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:
[p]There let them bide until we have devised
[p]Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
"
"What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
[p]How easily murder is discovered!
"
"High emperor, upon my feeble knee
[p]I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
[p]That this fell fault of my accursed sons,
[p]Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--
"
"If it be proved! you see it is apparent.
[p]Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
"
"Andronicus himself did take it up.
"
"I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
[p]For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow
[p]They shall be ready at your highness' will
[p]To answer their suspicion with their lives.
"
"Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
[p]Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:
[p]Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;
[p]For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
[p]That end upon them should be executed.
"
"Andronicus, I will entreat the king;
[p]Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.
"
"Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.
"
"So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,
[p]Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.
"
"Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
[p]An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
"
"See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.
"
"Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
"
"She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;
[p]And so let's leave her to her silent walks.
"
"An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself.
"
"If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
"
"Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast!
[p]Cousin, a word; where is your husband?
[p]If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
[p]If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
[p]That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
[p]Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
[p]Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
[p]Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,
[p]Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
[p]And might not gain so great a happiness
[p]As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
[p]Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
[p]Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
[p]Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
[p]Coming and going with thy honey breath.
[p]But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
[p]And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
[p]Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
[p]And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
[p]As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
[p]Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
[p]Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
[p]Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
[p]O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
[p]That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!
[p]Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
[p]Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
[p]Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,
[p]And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:
[p]But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
[p]A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
[p]And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
[p]That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
[p]O, had the monster seen those lily hands
[p]Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,
[p]And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
[p]He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
[p]Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony
[p]Which that sweet tongue hath made,
[p]He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep
[p]As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
[p]Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;
[p]For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
[p]One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
[p]What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
[p]Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee
[p]O, could our mourning ease thy misery!
"
"Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!
[p]For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
[p]In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;
[p]For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;
[p]For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;
[p]And for these bitter tears, which now you see
[p]Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;
[p]Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
[p]Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
[p]For two and twenty sons I never wept,
[p]Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
[p][Lieth down; the Judges, &c., pass by him, and Exeunt]
[p]For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write
[p]My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:
[p]Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
[p]My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
[p]O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,
[p]That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
[p]Than youthful April shall with all his showers:
[p]In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
[p]In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
[p]And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
[p]So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
[p][Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn]
[p]O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!
[p]Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;
[p]And let me say, that never wept before,
[p]My tears are now prevailing orators.
"
"O noble father, you lament in vain:
[p]The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;
[p]And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
"
"Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.
[p]Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--
"
"My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
"
"Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,
[p]They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
[p]They would not pity me, yet plead I must;
[p]And bootless unto them [--]
[p]Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
[p]Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
[p]Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
[p]For that they will not intercept my tale:
[p]When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
[p]Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
[p]And, were they but attired in grave weeds,
[p]Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
[p]A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;
[p]A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
[p]And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
[p][Rises]
[p]But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
"
"To rescue my two brothers from their death:
[p]For which attempt the judges have pronounced
[p]My everlasting doom of banishment.
"
"O happy man! they have befriended thee.
[p]Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
[p]That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
[p]Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
[p]But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,
[p]From these devourers to be banished!
[p]But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
"
"Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;
[p]Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:
[p]I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
"
"Will it consume me? let me see it, then.
"
"This was thy daughter.
"
"Why, Marcus, so she is.
"
"Ay me, this object kills me!
"
"Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
[p]Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
[p]Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
[p]What fool hath added water to the sea,
[p]Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
[p]My grief was at the height before thou camest,
[p]And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
[p]Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;
[p]For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
[p]And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;
[p]In bootless prayer have they been held up,
[p]And they have served me to effectless use:
[p]Now all the service I require of them
[p]Is that the one will help to cut the other.
[p]'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
[p]For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.
"
"Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
"
"O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
[p]That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,
[p]Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,
[p]Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung
[p]Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!
"
"O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
"
"O, thus I found her, straying in the park,
[p]Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer
[p]That hath received some unrecuring wound.
"
"It was my deer; and he that wounded her
[p]Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:
[p]For now I stand as one upon a rock
[p]Environed with a wilderness of sea,
[p]Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
[p]Expecting ever when some envious surge
[p]Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
[p]This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
[p]Here stands my other son, a banished man,
[p]And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
[p]But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
[p]Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
[p]Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
[p]It would have madded me: what shall I do
[p]Now I behold thy lively body so?
[p]Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:
[p]Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:
[p]Thy husband he is dead: and for his death
[p]Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
[p]Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!
[p]When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
[p]Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
[p]Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.
"
"Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
[p]Perchance because she knows them innocent.
"
"If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful
[p]Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
[p]No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
[p]Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
[p]Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
[p]Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
[p]Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
[p]And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
[p]Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
[p]How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,
[p]With miry slime left on them by a flood?
[p]And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
[p]Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
[p]And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
[p]Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?
[p]Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
[p]Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
[p]What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,
[p]Plot some deuce of further misery,
[p]To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
"
"Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,
[p]See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
"
"Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
"
"Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot
[p]Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
[p]For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.
"
"Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
"
"Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:
[p]Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
[p]That to her brother which I said to thee:
[p]His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
[p]Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
[p]O, what a sympathy of woe is this,
[p]As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
"
"Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor
[p]Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,
[p]Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
[p]Or any one of you, chop off your hand,
[p]And send it to the king: he for the same
[p]Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;
[p]And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
"
"O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
[p]Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
[p]That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
[p]With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:
[p]Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
"
"Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
[p]That hath thrown down so many enemies,
[p]Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:
[p]My youth can better spare my blood than you;
[p]And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
"
"Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,
[p]And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,
[p]Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
[p]O, none of both but are of high desert:
[p]My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
[p]To ransom my two nephews from their death;
[p]Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
"
"Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
[p]For fear they die before their pardon come.
"
"My hand shall go.
"
"By heaven, it shall not go!
"
"Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these
[p]Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
"
"Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
[p]Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
"
"And, for our father's sake and mother's care,
[p]Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
"
"Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
"
"Then I'll go fetch an axe.
"
"But I will use the axe.
"
"Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:
[p]Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
"
"[Aside] If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
[p]And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:
[p]But I'll deceive you in another sort,
[p]And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass.
"
"Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.
[p]Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:
[p]Tell him it was a hand that warded him
[p]From thousand dangers; bid him bury it
[p]More hath it merited; that let it have.
[p]As for my sons, say I account of them
[p]As jewels purchased at an easy price;
[p]And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.
"
"I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand
[p]Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
[p][Aside]
[p]Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany
[p]Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
[p]Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
[p]Aaron will have his soul black like his face.
"
"O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
[p]And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:
[p]If any power pities wretched tears,
[p]To that I call!
[p][To LAVINIA]
[p]What, wilt thou kneel with me?
[p]Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;
[p]Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,
[p]And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
[p]When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
"
"O brother, speak with possibilities,
[p]And do not break into these deep extremes.
"
"Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
[p]Then be my passions bottomless with them.
"
"But yet let reason govern thy lament.TITUS ANDRONICUS. If there were reason for these miseries,
[p]Then into limits could I bind my woes:
[p]When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
[p]If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
[p]Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?
[p]And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
[p]I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!
[p]She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
[p]Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
[p]Then must my earth with her continual tears
[p]Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
[p]For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
[p]But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
[p]Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
[p]To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
"
"Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
[p]For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.
[p]Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
[p]And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;
[p]Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd;
[p]That woe is me to think upon thy woes
[p]More than remembrance of my father's death.
"
"Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily,
[p]And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
[p]These miseries are more than may be borne.
[p]To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;
[p]But sorrow flouted at is double death.
"
"Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
[p]And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
[p]That ever death should let life bear his name,
[p]Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!
"
"Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
[p]As frozen water to a starved snake.
"
"When will this fearful slumber have an end?
"
"Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;
[p]Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,
[p]Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:
[p]Thy other banish'd son, with this dear sight
[p]Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,
[p]Even like a stony image, cold and numb.
[p]Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:
[p]Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand
[p]Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight
[p]The closing up of our most wretched eyes;
[p]Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?
"
"Ha, ha, ha!
"
"Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.
"
"Why, I have not another tear to shed:
[p]Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
[p]And would usurp upon my watery eyes
[p]And make them blind with tributary tears:
[p]Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
[p]For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
[p]And threat me I shall never come to bliss
[p]Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
[p]Even in their throats that have committed them.
[p]Come, let me see what task I have to do.
[p]You heavy people, circle me about,
[p]That I may turn me to each one of you,
[p]And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
[p]The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;
[p]And in this hand the other I will bear.
[p]Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!
[p]Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
[p]As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;
[p]Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:
[p]Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:
[p]And, if you love me, as I think you do,
[p]Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
"
"Farewell Andronicus, my noble father,
[p]The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome:
[p]Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
[p]He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:
[p]Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
[p]O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
[p]But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
[p]But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
[p]If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;
[p]And make proud Saturnine and his empress
[p]Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.
[p]Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,
[p]To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.
"
"So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more
[p]Than will preserve just so much strength in us
[p]As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
[p]Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:
[p]Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,
[p]And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
[p]With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
[p]Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
[p]Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,
[p]Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
[p]Then thus I thump it down.
[p][To LAVINIA]
[p]Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
[p]When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,
[p]Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
[p]Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;
[p]Or get some little knife between thy teeth,
[p]And just against thy heart make thou a hole;
[p]That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
[p]May run into that sink, and soaking in
[p]Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
"
"Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay
[p]Such violent hands upon her tender life.
"
"How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?
[p]Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
[p]What violent hands can she lay on her life?
[p]Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;
[p]To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,
[p]How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
[p]O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
[p]Lest we remember still that we have none.
[p]Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
[p]As if we should forget we had no hands,
[p]If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
[p]Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
[p]Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
[p]I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
[p]She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
[p]Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:
[p]Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
[p]In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
[p]As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
[p]Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
[p]Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
[p]But I of these will wrest an alphabet
[p]And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.
"
"Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:
[p]Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
"
"Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
[p]Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.
"
"Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
[p]And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
[p][MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife]
[p]What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?
"
"At that that I have kill'd, my lord; a fly.
"
"Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart;
[p]Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:
[p]A deed of death done on the innocent
[p]Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:
[p]I see thou art not for my company.
"
"Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
"
"But how, if that fly had a father and mother?
[p]How would he hang his slender gilded wings,
[p]And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
[p]Poor harmless fly,
[p]That, with his pretty buzzing melody,
[p]Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
[p]kill'd him.
"
"Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor'd fly,
[p]Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.
"
"O, O, O,
[p]Then pardon me for reprehending thee,
[p]For thou hast done a charitable deed.
[p]Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;
[p]Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor
[p]Come hither purposely to poison me.--
[p]There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.
[p]Ah, sirrah!
[p]Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,
[p]But that between us we can kill a fly
[p]That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.
"
"Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
[p]He takes false shadows for true substances.
"
"Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:
[p]I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee
[p]Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
[p]Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
[p]And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.
"
"Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
[p]Follows me every where, I know not why:
[p]Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
[p]Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.
"
"Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
"
"She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
"
"Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
"
"What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
"
"Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:
[p]See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:
[p]Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
[p]Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
[p]Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
[p]Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
"
"Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
"
"My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
[p]Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:
[p]For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,
[p]Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
[p]And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
[p]Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
[p]Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
[p]Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
[p]And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:
[p]Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--
[p]Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:
[p]And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
[p]I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
"
"Lucius, I will.
[p][LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which]
[p]LUCIUS has let fall]
"
"How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
[p]Some book there is that she desires to see.
[p]Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.
[p]But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd
[p]Come, and take choice of all my library,
[p]And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
[p]Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
[p]Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
"
"I think she means that there was more than one
[p]Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;
[p]Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
"
"Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
"
"Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
[p]My mother gave it me.
"
"For love of her that's gone,
[p]Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
"
"Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!
[p][Helping her]
[p]What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
[p]This is the tragic tale of Philomel,
[p]And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
[p]And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.
"
"See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.
"
"Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
[p]Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
[p]Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!
[p]Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--
[p]O, had we never, never hunted there!--
[p]Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
[p]By nature made for murders and for rapes.
"
"O, why should nature build so foul a den,
[p]Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
"
"Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none
[p]but friends,
[p]What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:
[p]Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
[p]That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
"
"Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.
[p]Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
[p]Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
[p]My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:
[p]This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst
[p]This after me, when I have writ my name
[p]Without the help of any hand at all.
[p][He writes his name with his staff, and guides it]
[p]with feet and mouth]
[p]Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
[p]Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,
[p]What God will have discover'd for revenge;
[p]Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
[p]That we may know the traitors and the truth!
[p][She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it]
[p]with her stumps, and writes]
"
"O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?
[p]'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'
"
"What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora
[p]Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?
"
"Magni Dominator poli,
[p]Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
"
"O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know
[p]There is enough written upon this earth
[p]To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
[p]And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
[p]My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
[p]And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
[p]And swear with me, as, with the woful fere
[p]And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,
[p]Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,
[p]That we will prosecute by good advice
[p]Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
[p]And see their blood, or die with this reproach.
"
"'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.
[p]But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:
[p]The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,
[p]She's with the lion deeply still in league,
[p]And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,
[p]And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
[p]You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;
[p]And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
[p]And with a gad of steel will write these words,
[p]And lay it by: the angry northern wind
[p]Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,
[p]And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?
"
"I say, my lord, that if I were a man,
[p]Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe
[p]For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.
"
"Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft
[p]For his ungrateful country done the like.
"
"And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
"
"Come, go with me into mine armoury;
[p]Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
[p]Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons
[p]Presents that I intend to send them both:
[p]Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?
"
"Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
"
"No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
[p]Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:
[p]Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:
[p]Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.
"
"O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,
[p]And not relent, or not compassion him?
[p]Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,
[p]That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
[p]Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;
[p]But yet so just that he will not revenge.
[p]Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!
"
"Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
[p]He hath some message to deliver us.
"
"Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
"
"My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
[p]I greet your honours from Andronicus.
[p][Aside]
[p]And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
"
"Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
"
"[Aside] That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
[p]For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you,
[p]My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me
[p]The goodliest weapons of his armoury
[p]To gratify your honourable youth,
[p]The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;
[p]And so I do, and with his gifts present
[p]Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
[p]You may be armed and appointed well:
[p]And so I leave you both:
[p][Aside]
[p]like bloody villains.
"
"What's here? A scroll; and written round about?
[p]Let's see;

"O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:
[p]I read it in the grammar long ago.
"
"Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.
[p][Aside]
[p]Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
[p]Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;
[p]And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,
[p]That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
[p]But were our witty empress well afoot,
[p]She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
[p]But let her rest in her unrest awhile.
[p]And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
[p]Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
[p]Captives, to be advanced to this height?
[p]It did me good, before the palace gate
[p]To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.
"
"But me more good, to see so great a lord
[p]Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
"
"Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
[p]Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
"
"I would we had a thousand Roman dames
[p]At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.
"
"A charitable wish and full of love.
"
"Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
"
"And that would she for twenty thousand more.
"
"Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods
[p]For our beloved mother in her pains.
"
"[Aside] Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
"
"Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
"
"Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.
"
"Soft! who comes here?
"
"Good morrow, lords:
[p]O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
"
"Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
[p]Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
"
"O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
[p]Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
"
"Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
[p]What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?
"
"O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
[p]Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!
[p]She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.
"
"To whom?
"
"I mean, she is brought a-bed.
"
"Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
"
"A devil.
"
"Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.
"
"A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:
[p]Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
[p]Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:
[p]The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
[p]And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
"
"'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?
[p]Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.
"
"Villain, what hast thou done?
"
"That which thou canst not undo.
"
"Thou hast undone our mother.
"
"Villain, I have done thy mother.
"
"And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.
[p]Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
[p]Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!
"
"It shall not live.
"
"It shall not die.
"
"Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
"
"What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I
[p]Do execution on my flesh and blood.
"
"I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:
[p]Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.
"
"Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
[p][Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws]
[p]Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?
[p]Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
[p]That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
[p]He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
[p]That touches this my first-born son and heir!
[p]I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
[p]With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,
[p]Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
[p]Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
[p]What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
[p]Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
[p]Coal-black is better than another hue,
[p]In that it scorns to bear another hue;
[p]For all the water in the ocean
[p]Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,
[p]Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
[p]Tell the empress from me, I am of age
[p]To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.
"
"Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
"
"My mistress is my mistress; this myself,
[p]The vigour and the picture of my youth:
[p]This before all the world do I prefer;
[p]This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
[p]Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
"
"By this our mother is forever shamed.
"
"Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
"
"The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.
"
"I blush to think upon this ignomy.
"
"Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
[p]Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
[p]The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
[p]Here's a young lad framed of another leer:
[p]Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,
[p]As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'
[p]He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
[p]Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,
[p]And from that womb where you imprison'd were
[p]He is enfranchised and come to light:
[p]Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
[p]Although my seal be stamped in his face.
"
"Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?
"
"Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
[p]And we will all subscribe to thy advice:
[p]Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.
"
"Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
[p]My son and I will have the wind of you:
[p]Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.
"
"How many women saw this child of his?
"
"Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,
[p]I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
[p]The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
[p]The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
[p]But say, again; how many saw the child?
"
"Cornelia the midwife and myself;
[p]And no one else but the deliver'd empress.
"
"The empress, the midwife, and yourself:
[p]Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
[p]Go to the empress, tell her this I said.
[p][He kills the nurse]
[p]Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.
"
"What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?
"
"O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:
[p]Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
[p]A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:
[p]And now be it known to you my full intent.
[p]Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;
[p]His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
[p]His child is like to her, fair as you are:
[p]Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
[p]And tell them both the circumstance of all;
[p]And how by this their child shall be advanced,
[p]And be received for the emperor's heir,
[p]And substituted in the place of mine,
[p]To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
[p]And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
[p]Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,
[p][Pointing to the nurse]
[p]And you must needs bestow her funeral;
[p]The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:
[p]This done, see that you take no longer days,
[p]But send the midwife presently to me.
[p]The midwife and the nurse well made away,
[p]Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
"
"Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
[p]With secrets.
"
"For this care of Tamora,
[p]Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
[p][Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the]
[p]Nurse's body]
"
"Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;
[p]There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
[p]And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
[p]Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
[p]For it is you that puts us to our shifts:
[p]I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
[p]And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
[p]And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
[p]To be a warrior, and command a camp.
"
"Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.
[p]Sir boy, now let me see your archery;
[p]Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
[p]Terras Astraea reliquit:
[p]Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.
[p]Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall
[p]Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;
[p]Happily you may catch her in the sea;
[p]Yet there's as little justice as at land:
[p]No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;
[p]'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
[p]And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:
[p]Then, when you come to Pluto's region,
[p]I pray you, deliver him this petition;
[p]Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
[p]And that it comes from old Andronicus,
[p]Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
[p]Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable
[p]What time I threw the people's suffrages
[p]On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
[p]Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,
[p]And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:
[p]This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;
[p]And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
"
"O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
[p]To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
"
"Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns
[p]By day and night to attend him carefully,
[p]And feed his humour kindly as we may,
[p]Till time beget some careful remedy.
"
"Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
[p]Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war
[p]Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,
[p]And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.
"
"Publius, how now! how now, my masters!
[p]What, have you met with her?
"
"No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
[p]If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:
[p]Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,
[p]He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,
[p]So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
"
"He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
[p]I'll dive into the burning lake below,
[p]And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
[p]Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we
[p]No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;
[p]But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
[p]Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:
[p]And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,
[p]We will solicit heaven and move the gods
[p]To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.
[p]Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;
[p][He gives them the arrows]
[p]'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'
[p]'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:
[p]Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:
[p]To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;
[p]You were as good to shoot against the wind.
[p]To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.
[p]Of my word, I have written to effect;
[p]There's not a god left unsolicited.
"
"Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
[p]We will afflict the emperor in his pride.
"
"Now, masters, draw.
[p][They shoot]
[p]O, well said, Lucius!
[p]Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.
"
"My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
[p]Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
"
"Ha, ha!
[p]Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?
[p]See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.
"
"This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
[p]The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock
[p]That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;
[p]And who should find them but the empress' villain?
[p]She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose
[p]But give them to his master for a present.
"
"Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!
[p][Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in]
[p]it]
[p]News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.
[p]Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?
[p]Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?
"
"O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken
[p]them down again, for the man must not be hanged till
[p]the next week.
"
"But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
"
"Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him
[p]in all my life.
"
"Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
"
"Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
"
"Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
"
"From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there God
[p]forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my
[p]young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the
[p]tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl
[p]betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.
"
"Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for
[p]your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to
[p]the emperor from you.
"
"Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor
[p]with a grace?
"
"Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
"
"Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,
[p]But give your pigeons to the emperor:
[p]By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
[p]Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.
[p]Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace
[p]deliver a supplication?
"
"Ay, sir.
"
"Then here is a supplication for you. And when you
[p]come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,
[p]then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and
[p]then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see
[p]you do it bravely.
"
"I warrant you, sir, let me alone.
"
"Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it.
[p]Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
[p]For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.
[p]And when thou hast given it the emperor,
[p]Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
"
"God be with you, sir; I will.
"
"Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.
"
"Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen
[p]An emperor in Rome thus overborne,
[p]Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent
[p]Of egal justice, used in such contempt?
[p]My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
[p]However these disturbers of our peace
[p]Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,
[p]But even with law, against the willful sons
[p]Of old Andronicus. And what an if
[p]His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
[p]Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
[p]His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
[p]And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
[p]See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;
[p]This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
[p]Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
[p]What's this but libelling against the senate,
[p]And blazoning our injustice every where?
[p]A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
[p]As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
[p]But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
[p]Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
[p]But he and his shall know that justice lives
[p]In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,
[p]He'll so awake as she in fury shall
[p]Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
"
"My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
[p]Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
[p]Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
[p]The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,
[p]Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;
[p]And rather comfort his distressed plight
[p]Than prosecute the meanest or the best
[p]For these contempts.
[p][Aside]
[p]Why, thus it shall become
[p]High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:
[p]But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
[p]Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,
[p]Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.
[p][Enter Clown]
[p]How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?
"
"Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.
"
"Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.
"
"'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:
[p]I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
"
"Go, take him away, and hang him presently.
"
"How much money must I have?
"
"Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.
"
"Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to
[p]a fair end.
"
"Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
[p]Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
[p]I know from whence this same device proceeds:
[p]May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,
[p]That died by law for murder of our brother,
[p]Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!
[p]Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
[p]Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:
[p]For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;
[p]Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
[p]In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.
[p][Enter AEMILIUS]
[p]What news with thee, AEmilius?
"
"Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.
[p]The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power
[p]high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,
[p]They hither march amain, under conduct
[p]Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;
[p]Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
[p]As much as ever Coriolanus did.
"
"Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
[p]These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
[p]As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
[p]Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:
[p]'Tis he the common people love so much;
[p]Myself hath often over-heard them say,
[p]When I have walked like a private man,
[p]That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
[p]And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
"
"Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
"
"Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,
[p]And will revolt from me to succor him.
"
"King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
[p]Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
[p]The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
[p]And is not careful what they mean thereby,
[p]Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
[p]He can at pleasure stint their melody:
[p]Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
[p]Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,
[p]I will enchant the old Andronicus
[p]With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
[p]Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
[p]When as the one is wounded with the bait,
[p]The other rotted with delicious feed.
"
"But he will not entreat his son for us.
"
"If Tamora entreat him, then he will:
[p]For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
[p]With golden promises; that, were his heart
[p]Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,
[p]Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
[p][To AEmilius]
[p]Go thou before, be our ambassador:
[p]Say that the emperor requests a parley
[p]Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting
[p]Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.
"
"AEmilius, do this message honourably:
[p]And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
[p]Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.
"
"Your bidding shall I do effectually.
"
"Now will I to that old Andronicus;
[p]And temper him with all the art I have,
[p]To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.
[p]And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,
[p]And bury all thy fear in my devices.
"
"Then go successantly, and plead to him.
"
"Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
[p]I have received letters from great Rome,
[p]Which signify what hate they bear their emperor
[p]And how desirous of our sight they are.
[p]Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,
[p]Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,
[p]And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
[p]Let him make treble satisfaction.
"
"Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
[p]Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;
[p]Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
[p]Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
[p]Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,
[p]Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
[p]Led by their master to the flowered fields,
[p]And be avenged on cursed Tamora.
"
"And as he saith, so say we all with him.
"
"I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
[p]But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?
"
"Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
[p]To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
[p]And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye
[p]Upon the wasted building, suddenly
[p]I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
[p]I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
[p]The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
[p]'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
[p]Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
[p]Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
[p]Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:
[p]But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
[p]They never do beget a coal-black calf.
[p]Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates
[p]the babe,--
[p]'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
[p]Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,
[p]Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
[p]With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
[p]Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,
[p]To use as you think needful of the man.
"
"O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
[p]That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
[p]This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,
[p]And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
[p]Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
[p]This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
[p]Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?
[p]A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.
[p]And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
"
"Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
"
"Too like the sire for ever being good.
[p]First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;
[p]A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
[p]Get me a ladder.
"
"Lucius, save the child,
[p]And bear it from me to the empress.
[p]If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
[p]That highly may advantage thee to hear:
[p]If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
[p]I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
"
"Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st
[p]Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
"
"An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
[p]'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
[p]For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,
[p]Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
[p]Complots of mischief, treason, villanies
[p]Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:
[p]And this shall all be buried by my death,
[p]Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
"
"Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
"
"Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
"
"Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
[p]That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
"
"What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
[p]Yet, for I know thou art religious
[p]And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
[p]With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
[p]Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
[p]Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
[p]An idiot holds his bauble for a god
[p]And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
[p]To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
[p]By that same god, what god soe'er it be,
[p]That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
[p]To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
[p]Or else I will discover nought to thee.
"
"Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
"
"First know thou, I begot him on the empress.
"
"O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
"
"Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
[p]To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
[p]'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
[p]They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
[p]And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
"
"O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
"
"Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas
[p]Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
"
"O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!
"
"Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
[p]That codding spirit had they from their mother,
[p]As sure a card as ever won the set;
[p]That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
[p]As true a dog as ever fought at head.
[p]Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
[p]I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
[p]Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
[p]I wrote the letter that thy father found
[p]And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
[p]Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
[p]And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
[p]Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
[p]I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
[p]And, when I had it, drew myself apart
[p]And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
[p]I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
[p]When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
[p]Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
[p]That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
[p]And when I told the empress of this sport,
[p]She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
[p]And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
"
"What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?
"
"Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
"
"Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
"
"Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
[p]Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
[p]Few come within the compass of my curse,--
[p]Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
[p]As kill a man, or else devise his death,
[p]Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
[p]Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,
[p]Set deadly enmity between two friends,
[p]Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
[p]Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
[p]And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
[p]Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
[p]And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
[p]Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
[p]And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
[p]Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
[p]'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
[p]Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
[p]As willingly as one would kill a fly,
[p]And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
[p]But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
"
"Bring down the devil; for he must not die
[p]So sweet a death as hanging presently.
"
"If there be devils, would I were a devil,
[p]To live and burn in everlasting fire,
[p]So I might have your company in hell,
[p]But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
"
"Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
"
"My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
[p]Desires to be admitted to your presence.
"
"Let him come near.
[p][Enter AEMILIUS]
[p]Welcome, AEmilius. what's the news from Rome?
"
"Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
[p]The Roman emperor greets you all by me;
[p]And, for he understands you are in arms,
[p]He craves a parley at your father's house,
[p]Willing you to demand your hostages,
[p]And they shall be immediately deliver'd.
"
"What says our general?
"
"AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges
[p]Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
[p]And we will come. March away.
"
"Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
[p]I will encounter with Andronicus,
[p]And say I am Revenge, sent from below
[p]To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
[p]Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,
[p]To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;
[p]Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,
[p]And work confusion on his enemies.
"
"Who doth molest my contemplation?
[p]Is it your trick to make me ope the door,
[p]That so my sad decrees may fly away,
[p]And all my study be to no effect?
[p]You are deceived: for what I mean to do
[p]See here in bloody lines I have set down;
[p]And what is written shall be executed.
"
"Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
"
"No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,
[p]Wanting a hand to give it action?
[p]Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.
"
"If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.
"
"I am not mad; I know thee well enough:
[p]Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;
[p]Witness these trenches made by grief and care,
[p]Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
[p]Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well
[p]For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:
[p]Is not thy coming for my other hand?
"
"Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;
[p]She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:
[p]I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,
[p]To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,
[p]By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
[p]Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
[p]Confer with me of murder and of death:
[p]There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
[p]No vast obscurity or misty vale,
[p]Where bloody murder or detested rape
[p]Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;
[p]And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
[p]Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
"
"Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,
[p]To be a torment to mine enemies?
"
"I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.
"
"Do me some service, ere I come to thee.
[p]Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
[p]Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,
[p]Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;
[p]And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,
[p]And whirl along with thee about the globe.
[p]Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,
[p]To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
[p]And find out murderers in their guilty caves:
[p]And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
[p]I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel
[p]Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,
[p]Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
[p]Until his very downfall in the sea:
[p]And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
[p]So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
"
"These are my ministers, and come with me.
"
"Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?
"
"Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,
[p]Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
"
"Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!
[p]And you, the empress! but we worldly men
[p]Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
[p]O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;
[p]And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
[p]I will embrace thee in it by and by.
"
"This closing with him fits his lunacy
[p]Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,
[p]Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
[p]For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
[p]And, being credulous in this mad thought,
[p]I'll make him send for Lucius his son;
[p]And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
[p]I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,
[p]To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
[p]Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
[p]See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
"
"Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:
[p]Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:
[p]Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
[p]How like the empress and her sons you are!
[p]Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:
[p]Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
[p]For well I wot the empress never wags
[p]But in her company there is a Moor;
[p]And, would you represent our queen aright,
[p]It were convenient you had such a devil:
[p]But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?
"
"What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
"
"Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
"
"Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
[p]And I am sent to be revenged on him.
"
"Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,
[p]And I will be revenged on them all.
"
"Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
[p]And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.
[p]Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
[p]Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
[p]To find another that is like to thee,
[p]Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.
[p]Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court
[p]There is a queen, attended by a Moor;
[p]Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,
[p]for up and down she doth resemble thee:
[p]I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
[p]They have been violent to me and mine.
"
"Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
[p]But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
[p]To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
[p]Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,
[p]And bid him come and banquet at thy house;
[p]When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
[p]I will bring in the empress and her sons,
[p]The emperor himself and all thy foes;
[p]And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,
[p]And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
[p]What says Andronicus to this device?
"
"Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
[p][Enter MARCUS]
[p]Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
[p]Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
[p]Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
[p]Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;
[p]Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
[p]Tell him the emperor and the empress too
[p]Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
[p]This do thou for my love; and so let him,
[p]As he regards his aged father's life.
"
"This will I do, and soon return again.
"
"Now will I hence about thy business,
[p]And take my ministers along with me.
"
"Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;
[p]Or else I'll call my brother back again,
[p]And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
"
"[Aside to her sons] What say you, boys? will you
[p]bide with him,
[p]Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
[p]How I have govern'd our determined jest?
[p]Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
[p]And tarry with him till I turn again.
"
"[Aside] I know them all, though they suppose me mad,
[p]And will o'erreach them in their own devices:
[p]A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!
"
"Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
"
"Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes
[p]To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
"
"I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
"
"Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
"
"Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
[p]Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!
"
"What is your will?
"
"Know you these two?
"
"The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.
"
"Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;
[p]The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;
[p]And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.
[p]Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.
[p]Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
[p]And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,
[p]And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.
"
"Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
"
"And therefore do we what we are commanded.
[p]Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
[p]Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.
[p][Re-enter TITUS, with LAVINIA; he bearing a knife,]
[p]and she a basin]
"
"Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
[p]Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;
[p]But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
[p]O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
[p]Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
[p]This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
[p]You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault
[p]Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
[p]My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
[p]Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
[p]Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
[p]Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced.
[p]What would you say, if I should let you speak?
[p]Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
[p]Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
[p]This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
[p]Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
[p]The basin that receives your guilty blood.
[p]You know your mother means to feast with me,
[p]And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:
[p]Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
[p]And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,
[p]And of the paste a coffin I will rear
[p]And make two pasties of your shameful heads,
[p]And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,
[p]Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
[p]This is the feast that I have bid her to,
[p]And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
[p]For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,
[p]And worse than Progne I will be revenged:
[p]And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
[p][He cuts their throats]
[p]Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
[p]Let me go grind their bones to powder small
[p]And with this hateful liquor temper it;
[p]And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.
[p]Come, come, be every one officious
[p]To make this banquet; which I wish may prove
[p]More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
[p]So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,
[p]And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.
"
"Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind
[p]That I repair to Rome, I am content.
"
"And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.
"
"Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
[p]This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
[p]Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him
[p]Till he be brought unto the empress' face,
[p]For testimony of her foul proceedings:
[p]And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
[p]I fear the emperor means no good to us.
"
"Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,
[p]And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
[p]The venomous malice of my swelling heart!
"
"Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!
[p]Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
[p][Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within]
[p]The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.
[p][Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS,]
[p]Tribunes, Senators, and others]
"
"What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
"
"What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?
"
"Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;
[p]These quarrels must be quietly debated.
[p]The feast is ready, which the careful Titus
[p]Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,
[p]For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:
[p]Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.
"
"Marcus, we will.
[p][Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table]
[p][Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook, LAVINIA veiled,]
[p]Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes
[p]on the table]
"
"Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;
[p]Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;
[p]And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,
[p]'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
"
"Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?
"
"Because I would be sure to have all well,
[p]To entertain your highness and your empress.
"
"We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
"
"An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
[p]My lord the emperor, resolve me this:
[p]Was it well done of rash Virginius
[p]To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
[p]Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?
"
"It was, Andronicus.
"
"Your reason, mighty lord?
"
"Because the girl should not survive her shame,
[p]And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
"
"A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
[p]A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,
[p]For me, most wretched, to perform the like.
[p]Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;
[p][Kills LAVINIA]
[p]And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!
"
"What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
"
"Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
[p]I am as woful as Virginius was,
[p]And have a thousand times more cause than he
[p]To do this outrage: and it now is done.
"
"What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.
"
"Will't please you eat? will't please your
[p]highness feed?
"
"Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
"
"Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:
[p]They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;
[p]And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
"
"Go fetch them hither to us presently.
"
"Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;
[p]Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
[p]Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
[p]'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.
"
"Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
"
"Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
[p]There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!
[p][Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS,]
[p]and others go up into the balcony]
"
"You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
[p]By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
[p]Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
[p]O, let me teach you how to knit again
[p]This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,
[p]These broken limbs again into one body;
[p]Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
[p]And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,
[p]Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
[p]Do shameful execution on herself.
[p]But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
[p]Grave witnesses of true experience,
[p]Cannot induce you to attend my words,
[p][To LUCIUS]
[p]Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
[p]When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
[p]To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
[p]The story of that baleful burning night
[p]When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,
[p]Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
[p]Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
[p]That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
[p]My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
[p]Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
[p]But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
[p]And break my utterance, even in the time
[p]When it should move you to attend me most,
[p]Lending your kind commiseration.
[p]Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
[p]Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
"
"Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,
[p]That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
[p]Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
[p]And they it were that ravished our sister:
[p]For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;
[p]Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd
[p]Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
[p]And sent her enemies unto the grave.
[p]Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
[p]The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
[p]To beg relief among Rome's enemies:
[p]Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.
[p]And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
[p]I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
[p]That have preserved her welfare in my blood;
[p]And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
[p]Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
[p]Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
[p]My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
[p]That my report is just and full of truth.
[p]But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
[p]Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;
[p]For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
"
"Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
[p][Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant]
[p]Of this was Tamora delivered;
[p]The issue of an irreligious Moor,
[p]Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
[p]The villain is alive in Titus' house,
[p]And as he is, to witness this is true.
[p]Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
[p]These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
[p]Or more than any living man could bear.
[p]Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?
[p]Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,
[p]And, from the place where you behold us now,
[p]The poor remainder of Andronici
[p]Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.
[p]And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,
[p]And make a mutual closure of our house.
[p]Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
[p]Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
"
"Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
[p]And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
[p]Lucius our emperor; for well I know
[p]The common voice do cry it shall be so.
"
"Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!
"
"Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
[p][To Attendants]
[p]And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,
[p]To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,
[p]As punishment for his most wicked life.
"
"Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
"
"Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
[p]To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
[p]But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
[p]For nature puts me to a heavy task:
[p]Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,
[p]To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
[p]O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
[p][Kissing TITUS]
[p]These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
[p]The last true duties of thy noble son!
"
"Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
[p]Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
[p]O were the sum of these that I should pay
[p]Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!
"
"Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
[p]To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
[p]Many a time he danced thee on his knee,
[p]Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:
[p]Many a matter hath he told to thee,
[p]Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;
[p]In that respect, then, like a loving child,
[p]Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
[p]Because kind nature doth require it so:
[p]Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
[p]Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
[p]Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.
"
"O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart
[p]Would I were dead, so you did live again!
[p]O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
[p]My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.
"
"You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
[p]Give sentence on this execrable wretch,
[p]That hath been breeder of these dire events.
"
"Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
[p]There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
[p]If any one relieves or pities him,
[p]For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
[p]Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
"
"O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
[p]I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
[p]I should repent the evils I have done:
[p]Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
[p]Would I perform, if I might have my will;
[p]If one good deed in all my life I did,
[p]I do repent it from my very soul.
"
"Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
[p]And give him burial in his father's grave:
[p]My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
[p]Be closed in our household's monument.
[p]As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
[p]No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,
[p]No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
[p]But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:
[p]Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;
[p]And, being so, shall have like want of pity.
[p]See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
[p]By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
[p]Then, afterwards, to order well the state,
[p]That like events may ne'er it ruinate.
"
"In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
[p]The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,
[p]Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
[p]Fraught with the ministers and instruments
[p]Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore
[p]Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay
[p]Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made
[p]To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures
[p]The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,
[p]With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.
[p]To Tenedos they come;
[p]And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
[p]Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
[p]The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
[p]Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,
[p]Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,
[p]And Antenorides, with massy staples
[p]And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
[p]Sperr up the sons of Troy.
[p]Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,
[p]On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
[p]Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come
[p]A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
[p]Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
[p]In like conditions as our argument,
[p]To tell you, fair beholders, that our play
[p]Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
[p]Beginning in the middle, starting thence away
[p]To what may be digested in a play.
[p]Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
[p]Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.
"
"Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
[p]Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
[p]That find such cruel battle here within?
[p]Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
[p]Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.
"
"Will this gear ne'er be mended?
"
"The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
[p]Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;
[p]But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
[p]Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
[p]Less valiant than the virgin in the night
[p]And skilless as unpractised infancy.
"
"Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
[p]I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
[p]have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
"
"Have I not tarried?
"
"Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry
[p]the bolting.
"
"Have I not tarried?
"
"Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.
"
"Still have I tarried.
"
"Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
[p]'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the
[p]heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must
[p]stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.
"
"Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
[p]Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
[p]At Priam's royal table do I sit;
[p]And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--
[p]So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?
"
"Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw
[p]her look, or any woman else.
"
"I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
[p]As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
[p]Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
[p]I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
[p]Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
[p]But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
[p]Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
"
"An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
[p]well, go to--there were no more comparison between
[p]the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I
[p]would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would
[p]somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I
[p]will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--
"
"O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
[p]When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
[p]Reply not in how many fathoms deep
[p]They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
[p]In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
[p]Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
[p]Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
[p]Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
[p]In whose comparison all whites are ink,
[p]Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
[p]The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
[p]Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,
[p]As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
[p]But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
[p]Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
[p]The knife that made it.
"
"I speak no more than truth.
"
"Thou dost not speak so much.
"
"Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:
[p]if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be
[p]not, she has the mends in her own hands.
"
"Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!
"
"I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of
[p]her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and
[p]between, but small thanks for my labour.
"
"What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?
"
"Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair
[p]as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as
[p]fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
[p]I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.
"
"Say I she is not fair?
"
"I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
[p]stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so
[p]I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,
[p]I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.
"
"Pandarus,--
"
"Not I.
"
"Sweet Pandarus,--
"
"Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I
[p]found it, and there an end.
"
"Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
[p]Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
[p]When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
[p]I cannot fight upon this argument;
[p]It is too starved a subject for my sword.
[p]But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
[p]I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
[p]And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
[p]As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
[p]Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
[p]What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
[p]Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
[p]Between our Ilium and where she resides,
[p]Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,
[p]Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
[p]Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.
"
"How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?
"
"Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
[p]For womanish it is to be from thence.
[p]What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?
"
"That Paris is returned home and hurt.
"
"By whom, AEneas?
"
"Troilus, by Menelaus.
"
"Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
[p]Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
"
"Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!
"
"Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
[p]But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
"
"In all swift haste.
"
"Come, go we then together.
"
"Who were those went by?
"
"Queen Hecuba and Helen.
"
"And whither go they?
"
"Up to the eastern tower,
[p]Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
[p]To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
[p]Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
[p]He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,
[p]And, like as there were husbandry in war,
[p]Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
[p]And to the field goes he; where every flower
[p]Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
[p]In Hector's wrath.
"
"What was his cause of anger?
"
"The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
[p]A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
[p]They call him Ajax.
"
"Good; and what of him?
"
"They say he is a very man per se,
[p]And stands alone.
"
"So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
"
"This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their
[p]particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,
[p]churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
[p]into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
[p]valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
[p]discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
[p]hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
[p]carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
[p]cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
[p]joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
[p]that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
[p]or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
"
"But how should this man, that makes
[p]me smile, make Hector angry?
"
"They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
[p]struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
[p]ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
"
"Who comes here?
"
"Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
"
"Hector's a gallant man.
"
"As may be in the world, lady.
"
"What's that? what's that?
"
"Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
"
"Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?
[p]Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When
[p]were you at Ilium?
"
"This morning, uncle.
"
"What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
[p]armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
[p]up, was she?
"
"Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
"
"Even so: Hector was stirring early.
"
"That were we talking of, and of his anger.
"
"Was he angry?
"
"So he says here.
"
"True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay
[p]about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's
[p]Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
[p]heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
"
"What, is he angry too?
"
"Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
"
"O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
"
"What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a
[p]man if you see him?
"
"Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
"
"Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
"
"Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.
"
"No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
"
"'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
"
"Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.
"
"So he is.
"
"Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.
"
"He is not Hector.
"
"Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
[p]himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend
[p]or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were
[p]in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.
"
"Excuse me.
"
"He is elder.
"
"Pardon me, pardon me.
"
"Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another
[p]tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not
[p]have his wit this year.
"
"He shall not need it, if he have his own.
"
"Nor his qualities.
"
"No matter.
"
"Nor his beauty.
"
"'Twould not become him; his own's better.
"
"You have no judgment, niece: Helen
[p]herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for
[p]a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--
[p]not brown neither,--
"
"No, but brown.
"
"'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
"
"To say the truth, true and not true.
"
"She praised his complexion above Paris.
"
"Why, Paris hath colour enough.
"
"So he has.
"
"Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
[p]him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
[p]having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
[p]flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
[p]lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
[p]a copper nose.
"
"I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
"
"Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
"
"Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other
[p]day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he
[p]has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--
"
"Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
[p]particulars therein to a total.
"
"Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within
[p]three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.
"
"Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
"
"But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
[p]and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
"
"Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
"
"Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling
[p]becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
"
"O, he smiles valiantly.
"
"Does he not?
"
"O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.
"
"Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen
[p]loves Troilus,--
"
"Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll
[p]prove it so.
"
"Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem
[p]an addle egg.
"
"If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
[p]head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.
"
"I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled
[p]his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I
[p]must needs confess,--
"
"Without the rack.
"
"And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
"
"Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
"
"But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
[p]that her eyes ran o'er.
"
"With mill-stones.
"
"And Cassandra laughed.
"
"But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
[p]her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
"
"And Hector laughed.
"
"At what was all this laughing?
"
"Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.
"
"An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
[p]too.
"
"They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
"
"What was his answer?
"
"Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your
[p]chin, and one of them is white.
"
"This is her question.
"
"That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and
[p]fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white
[p]hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'
[p]'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,
[p]my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't
[p]out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!
[p]and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the
[p]rest so laughed, that it passed.
"
"So let it now; for it has been while going by.
"
"Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
"
"So I do.
"
"I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere
[p]a man born in April.
"
"And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
[p]against May.
"
"Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
[p]stand up here, and see them as they pass toward
[p]Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.
"
"At your pleasure.
"
"Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may
[p]see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
[p]names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
"
"Speak not so loud.
"
"That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of
[p]the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark
[p]Troilus; you shall see anon.
"
"Who's that?
"
"That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;
[p]and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest
[p]judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.
[p]When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
[p]he see me, you shall see him nod at me.
"
"Will he give you the nod?
"
"You shall see.
"
"If he do, the rich shall have more.
"
"That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
[p]fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,
[p]niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
[p]a countenance! is't not a brave man?
"
"O, a brave man!
"
"Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you
[p]what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do
[p]you see? look you there: there's no jesting;
[p]there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:
[p]there be hacks!
"
"Be those with swords?
"
"Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come
[p]to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's
[p]heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
[p][PARIS passes]
[p]Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,
[p]is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came
[p]hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do
[p]Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see
[p]Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
"
"Who's that?
"
"That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
[p]Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
"
"Can Helenus fight, uncle?
"
"Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I
[p]marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
[p]people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
"
"What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
"
"Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
[p]there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the
[p]prince of chivalry!
"
"Peace, for shame, peace!
"
"Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon
[p]him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and
[p]his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,
[p]and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
[p]three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!
[p]Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,
[p]he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
[p]Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to
[p]change, would give an eye to boot.
"
"Here come more.
"
"Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
[p]porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
[p]eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles
[p]are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
[p]rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
[p]all Greece.
"
"There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.
"
"Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.
"
"Well, well.
"
"'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have
[p]you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
[p]birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
[p]learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,
[p]and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
"
"Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date
[p]in the pie, for then the man's date's out.
"
"You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
[p]lie.
"
"Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to
[p]defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine
[p]honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
[p]defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
[p]thousand watches.
"
"Say one of your watches.
"
"Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
[p]chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
[p]not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
[p]the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
[p]past watching.
"
"You are such another!
"
"Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
"
"Where?
"
"At your own house; there he unarms him.
"
"Good boy, tell him I come.
[p][Exit boy]
[p]I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
"
"Adieu, uncle.
"
"I'll be with you, niece, by and by.
"
"To bring, uncle?
"
"Ay, a token from Troilus.
"
"By the same token, you are a bawd.
[p][Exit PANDARUS]
[p]Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
[p]He offers in another's enterprise;
[p]But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
[p]Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
[p]Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
[p]Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
[p]That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
[p]Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
[p]That she was never yet that ever knew
[p]Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
[p]Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
[p]Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:
[p]Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
[p]Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
"
"Princes,
[p]What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
[p]The ample proposition that hope makes
[p]In all designs begun on earth below
[p]Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
[p]Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
[p]As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
[p]Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
[p]Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
[p]Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
[p]That we come short of our suppose so far
[p]That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
[p]Sith every action that hath gone before,
[p]Whereof we have record, trial did draw
[p]Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
[p]And that unbodied figure of the thought
[p]That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
[p]Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
[p]And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
[p]But the protractive trials of great Jove
[p]To find persistive constancy in men:
[p]The fineness of which metal is not found
[p]In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
[p]The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
[p]The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
[p]But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
[p]Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
[p]Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
[p]And what hath mass or matter, by itself
[p]Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
"
"With due observance of thy godlike seat,
[p]Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
[p]Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
[p]Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
[p]How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
[p]Upon her patient breast, making their way
[p]With those of nobler bulk!
[p]But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
[p]The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
[p]The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
[p]Bounding between the two moist elements,
[p]Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
[p]Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
[p]Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,
[p]Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
[p]Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
[p]In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
[p]The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
[p]Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
[p]Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
[p]And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
[p]As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
[p]And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
[p]Retorts to chiding fortune.
"
"Agamemnon,
[p]Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
[p]Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.
[p]In whom the tempers and the minds of all
[p]Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
[p]Besides the applause and approbation To which,
[p][To AGAMEMNON]
[p]most mighty for thy place and sway,
[p][To NESTOR]
[p]And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
[p]I give to both your speeches, which were such
[p]As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
[p]Should hold up high in brass, and such again
[p]As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
[p]Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
[p]On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
[p]To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
[p]Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.
"
"Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
[p]That matter needless, of importless burden,
[p]Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
[p]When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
[p]We shall hear music, wit and oracle.
"
"Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
[p]And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
[p]But for these instances.
[p]The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
[p]And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
[p]Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
[p]When that the general is not like the hive
[p]To whom the foragers shall all repair,
[p]What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
[p]The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
[p]The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
[p]Observe degree, priority and place,
[p]Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
[p]Office and custom, in all line of order;
[p]And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
[p]In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
[p]Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
[p]Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
[p]And posts, like the commandment of a king,
[p]Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
[p]In evil mixture to disorder wander,
[p]What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
[p]What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
[p]Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
[p]Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
[p]The unity and married calm of states
[p]Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,
[p]Which is the ladder to all high designs,
[p]Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,
[p]Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
[p]Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
[p]The primogenitive and due of birth,
[p]Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
[p]But by degree, stand in authentic place?
[p]Take but degree away, untune that string,
[p]And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
[p]In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
[p]Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
[p]And make a sop of all this solid globe:
[p]Strength should be lord of imbecility,
[p]And the rude son should strike his father dead:
[p]Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
[p]Between whose endless jar justice resides,
[p]Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
[p]Then every thing includes itself in power,
[p]Power into will, will into appetite;
[p]And appetite, an universal wolf,
[p]So doubly seconded with will and power,
[p]Must make perforce an universal prey,
[p]And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
[p]This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
[p]Follows the choking.
[p]And this neglection of degree it is
[p]That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
[p]It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
[p]By him one step below, he by the next,
[p]That next by him beneath; so every step,
[p]Exampled by the first pace that is sick
[p]Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
[p]Of pale and bloodless emulation:
[p]And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
[p]Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
[p]Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
"
"Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
[p]The fever whereof all our power is sick.
"
"The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
[p]What is the remedy?
"
"The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
[p]The sinew and the forehand of our host,
[p]Having his ear full of his airy fame,
[p]Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
[p]Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
[p]Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
[p]Breaks scurril jests;
[p]And with ridiculous and awkward action,
[p]Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
[p]He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
[p]Thy topless deputation he puts on,
[p]And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
[p]Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
[p]To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
[p]'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--
[p]Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
[p]He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
[p]'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
[p]Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd
[p]Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
[p]The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
[p]From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
[p]Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
[p]Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
[p]As he being drest to some oration.'
[p]That's done, as near as the extremest ends
[p]Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
[p]Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
[p]'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
[p]Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
[p]And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
[p]Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
[p]And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
[p]Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
[p]Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
[p]Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
[p]In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,
[p]All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
[p]Severals and generals of grace exact,
[p]Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
[p]Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
[p]Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
[p]As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
"
"And in the imitation of these twain--
[p]Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
[p]With an imperial voice--many are infect.
[p]Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
[p]In such a rein, in full as proud a place
[p]As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
[p]Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
[p]Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
[p]A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
[p]To match us in comparisons with dirt,
[p]To weaken and discredit our exposure,
[p]How rank soever rounded in with danger.
"
"They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
[p]Count wisdom as no member of the war,
[p]Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
[p]But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
[p]That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
[p]When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
[p]Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--
[p]Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
[p]They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;
[p]So that the ram that batters down the wall,
[p]For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
[p]They place before his hand that made the engine,
[p]Or those that with the fineness of their souls
[p]By reason guide his execution.
"
"Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
[p]Makes many Thetis' sons.
"
"What trumpet? look, Menelaus.
"
"From Troy.
"
"What would you 'fore our tent?
"
"Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
"
"Even this.
"
"May one, that is a herald and a prince,
[p]Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
"
"With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
[p]'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
[p]Call Agamemnon head and general.
"
"Fair leave and large security. How may
[p]A stranger to those most imperial looks
[p]Know them from eyes of other mortals?
"
"How!
"
"Ay;
[p]I ask, that I might waken reverence,
[p]And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
[p]Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
[p]The youthful Phoebus:
[p]Which is that god in office, guiding men?
[p]Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
"
"This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
[p]Are ceremonious courtiers.
"
"Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
[p]As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
[p]But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
[p]Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,
[p]Jove's accord,
[p]Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
[p]Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
[p]The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
[p]If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
[p]But what the repining enemy commends,
[p]That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,
[p]transcends.
"
"Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?
"
"Ay, Greek, that is my name.
"
"What's your affair I pray you?
"
"Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
"
"He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
"
"Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
[p]I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
[p]To set his sense on the attentive bent,
[p]And then to speak.
"
"Speak frankly as the wind;
[p]It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
[p]That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
[p]He tells thee so himself.
"
"Trumpet, blow loud,
[p]Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
[p]And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
[p]What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
[p][Trumpet sounds]
[p]We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
[p]A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
[p]Who in this dull and long-continued truce
[p]Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
[p]And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
[p]If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
[p]That holds his honour higher than his ease,
[p]That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
[p]That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
[p]That loves his mistress more than in confession,
[p]With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
[p]And dare avow her beauty and her worth
[p]In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
[p]Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
[p]Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
[p]He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
[p]Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
[p]And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
[p]Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
[p]To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
[p]If any come, Hector shall honour him;
[p]If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
[p]The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
[p]The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
"
"This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;
[p]If none of them have soul in such a kind,
[p]We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
[p]And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
[p]That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
[p]If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
[p]That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.
"
"Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
[p]When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
[p]But if there be not in our Grecian host
[p]One noble man that hath one spark of fire,
[p]To answer for his love, tell him from me
[p]I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
[p]And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
[p]And meeting him will tell him that my lady
[p]Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
[p]As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
[p]I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
"
"Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
"
"Amen.
"
"Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
[p]To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
[p]Achilles shall have word of this intent;
[p]So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
[p]Yourself shall feast with us before you go
[p]And find the welcome of a noble foe.
"
"Nestor!
"
"What says Ulysses?
"
"I have a young conception in my brain;
[p]Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
"
"What is't?
"
"This 'tis:
[p]Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
[p]That hath to this maturity blown up
[p]In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,
[p]Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
[p]To overbulk us all.
"
"Well, and how?
"
"This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
[p]However it is spread in general name,
[p]Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
"
"The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,
[p]Whose grossness little characters sum up:
[p]And, in the publication, make no strain,
[p]But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
[p]As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,
[p]'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,
[p]Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose
[p]Pointing on him.
"
"And wake him to the answer, think you?
"
"Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
[p]That can from Hector bring his honour off,
[p]If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,
[p]Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
[p]For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
[p]With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
[p]Our imputation shall be oddly poised
[p]In this wild action; for the success,
[p]Although particular, shall give a scantling
[p]Of good or bad unto the general;
[p]And in such indexes, although small pricks
[p]To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
[p]The baby figure of the giant mass
[p]Of things to come at large. It is supposed
[p]He that meets Hector issues from our choice
[p]And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
[p]Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
[p]As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd
[p]Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
[p]What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
[p]To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
[p]Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
[p]In no less working than are swords and bows
[p]Directive by the limbs.
"
"Give pardon to my speech:
[p]Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
[p]Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,
[p]And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,
[p]The lustre of the better yet to show,
[p]Shall show the better. Do not consent
[p]That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
[p]For both our honour and our shame in this
[p]Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
"
"I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
"
"What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
[p]Were he not proud, we all should share with him:
[p]But he already is too insolent;
[p]And we were better parch in Afric sun
[p]Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
[p]Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,
[p]Why then, we did our main opinion crush
[p]In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;
[p]And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
[p]The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
[p]Give him allowance for the better man;
[p]For that will physic the great Myrmidon
[p]Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
[p]His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
[p]If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
[p]We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
[p]Yet go we under our opinion still
[p]That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
[p]Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
[p]Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
"
"Ulysses,
[p]Now I begin to relish thy advice;
[p]And I will give a taste of it forthwith
[p]To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.
[p]Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
[p]Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.
"
"Thersites!
"
"Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,
[p]generally?
"
"Thersites!
"
"And those boils did run? say so: did not the
[p]general run then? were not that a botchy core?
"
"Dog!
"
"Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.
"
"Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
[p][Beating him]
[p]Feel, then.
"
"The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel
[p]beef-witted lord!
"
"Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will
[p]beat thee into handsomeness.
"
"I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,
[p]I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than
[p]thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
[p]canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!
"
"Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
"
"Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?
"
"The proclamation!
"
"Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.
"
"Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.
"
"I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had
[p]the scratching of thee; I would make thee the
[p]loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in
[p]the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.
"
"I say, the proclamation!
"
"Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,
[p]and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as
[p]Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou
[p]barkest at him.
"
"Mistress Thersites!
"
"Thou shouldest strike him.
"
"Cobloaf!
"
"He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a
[p]sailor breaks a biscuit.
"
"[Beating him] You whoreson cur!
"
"Do, do.
"
"Thou stool for a witch!
"
"Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no
[p]more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego
[p]may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art
[p]here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and
[p]sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.
[p]If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and
[p]tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no
[p]bowels, thou!
"
"You dog!
"
"You scurvy lord!
"
"[Beating him] You cur!
"
"Mars his idiot! do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.
"
"Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,
[p]Thersites! what's the matter, man?
"
"You see him there, do you?
"
"Ay; what's the matter?
"
"Nay, look upon him.
"
"So I do: what's the matter?
"
"Nay, but regard him well.
"
"'Well!' why, I do so.
"
"But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you
[p]take him to be, he is Ajax.
"
"I know that, fool.
"
"Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
"
"Therefore I beat thee.
"
"Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his
[p]evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his
[p]brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy
[p]nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not
[p]worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,
[p]Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and
[p]his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of
[p]him.
"
"What?
"
"I say, this Ajax--
"
"Nay, good Ajax.
"
"Has not so much wit--
"
"Nay, I must hold you.
"
"As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he
[p]comes to fight.
"
"Peace, fool!
"
"I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will
[p]not: he there: that he: look you there.
"
"O thou damned cur! I shall--
"
"Will you set your wit to a fool's?
"
"No, I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.
"
"Good words, Thersites.
"
"What's the quarrel?
"
"I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
[p]proclamation, and he rails upon me.
"
"I serve thee not.
"
"Well, go to, go to.
"
"I serve here voluntarily.
"
"Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not
[p]voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was
[p]here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.
"
"E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your
[p]sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great
[p]catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'
[p]were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
"
"What, with me too, Thersites?
"
"There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy
[p]ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you
[p]like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.
"
"What, what?
"
"Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!
"
"I shall cut out your tongue.
"
"'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou
[p]afterwards.
"
"No more words, Thersites; peace!
"
"I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?
"
"There's for you, Patroclus.
"
"I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come
[p]any more to your tents: I will keep where there is
[p]wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.
"
"A good riddance.
"
"Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:
[p]That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
[p]Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
[p]To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
[p]That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
[p]Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
"
"Farewell. Who shall answer him?
"
"I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise
[p]He knew his man.
"
"O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.
"
"After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
[p]Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
[p]'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--
[p]As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
[p]Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
[p]In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
[p]Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?
"
"Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
[p]As far as toucheth my particular,
[p]Yet, dread Priam,
[p]There is no lady of more softer bowels,
[p]More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
[p]More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
[p]Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
[p]Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
[p]The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
[p]To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
[p]Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
[p]Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
[p]Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
[p]If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
[p]To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
[p]Had it our name, the value of one ten,
[p]What merit's in that reason which denies
[p]The yielding of her up?
"
"Fie, fie, my brother!
[p]Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
[p]So great as our dread father in a scale
[p]Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
[p]The past proportion of his infinite?
[p]And buckle in a waist most fathomless
[p]With spans and inches so diminutive
[p]As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
"
"No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,
[p]You are so empty of them. Should not our father
[p]Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,
[p]Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
"
"You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
[p]You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
[p]your reasons:
[p]You know an enemy intends you harm;
[p]You know a sword employ'd is perilous,
[p]And reason flies the object of all harm:
[p]Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
[p]A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
[p]The very wings of reason to his heels
[p]And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
[p]Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
[p]Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
[p]Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat
[p]their thoughts
[p]With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
[p]Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
"
"Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
[p]The holding.
"
"What is aught, but as 'tis valued?
"
"But value dwells not in particular will;
[p]It holds his estimate and dignity
[p]As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
[p]As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
[p]To make the service greater than the god
[p]And the will dotes that is attributive
[p]To what infectiously itself affects,
[p]Without some image of the affected merit.
"
"I take to-day a wife, and my election
[p]Is led on in the conduct of my will;
[p]My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
[p]Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
[p]Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
[p]Although my will distaste what it elected,
[p]The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
[p]To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
[p]We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,
[p]When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands
[p]We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
[p]Because we now are full. It was thought meet
[p]Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
[p]Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
[p]The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
[p]And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,
[p]And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
[p]He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
[p]Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
[p]Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
[p]Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
[p]Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
[p]And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
[p]If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
[p]As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--
[p]If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
[p]As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands
[p]And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
[p]The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
[p]And do a deed that fortune never did,
[p]Beggar the estimation which you prized
[p]Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
[p]That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
[p]But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,
[p]That in their country did them that disgrace,
[p]We fear to warrant in our native place!
"
"[Within] Cry, Trojans, cry!
"
"What noise? what shriek is this?
"
"'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.
"
"[Within] Cry, Trojans!
"
"It is Cassandra.
"
"Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,
[p]And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
"
"Peace, sister, peace!
"
"Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
[p]Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
[p]Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
[p]A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
[p]Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
[p]Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
[p]Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
[p]Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:
[p]Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.
"
"Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
[p]Of divination in our sister work
[p]Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
[p]So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
[p]Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
[p]Can qualify the same?
"
"Why, brother Hector,
[p]We may not think the justness of each act
[p]Such and no other than event doth form it,
[p]Nor once deject the courage of our minds,
[p]Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
[p]Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
[p]Which hath our several honours all engaged
[p]To make it gracious. For my private part,
[p]I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
[p]And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
[p]Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
[p]To fight for and maintain!
"
"Else might the world convince of levity
[p]As well my undertakings as your counsels:
[p]But I attest the gods, your full consent
[p]Gave wings to my propension and cut off
[p]All fears attending on so dire a project.
[p]For what, alas, can these my single arms?
[p]What Propugnation is in one man's valour,
[p]To stand the push and enmity of those
[p]This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
[p]Were I alone to pass the difficulties
[p]And had as ample power as I have will,
[p]Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
[p]Nor faint in the pursuit.
"
"Paris, you speak
[p]Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
[p]You have the honey still, but these the gall;
[p]So to be valiant is no praise at all.
"
"Sir, I propose not merely to myself
[p]The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
[p]But I would have the soil of her fair rape
[p]Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
[p]What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
[p]Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,
[p]Now to deliver her possession up
[p]On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
[p]That so degenerate a strain as this
[p]Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
[p]There's not the meanest spirit on our party
[p]Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
[p]When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
[p]Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
[p]Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,
[p]Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
[p]The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
"
"Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
[p]And on the cause and question now in hand
[p]Have glozed, but superficially: not much
[p]Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
[p]Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
[p]The reasons you allege do more conduce
[p]To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
[p]Than to make up a free determination
[p]'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
[p]Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
[p]Of any true decision. Nature craves
[p]All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
[p]What nearer debt in all humanity
[p]Than wife is to the husband? If this law
[p]Of nature be corrupted through affection,
[p]And that great minds, of partial indulgence
[p]To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
[p]There is a law in each well-order'd nation
[p]To curb those raging appetites that are
[p]Most disobedient and refractory.
[p]If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
[p]As it is known she is, these moral laws
[p]Of nature and of nations speak aloud
[p]To have her back return'd: thus to persist
[p]In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
[p]But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
[p]Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,
[p]My spritely brethren, I propend to you
[p]In resolution to keep Helen still,
[p]For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
[p]Upon our joint and several dignities.
"
"Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:
[p]Were it not glory that we more affected
[p]Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
[p]I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
[p]Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
[p]She is a theme of honour and renown,
[p]A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
[p]Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
[p]And fame in time to come canonize us;
[p]For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
[p]So rich advantage of a promised glory
[p]As smiles upon the forehead of this action
[p]For the wide world's revenue.
"
"I am yours,
[p]You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
[p]I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
[p]The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
[p]Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
[p]I was advertised their great general slept,
[p]Whilst emulation in the army crept:
[p]This, I presume, will wake him.
"
"How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of
[p]thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
[p]beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!
[p]would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,
[p]whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to
[p]conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of
[p]my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a
[p]rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
[p]undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of
[p]themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
[p]forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,
[p]Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy
[p]caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less
[p]than little wit from them that they have! which
[p]short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
[p]scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
[p]from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and
[p]cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the
[p]whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,
[p]methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war
[p]for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
[p]say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!
"
"Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.
"
"If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou
[p]wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
[p]it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common
[p]curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in
[p]great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and
[p]discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
[p]direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
[p]out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and
[p]sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.
[p]Amen. Where's Achilles?
"
"What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?
"
"Ay: the heavens hear me!
"
"Who's there?
"
"Thersites, my lord.
"
"Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my
[p]digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to
[p]my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?
"
"Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,
[p]what's Achilles?
"
"Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,
[p]what's thyself?
"
"Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,
[p]what art thou?
"
"Thou mayst tell that knowest.
"
"O, tell, tell.
"
"I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
[p]Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'
[p]knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
"
"You rascal!
"
"Peace, fool! I have not done.
"
"He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.
"
"Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites
[p]is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
"
"Derive this; come.
"
"Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;
[p]Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;
[p]Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and
[p]Patroclus is a fool positive.
"
"Why am I a fool?
"
"Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou
[p]art. Look you, who comes here?
"
"Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.
[p]Come in with me, Thersites.
"
"Here is such patchery, such juggling and such
[p]knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a
[p]whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
[p]and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on
[p]the subject! and war and lechery confound all!
"
"Where is Achilles?
"
"Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.
"
"Let it be known to him that we are here.
[p]He shent our messengers; and we lay by
[p]Our appertainments, visiting of him:
[p]Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
[p]We dare not move the question of our place,
[p]Or know not what we are.
"
"I shall say so to him.
"
"We saw him at the opening of his tent:
[p]He is not sick.
"
"Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it
[p]melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my
[p]head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the
[p]cause. A word, my lord.
"
"What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
"
"Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
"
"Who, Thersites?
"
"He.
"
"Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.
"
"No, you see, he is his argument that has his
[p]argument, Achilles.
"
"All the better; their fraction is more our wish than
[p]their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
[p]could disunite.
"
"The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily
[p]untie. Here comes Patroclus.
"
"No Achilles with him.
"
"The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:
[p]his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
"
"Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,
[p]If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
[p]Did move your greatness and this noble state
[p]To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
[p]But for your health and your digestion sake,
[p]And after-dinner's breath.
"
"Hear you, Patroclus:
[p]We are too well acquainted with these answers:
[p]But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
[p]Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
[p]Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
[p]Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
[p]Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
[p]Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
[p]Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
[p]Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
[p]We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,
[p]If you do say we think him over-proud
[p]And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
[p]Than in the note of judgment; and worthier
[p]than himself
[p]Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
[p]Disguise the holy strength of their command,
[p]And underwrite in an observing kind
[p]His humorous predominance; yea, watch
[p]His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
[p]The passage and whole carriage of this action
[p]Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
[p]That if he overhold his price so much,
[p]We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine
[p]Not portable, lie under this report:
[p]'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:
[p]A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
[p]Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
"
"I shall; and bring his answer presently.
"
"In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
[p]We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
"
"What is he more than another?
"
"No more than what he thinks he is.
"
"Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
[p]better man than I am?
"
"No question.
"
"Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
"
"No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as
[p]wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether
[p]more tractable.
"
"Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
[p]know not what pride is.
"
"Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
[p]fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
[p]his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;
[p]and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours
[p]the deed in the praise.
"
"I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.
"
"Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
"
"Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
"
"What's his excuse?
"
"He doth rely on none,
[p]But carries on the stream of his dispose
[p]Without observance or respect of any,
[p]In will peculiar and in self-admission.
"
"Why will he not upon our fair request
[p]Untent his person and share the air with us?
"
"Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,
[p]He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,
[p]And speaks not to himself but with a pride
[p]That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
[p]Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
[p]That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
[p]Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
[p]And batters down himself: what should I say?
[p]He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
[p]Cry 'No recovery.'AGAMEMNON. Let Ajax go to him.
[p]Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
[p]'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
[p]At your request a little from himself.
"
"O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
[p]We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
[p]When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
[p]That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
[p]And never suffers matter of the world
[p]Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
[p]And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd
[p]Of that we hold an idol more than he?
[p]No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
[p]Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;
[p]Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
[p]As amply titled as Achilles is,
[p]By going to Achilles:
[p]That were to enlard his fat already pride
[p]And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
[p]With entertaining great Hyperion.
[p]This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
[p]And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
"
"[Aside to DIOMEDES] O, this is well; he rubs the
[p]vein of him.
"
"[Aside to NESTOR] And how his silence drinks up
[p]this applause!
"
"If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.
"
"O, no, you shall not go.
"
"An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:
[p]Let me go to him.
"
"Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
"
"A paltry, insolent fellow!
"
"How he describes himself!
"
"Can he not be sociable?
"
"The raven chides blackness.
"
"I'll let his humours blood.
"
"He will be the physician that should be the patient.
"
"An all men were o' my mind,--
"
"Wit would be out of fashion.
"
"A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:
[p]shall pride carry it?
"
"An 'twould, you'ld carry half.
"
"A' would have ten shares.
"
"I will knead him; I'll make him supple.
"
"He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:
[p]pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.
"
"[To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
"
"Our noble general, do not do so.
"
"You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
"
"Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
[p]Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
[p]I will be silent.
"
"Wherefore should you so?
[p]He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
"
"Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
"
"A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!
[p]Would he were a Trojan!
"
"What a vice were it in Ajax now,--
"
"If he were proud,--
"
"Or covetous of praise,--
"
"Ay, or surly borne,--
"
"Or strange, or self-affected!
"
"Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;
[p]Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:
[p]Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
[p]Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:
[p]But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,
[p]Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
[p]And give him half: and, for thy vigour,
[p]Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
[p]To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
[p]Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines
[p]Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;
[p]Instructed by the antiquary times,
[p]He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:
[p]Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
[p]As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,
[p]You should not have the eminence of him,
[p]But be as Ajax.
"
"Shall I call you father?
"
"Ay, my good son.
"
"Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.
"
"There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
[p]Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
[p]To call together all his state of war;
[p]Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow
[p]We must with all our main of power stand fast:
[p]And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,
[p]And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
"
"Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
[p]Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
"
"Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow
[p]the young Lord Paris?
"
"Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
"
"You depend upon him, I mean?
"
"Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
"
"You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs
[p]praise him.
"
"The lord be praised!
"
"You know me, do you not?
"
"Faith, sir, superficially.
"
"Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.
"
"I hope I shall know your honour better.
"
"I do desire it.
"
"You are in the state of grace.
"
"Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.
[p][Music within]
[p]What music is this?
"
"I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.
"
"Know you the musicians?
"
"Wholly, sir.
"
"Who play they to?
"
"To the hearers, sir.
"
"At whose pleasure, friend
"
"At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
"
"Command, I mean, friend.
"
"Who shall I command, sir?
"
"Friend, we understand not one another: I am too
[p]courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request
[p]do these men play?
"
"That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request
[p]of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,
[p]the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's
[p]invisible soul,--
"
"Who, my cousin Cressida?
"
"No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her
[p]attributes?
"
"It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the
[p]Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the
[p]Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault
[p]upon him, for my business seethes.
"
"Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
"
"Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair
[p]company! fair desires, in all fair measure,
[p]fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!
[p]fair thoughts be your fair pillow!
"
"Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
"
"You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair
[p]prince, here is good broken music.
"
"You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you
[p]shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out
[p]with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full
[p]of harmony.
"
"Truly, lady, no.
"
"O, sir,--
"
"Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
"
"Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.
"
"I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,
[p]will you vouchsafe me a word?
"
"Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you
[p]sing, certainly.
"
"Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,
[p]marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed
[p]friend, your brother Troilus,--
"
"My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--
"
"Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most
[p]affectionately to you,--
"
"You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,
[p]our melancholy upon your head!
"
"Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.
"
"And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
"
"Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,
[p]in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,
[p]no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king
[p]call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.
"
"My Lord Pandarus,--
"
"What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
"
"What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?
"
"Nay, but, my lord,--
"
"What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out
[p]with you. You must not know where he sups.
"
"I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
"
"No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your
[p]disposer is sick.
"
"Well, I'll make excuse.
"
"Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,
[p]your poor disposer's sick.
"
"I spy.
"
"You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
[p]instrument. Now, sweet queen.
"
"Why, this is kindly done.
"
"My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,
[p]sweet queen.
"
"She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.
"
"He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.
"
"Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
"
"Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
[p]you a song now.
"
"Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou
[p]hast a fine forehead.
"
"Ay, you may, you may.
"
"Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.
[p]O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!
"
"Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.
"
"Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
"
"In good troth, it begins so.
[p][Sings]
[p]Love, love, nothing but love, still more!
[p]For, O, love's bow
[p]Shoots buck and doe:
[p]The shaft confounds,
[p]Not that it wounds,
[p]But tickles still the sore.
[p]These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!
[p]Yet that which seems the wound to kill,
[p]Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!
[p]So dying love lives still:
[p]Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
[p]Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!
[p]Heigh-ho!
"
"In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
"
"He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot
[p]blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot
[p]thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.
"
"Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot
[p]thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:
[p]is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's
[p]a-field to-day?
"
"Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the
[p]gallantry of Troy: I would fain have armed to-day,
[p]but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my
[p]brother Troilus went not?
"
"He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.
"
"Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they
[p]sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
"
"To a hair.
"
"Farewell, sweet queen.
"
"Commend me to your niece.
"
"I will, sweet queen.
"
"They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,
[p]To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
[p]To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
[p]With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
[p]Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
[p]Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
[p]Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.
"
"'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;
[p]Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
[p]Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
[p]Yea, overshines ourself.
"
"Sweet, above thought I love thee.
"
"How now! where's thy master? at my cousin
[p]Cressida's?
"
"No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.
"
"O, here he comes.
[p][Enter TROILUS]
[p]How now, how now!
"
"Sirrah, walk off.
"
"Have you seen my cousin?
"
"No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,
[p]Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
[p]Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,
[p]And give me swift transportance to those fields
[p]Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
[p]Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,
[p]From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
[p]And fly with me to Cressid!
"
"Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.
"
"I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
[p]The imaginary relish is so sweet
[p]That it enchants my sense: what will it be,
[p]When that the watery palate tastes indeed
[p]Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,
[p]Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
[p]Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,
[p]For the capacity of my ruder powers:
[p]I fear it much; and I do fear besides,
[p]That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
[p]As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
[p]The enemy flying.
"
"She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you
[p]must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches
[p]her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a
[p]sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest
[p]villain: she fetches her breath as short as a
[p]new-ta'en sparrow.
"
"Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:
[p]My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;
[p]And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
[p]Like vassalage at unawares encountering
[p]The eye of majesty.
"
"Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.
[p]Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that
[p]you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?
[p]you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?
[p]Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,
[p]we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to
[p]her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your
[p]picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend
[p]daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.
[p]So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!
[p]a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air
[p]is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
[p]I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the
[p]ducks i' the river: go to, go to.
"
"You have bereft me of all words, lady.
"
"Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll
[p]bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your
[p]activity in question. What, billing again? Here's
[p]'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--
[p]Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.
"
"Will you walk in, my lord?
"
"O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!
"
"Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!
"
"What should they grant? what makes this pretty
[p]abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet
[p]lady in the fountain of our love?
"
"More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
"
"Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.
"
"Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer
[p]footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
[p]fear the worst oft cures the worse.
"
"O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's
[p]pageant there is presented no monster.
"
"Nor nothing monstrous neither?
"
"Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep
[p]seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking
[p]it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
[p]enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
[p]This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will
[p]is infinite and the execution confined, that the
[p]desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.
"
"They say all lovers swear more performance than they
[p]are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
[p]perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and
[p]discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
[p]that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,
[p]are they not monsters?
"
"Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
[p]are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go
[p]bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
[p]shall have a praise in present: we will not name
[p]desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition
[p]shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
[p]shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
[p]shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can
[p]speak truest not truer than Troilus.
"
"Will you walk in, my lord?
"
"What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?
"
"Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.
"
"I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,
[p]you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
[p]flinch, chide me for it.
"
"You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my
[p]firm faith.
"
"Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,
[p]though they be long ere they are wooed, they are
[p]constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;
[p]they'll stick where they are thrown.
"
"Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.
[p]Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
[p]For many weary months.
"
"Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
"
"Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,
[p]With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
[p]If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
[p]I love you now; but not, till now, so much
[p]But I might master it: in faith, I lie;
[p]My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
[p]Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
[p]Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
[p]When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
[p]But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;
[p]And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
[p]Or that we women had men's privilege
[p]Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
[p]For in this rapture I shall surely speak
[p]The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
[p]Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
[p]My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.
"
"And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.
"
"Pretty, i' faith.
"
"My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
[p]'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:
[p]I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
[p]For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
"
"Your leave, sweet Cressid!
"
"Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--
"
"Pray you, content you.
"
"What offends you, lady?
"
"Sir, mine own company.
"
"You cannot shun Yourself.
"
"Let me go and try:
[p]I have a kind of self resides with you;
[p]But an unkind self, that itself will leave,
[p]To be another's fool. I would be gone:
[p]Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
"
"Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
"
"Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
[p]And fell so roundly to a large confession,
[p]To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,
[p]Or else you love not, for to be wise and love
[p]Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
"
"O that I thought it could be in a woman--
[p]As, if it can, I will presume in you--
[p]To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;
[p]To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
[p]Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
[p]That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
[p]Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,
[p]That my integrity and truth to you
[p]Might be affronted with the match and weight
[p]Of such a winnow'd purity in love;
[p]How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
[p]I am as true as truth's simplicity
[p]And simpler than the infancy of truth.
"
"In that I'll war with you.
"
"O virtuous fight,
[p]When right with right wars who shall be most right!
[p]True swains in love shall in the world to come
[p]Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,
[p]Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
[p]Want similes, truth tired with iteration,
[p]As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
[p]As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
[p]As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,
[p]Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
[p]As truth's authentic author to be cited,
[p]'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,
[p]And sanctify the numbers.
"
"Prophet may you be!
[p]If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
[p]When time is old and hath forgot itself,
[p]When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
[p]And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
[p]And mighty states characterless are grated
[p]To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
[p]From false to false, among false maids in love,
[p]Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
[p]As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
[p]As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,
[p]Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'
[p]'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
[p]'As false as Cressid.'
"
"Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the
[p]witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.
[p]If ever you prove false one to another, since I have
[p]taken such pains to bring you together, let all
[p]pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end
[p]after my name; call them all Pandars; let all
[p]constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,
[p]and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.
"
"Amen.
"
"Amen.
"
"Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
[p]bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your
[p]pretty encounters, press it to death: away!
[p]And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
[p]Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!
"
"Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
[p]The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
[p]To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
[p]That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
[p]I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
[p]Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
[p]From certain and possess'd conveniences,
[p]To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
[p]That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
[p]Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
[p]And here, to do you service, am become
[p]As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
[p]I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
[p]To give me now a little benefit,
[p]Out of those many register'd in promise,
[p]Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
"
"What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.
"
"You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
[p]Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
[p]Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
[p]Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
[p]Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
[p]I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
[p]That their negotiations all must slack,
[p]Wanting his manage; and they will almost
[p]Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
[p]In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
[p]And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
[p]Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
[p]In most accepted pain.
"
"Let Diomedes bear him,
[p]And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
[p]What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
[p]Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
[p]Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
[p]Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
"
"This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
[p]Which I am proud to bear.
"
"Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
[p]Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
[p]As if he were forgot; and, princes all,
[p]Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
[p]I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
[p]Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
[p]If so, I have derision medicinable,
[p]To use between your strangeness and his pride,
[p]Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
[p]It may be good: pride hath no other glass
[p]To show itself but pride, for supple knees
[p]Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
"
"We'll execute your purpose, and put on
[p]A form of strangeness as we pass along:
[p]So do each lord, and either greet him not,
[p]Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
[p]Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
"
"What, comes the general to speak with me?
[p]You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
"
"What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
"
"Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
"
"No.
"
"Nothing, my lord.
"
"The better.
"
"Good day, good day.
"
"How do you? how do you?
"
"What, does the cuckold scorn me?
"
"How now, Patroclus!
"
"Good morrow, Ajax.
"
"Ha?
"
"Good morrow.
"
"Ay, and good next day too.
"
"What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
"
"They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
[p]To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
[p]To come as humbly as they used to creep
[p]To holy altars.
"
"What, am I poor of late?
[p]'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
[p]Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
[p]He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
[p]As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
[p]Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
[p]And not a man, for being simply man,
[p]Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
[p]That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
[p]Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
[p]Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
[p]The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
[p]Do one pluck down another and together
[p]Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
[p]Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
[p]At ample point all that I did possess,
[p]Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
[p]Something not worth in me such rich beholding
[p]As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
[p]I'll interrupt his reading.
[p]How now Ulysses!
"
"Now, great Thetis' son!
"
"What are you reading?
"
"A strange fellow here
[p]Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
[p]How much in having, or without or in,
[p]Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
[p]Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
[p]As when his virtues shining upon others
[p]Heat them and they retort that heat again
[p]To the first giver.'
"
"This is not strange, Ulysses.
[p]The beauty that is borne here in the face
[p]The bearer knows not, but commends itself
[p]To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
[p]That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
[p]Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
[p]Salutes each other with each other's form;
[p]For speculation turns not to itself,
[p]Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
[p]Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
"
"I do not strain at the position,--
[p]It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;
[p]Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
[p]That no man is the lord of any thing,
[p]Though in and of him there be much consisting,
[p]Till he communicate his parts to others:
[p]Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
[p]Till he behold them form'd in the applause
[p]Where they're extended; who, like an arch,
[p]reverberates
[p]The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
[p]Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
[p]His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;
[p]And apprehended here immediately
[p]The unknown Ajax.
[p]Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
[p]That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
[p]Most abject in regard and dear in use!
[p]What things again most dear in the esteem
[p]And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
[p]An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
[p]Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
[p]While some men leave to do!
[p]How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
[p]Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
[p]How one man eats into another's pride,
[p]While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
[p]To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
[p]They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
[p]As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
[p]And great Troy shrieking.
"
"I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
[p]As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
[p]Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
"
"Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
[p]Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
[p]A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
[p]Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
[p]As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
[p]As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
[p]Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
[p]Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
[p]In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
[p]For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
[p]Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
[p]For emulation hath a thousand sons
[p]That one by one pursue: if you give way,
[p]Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
[p]Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
[p]And leave you hindmost;
[p]Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
[p]Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
[p]O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
[p]Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
[p]For time is like a fashionable host
[p]That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
[p]And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
[p]Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
[p]And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
[p]virtue seek
[p]Remuneration for the thing it was;
[p]For beauty, wit,
[p]High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
[p]Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
[p]To envious and calumniating time.
[p]One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
[p]That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
[p]Though they are made and moulded of things past,
[p]And give to dust that is a little gilt
[p]More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
[p]The present eye praises the present object.
[p]Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
[p]That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
[p]Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
[p]Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
[p]And still it might, and yet it may again,
[p]If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
[p]And case thy reputation in thy tent;
[p]Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
[p]Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
[p]And drave great Mars to faction.
"
"Of this my privacy
[p]I have strong reasons.
"
"But 'gainst your privacy
[p]The reasons are more potent and heroical:
[p]'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
[p]With one of Priam's daughters.
"
"Ha! known!
"
"Is that a wonder?
[p]The providence that's in a watchful state
[p]Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
[p]Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
[p]Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
[p]Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
[p]There is a mystery--with whom relation
[p]Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
[p]Which hath an operation more divine
[p]Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
[p]All the commerce that you have had with Troy
[p]As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
[p]And better would it fit Achilles much
[p]To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
[p]But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
[p]When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
[p]And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
[p]'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
[p]But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
[p]Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
[p]The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
"
"To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:
[p]A woman impudent and mannish grown
[p]Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
[p]In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
[p]They think my little stomach to the war
[p]And your great love to me restrains you thus:
[p]Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
[p]Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
[p]And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
[p]Be shook to air.
"
"Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
"
"Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
"
"I see my reputation is at stake
[p]My fame is shrewdly gored.
"
"O, then, beware;
[p]Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
[p]Omission to do what is necessary
[p]Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
[p]And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
[p]Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
"
"Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
[p]I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
[p]To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
[p]To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
[p]An appetite that I am sick withal,
[p]To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
[p]To talk with him and to behold his visage,
[p]Even to my full of view.
[p][Enter THERSITES]
[p]A labour saved!
"
"A wonder!
"
"What?
"
"Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.
"
"How so?
"
"He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
[p]prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
[p]raves in saying nothing.
"
"How can that be?
"
"Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
[p]and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
[p]arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
[p]bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
[p]say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'
[p]and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
[p]in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
[p]The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his
[p]neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in
[p]vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,
[p]Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think
[p]you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
[p]grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
[p]A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
[p]sides, like a leather jerkin.
"
"Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
"
"Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
[p]answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his
[p]tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
[p]Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the
[p]pageant of Ajax.
"
"To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the
[p]valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
[p]to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
[p]safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
[p]and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
[p]captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
[p]et cetera. Do this.
"
"Jove bless great Ajax!
"
"Hum!
"
"I come from the worthy Achilles,--
"
"Ha!
"
"Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--
"
"Hum!
"
"And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
"
"Agamemnon!
"
"Ay, my lord.
"
"Ha!
"
"What say you to't?
"
"God b' wi' you, with all my heart.
"
"Your answer, sir.
"
"If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will
[p]go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me
[p]ere he has me.
"
"Your answer, sir.
"
"Fare you well, with all my heart.
"
"Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
"
"No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in
[p]him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know
[p]not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo
[p]get his sinews to make catlings on.
"
"Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
"
"Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more
[p]capable creature.
"
"My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
[p]And I myself see not the bottom of it.
"
"Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,
[p]that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
[p]tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.
"
"See, ho! who is that there?
"
"It is the Lord AEneas.
"
"Is the prince there in person?
[p]Had I so good occasion to lie long
[p]As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
[p]Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
"
"That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.
"
"A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--
[p]Witness the process of your speech, wherein
[p]You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
[p]Did haunt you in the field.
"
"Health to you, valiant sir,
[p]During all question of the gentle truce;
[p]But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
[p]As heart can think or courage execute.
"
"The one and other Diomed embraces.
[p]Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!
[p]But when contention and occasion meet,
[p]By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
[p]With all my force, pursuit and policy.
"
"And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
[p]With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
[p]Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
[p]Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
[p]No man alive can love in such a sort
[p]The thing he means to kill more excellently.
"
"We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,
[p]If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
[p]A thousand complete courses of the sun!
[p]But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,
[p]With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
"
"We know each other well.
"
"We do; and long to know each other worse.
"
"This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
[p]The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
[p]What business, lord, so early?
"
"I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.
"
"His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
[p]To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
[p]For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:
[p]Let's have your company, or, if you please,
[p]Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
[p]Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--
[p]My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
[p]Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
[p]With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
[p]We shall be much unwelcome.
"
"That I assure you:
[p]Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
[p]Than Cressid borne from Troy.
"
"There is no help;
[p]The bitter disposition of the time
[p]Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.
"
"Good morrow, all.
"
"And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,
[p]Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
[p]Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,
[p]Myself or Menelaus?
"
"Both alike:
[p]He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,
[p]Not making any scruple of her soilure,
[p]With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
[p]And you as well to keep her, that defend her,
[p]Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
[p]With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
[p]He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
[p]The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
[p]You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
[p]Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
[p]Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;
[p]But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
"
"You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
"
"She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:
[p]For every false drop in her bawdy veins
[p]A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
[p]Of her contaminated carrion weight,
[p]A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,
[p]She hath not given so many good words breath
[p]As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
"
"Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
[p]Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
[p]But we in silence hold this virtue well,
[p]We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
[p]Here lies our way.
"
"Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
"
"Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
[p]He shall unbolt the gates.
"
"Trouble him not;
[p]To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,
[p]And give as soft attachment to thy senses
[p]As infants' empty of all thought!
"
"Good morrow, then.
"
"I prithee now, to bed.
"
"Are you a-weary of me?
"
"O Cressida! but that the busy day,
[p]Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
[p]And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
[p]I would not from thee.
"
"Night hath been too brief.
"
"Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
[p]As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
[p]With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
[p]You will catch cold, and curse me.
"
"Prithee, tarry:
[p]You men will never tarry.
[p]O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
[p]And then you would have tarried. Hark!
[p]there's one up.
"
"[Within] What, 's all the doors open here?
"
"It is your uncle.
"
"A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
[p]I shall have such a life!
"
"How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you
[p]maid! where's my cousin Cressid?
"
"Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
[p]You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
"
"To do what? to do what? let her say
[p]what: what have I brought you to do?
"
"Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
[p]Nor suffer others.
"
"Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!
[p]hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty
[p]man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!
"
"Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
[p][Knocking within]
[p]Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.
[p]My lord, come you again into my chamber:
[p]You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
"
"Ha, ha!
"
"Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
[p][Knocking within]
[p]How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:
[p]I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
"
"Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
[p]down the door? How now! what's the matter?
"
"Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
"
"Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
[p]I knew you not: what news with you so early?
"
"Is not Prince Troilus here?
"
"Here! what should he do here?
"
"Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
[p]It doth import him much to speak with me.
"
"Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll
[p]be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What
[p]should he do here?
"
"Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong
[p]ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be
[p]false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go
[p]fetch him hither; go.
"
"How now! what's the matter?
"
"My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
[p]My matter is so rash: there is at hand
[p]Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
[p]The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
[p]Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
[p]Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
[p]We must give up to Diomedes' hand
[p]The Lady Cressida.
"
"Is it so concluded?
"
"By Priam and the general state of Troy:
[p]They are at hand and ready to effect it.
"
"How my achievements mock me!
[p]I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,
[p]We met by chance; you did not find me here.
"
"Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature
[p]Have not more gift in taciturnity.
"
"Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil
[p]take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a
[p]plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!
"
"How now! what's the matter? who was here?
"
"Ah, ah!
"
"Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
[p]Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
"
"Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
"
"O the gods! what's the matter?
"
"Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
[p]born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor
[p]gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
"
"Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,
[p]what's the matter?
"
"Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou
[p]art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,
[p]and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;
[p]'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.
"
"O you immortal gods! I will not go.
"
"Thou must.
"
"I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;
[p]I know no touch of consanguinity;
[p]No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me
[p]As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
[p]Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
[p]If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
[p]Do to this body what extremes you can;
[p]But the strong base and building of my love
[p]Is as the very centre of the earth,
[p]Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--
"
"Do, do.
"
"Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,
[p]Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
[p]With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.
"
"It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
[p]Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
[p]Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
[p]Tell you the lady what she is to do,
[p]And haste her to the purpose.
"
"Walk into her house;
[p]I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
[p]And to his hand when I deliver her,
[p]Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
[p]A priest there offering to it his own heart.
"
"I know what 'tis to love;
[p]And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
[p]Please you walk in, my lords.
"
"Be moderate, be moderate.
"
"Why tell you me of moderation?
[p]The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
[p]And violenteth in a sense as strong
[p]As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
[p]If I could temporize with my affection,
[p]Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
[p]The like allayment could I give my grief.
[p]My love admits no qualifying dross;
[p]No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
"
"Here, here, here he comes.
[p][Enter TROILUS]
[p]Ah, sweet ducks!
"
"O Troilus! Troilus!
"
"What a pair of spectacles is here!
[p]Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,
[p]'--O heart, heavy heart,
[p]Why sigh'st thou without breaking?
[p]where he answers again,
[p]'Because thou canst not ease thy smart
[p]By friendship nor by speaking.'
[p]There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
[p]nothing, for we may live to have need of such a
[p]verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?
"
"Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,
[p]That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,
[p]More bright in zeal than the devotion which
[p]Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.
"
"Have the gods envy?
"
"Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.
"
"And is it true that I must go from Troy?
"
"A hateful truth.
"
"What, and from Troilus too?
"
"From Troy and Troilus.
"
"Is it possible?
"
"And suddenly; where injury of chance
[p]Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
[p]All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
[p]Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
[p]Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
[p]Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
[p]We two, that with so many thousand sighs
[p]Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
[p]With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
[p]Injurious time now with a robber's haste
[p]Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:
[p]As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
[p]With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
[p]He fumbles up into a lose adieu,
[p]And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
[p]Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
"
"[Within] My lord, is the lady ready?
"
"Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
[p]Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
[p]Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.
"
"Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or
[p]my heart will be blown up by the root.
"
"I must then to the Grecians?
"
"No remedy.
"
"A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
[p]When shall we see again?
"
"Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--
"
"I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?
"
"Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
[p]For it is parting from us:
[p]I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,
[p]For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
[p]That there's no maculation in thy heart:
[p]But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in
[p]My sequent protestation; be thou true,
[p]And I will see thee.
"
"O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers
[p]As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.
"
"And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
"
"And you this glove. When shall I see you?
"
"I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,
[p]To give thee nightly visitation.
[p]But yet be true.
"
"O heavens! 'be true' again!
"
"Hear while I speak it, love:
[p]The Grecian youths are full of quality;
[p]They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,
[p]Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:
[p]How novelty may move, and parts with person,
[p]Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--
[p]Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--
[p]Makes me afeard.
"
"O heavens! you love me not.
"
"Die I a villain, then!
[p]In this I do not call your faith in question
[p]So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,
[p]Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
[p]Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
[p]To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
[p]But I can tell that in each grace of these
[p]There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
[p]That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
"
"Do you think I will?
"
"No.
[p]But something may be done that we will not:
[p]And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
[p]When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
[p]Presuming on their changeful potency.
"
"[Within] Nay, good my lord,--
"
"Come, kiss; and let us part.
"
"[Within] Brother Troilus!
"
"Good brother, come you hither;
[p]And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.
"
"My lord, will you be true?
"
"Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:
[p]Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
[p]I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
[p]Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
[p]With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
[p]Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
[p]Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.
[p][Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS,]
[p]and DIOMEDES]
[p]Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady
[p]Which for Antenor we deliver you:
[p]At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,
[p]And by the way possess thee what she is.
[p]Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
[p]If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
[p]Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
[p]As Priam is in Ilion.
"
"Fair Lady Cressid,
[p]So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
[p]The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
[p]Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed
[p]You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.
"
"Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,
[p]To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
[p]In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,
[p]She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
[p]As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
[p]I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;
[p]For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
[p]Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
[p]I'll cut thy throat.
"
"O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:
[p]Let me be privileged by my place and message,
[p]To be a speaker free; when I am hence
[p]I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,
[p]I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
[p]She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'
[p]I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'
"
"Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,
[p]This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
[p]Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
[p]To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
"
"Hark! Hector's trumpet.
"
"How have we spent this morning!
[p]The prince must think me tardy and remiss,
[p]That sore to ride before him to the field.
"
"'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.
"
"Let us make ready straight.
"
"Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,
[p]Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
[p]The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
[p]On his fair worth and single chivalry.
"
"Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
[p]Anticipating time with starting courage.
[p]Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
[p]Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air
[p]May pierce the head of the great combatant
[p]And hale him hither.
"
"Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
[p]Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
[p]Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
[p]Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:
[p]Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;
[p]Thou blow'st for Hector.
"
"No trumpet answers.
"
"'Tis but early days.
"
"Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
"
"'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;
[p]He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
[p]In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
"
"Is this the Lady Cressid?
"
"Even she.
"
"Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
"
"Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
"
"Yet is the kindness but particular;
[p]'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
"
"And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
[p]So much for Nestor.
"
"I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:
[p]Achilles bids you welcome.
"
"I had good argument for kissing once.
"
"But that's no argument for kissing now;
[p]For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
[p]And parted thus you and your argument.
"
"O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
[p]For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
"
"The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:
[p]Patroclus kisses you.
"
"O, this is trim!
"
"Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
"
"I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.
"
"In kissing, do you render or receive?
"
"Both take and give.
"
"I'll make my match to live,
[p]The kiss you take is better than you give;
[p]Therefore no kiss.
"
"I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.
"
"You're an odd man; give even or give none.
"
"An odd man, lady! every man is odd.
"
"No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,
[p]That you are odd, and he is even with you.
"
"You fillip me o' the head.
"
"No, I'll be sworn.
"
"It were no match, your nail against his horn.
[p]May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
"
"You may.
"
"I do desire it.
"
"Why, beg, then.
"
"Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,
[p]When Helen is a maid again, and his.
"
"I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.
"
"Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
"
"Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.
"
"A woman of quick sense.
"
"Fie, fie upon her!
[p]There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
[p]Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
[p]At every joint and motive of her body.
[p]O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
[p]That give accosting welcome ere it comes,
[p]And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
[p]To every ticklish reader! set them down
[p]For sluttish spoils of opportunity
[p]And daughters of the game.
"
"The Trojans' trumpet.
"
"Yonder comes the troop.
[p][Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS, and other]
[p]Trojans, with Attendants]
"
"Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
[p]To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
[p]A victor shall be known? will you the knights
[p]Shall to the edge of all extremity
[p]Pursue each other, or shall be divided
[p]By any voice or order of the field?
[p]Hector bade ask.
"
"Which way would Hector have it?
"
"He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
"
"'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,
[p]A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
[p]The knight opposed.
"
"If not Achilles, sir,
[p]What is your name?
"
"If not Achilles, nothing.
"
"Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:
[p]In the extremity of great and little,
[p]Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;
[p]The one almost as infinite as all,
[p]The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
[p]And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
[p]This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
[p]In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
[p]Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
[p]This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
"
"A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.
"
"Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
[p]Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
[p]Consent upon the order of their fight,
[p]So be it; either to the uttermost,
[p]Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
[p]Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
"
"They are opposed already.
"
"What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
"
"The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
[p]Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
[p]Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
[p]Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
[p]His heart and hand both open and both free;
[p]For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
[p]Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
[p]Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
[p]Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
[p]For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
[p]To tender objects, but he in heat of action
[p]Is more vindicative than jealous love:
[p]They call him Troilus, and on him erect
[p]A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
[p]Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
[p]Even to his inches, and with private soul
[p]Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
"
"They are in action.
"
"Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
"
"Hector, thou sleep'st;
[p]Awake thee!
"
"His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!
"
"You must no more.
"
"Princes, enough, so please you.
"
"I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
"
"As Hector pleases.
"
"Why, then will I no more:
[p]Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
[p]A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
[p]The obligation of our blood forbids
[p]A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
[p]Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
[p]That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,
[p]And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
[p]All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
[p]Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
[p]Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,
[p]Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
[p]Wherein my sword had not impressure made
[p]Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
[p]That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
[p]My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
[p]Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:
[p]By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
[p]Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
[p]Cousin, all honour to thee!
"
"I thank thee, Hector
[p]Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
[p]I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
[p]A great addition earned in thy death.
"
"Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
[p]On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
[p]Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
[p]A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
"
"There is expectance here from both the sides,
[p]What further you will do.
"
"We'll answer it;
[p]The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.
"
"If I might in entreaties find success--
[p]As seld I have the chance--I would desire
[p]My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
"
"'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
[p]Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
"
"AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
[p]And signify this loving interview
[p]To the expecters of our Trojan part;
[p]Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
[p]I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
"
"Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
"
"The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
[p]But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
[p]Shall find him by his large and portly size.
"
"Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
[p]That would be rid of such an enemy;
[p]But that's no welcome: understand more clear,
[p]What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
[p]And formless ruin of oblivion;
[p]But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
[p]Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
[p]Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
[p]From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.
"
"I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
"
"[To TROILUS] My well-famed lord of Troy, no
[p]less to you.
"
"Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
[p]You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
"
"Who must we answer?
"
"The noble Menelaus.
"
"O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
[p]Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;
[p]Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
[p]She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
"
"Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
"
"O, pardon; I offend.
"
"I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
[p]Labouring for destiny make cruel way
[p]Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
[p]As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
[p]Despising many forfeits and subduements,
[p]When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
[p]Not letting it decline on the declined,
[p]That I have said to some my standers by
[p]'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
[p]And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
[p]When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
[p]Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;
[p]But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
[p]I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
[p]And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
[p]But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
[p]Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;
[p]And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
"
"'Tis the old Nestor.
"
"Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
[p]That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
[p]Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
"
"I would my arms could match thee in contention,
[p]As they contend with thee in courtesy.
"
"I would they could.
"
"Ha!
[p]By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.
[p]Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.
"
"I wonder now how yonder city stands
[p]When we have here her base and pillar by us.
"
"I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
[p]Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
[p]Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
[p]In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.
"
"Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:
[p]My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
[p]For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
[p]Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
[p]Must kiss their own feet.
"
"I must not believe you:
[p]There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
[p]The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
[p]A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
[p]And that old common arbitrator, Time,
[p]Will one day end it.
"
"So to him we leave it.
[p]Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:
[p]After the general, I beseech you next
[p]To feast with me and see me at my tent.
"
"I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
[p]Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
[p]I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
[p]And quoted joint by joint.
"
"Is this Achilles?
"
"I am Achilles.
"
"Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.
"
"Behold thy fill.
"
"Nay, I have done already.
"
"Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
[p]As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.
"
"O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
[p]But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
[p]Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
"
"Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
[p]Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
[p]That I may give the local wound a name
[p]And make distinct the very breach whereout
[p]Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!
"
"It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
[p]To answer such a question: stand again:
[p]Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
[p]As to prenominate in nice conjecture
[p]Where thou wilt hit me dead?
"
"I tell thee, yea.
"
"Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
[p]I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;
[p]For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
[p]But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
[p]I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
[p]You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
[p]His insolence draws folly from my lips;
[p]But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
[p]Or may I never--
"
"Do not chafe thee, cousin:
[p]And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
[p]Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
[p]You may have every day enough of Hector
[p]If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,
[p]Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
"
"I pray you, let us see you in the field:
[p]We have had pelting wars, since you refused
[p]The Grecians' cause.
"
"Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
[p]To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
[p]To-night all friends.
"
"Thy hand upon that match.
"
"First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
[p]There in the full convive we: afterwards,
[p]As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
[p]Concur together, severally entreat him.
[p]Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
[p]That this great soldier may his welcome know.
"
"My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
[p]In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?
"
"At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:
[p]There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;
[p]Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
[p]But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
[p]On the fair Cressid.
"
"Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
[p]After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
[p]To bring me thither?
"
"You shall command me, sir.
[p]As gentle tell me, of what honour was
[p]This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
[p]That wails her absence?
"
"O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars
[p]A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
[p]She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:
[p]But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.
"
"I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,
[p]Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.
[p]Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.
"
"Here comes Thersites.
"
"How now, thou core of envy!
[p]Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?
"
"Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol
[p]of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.
"
"From whence, fragment?
"
"Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.
"
"Who keeps the tent now?
"
"The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.
"
"Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?
"
"Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:
[p]thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.
"
"Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?
"
"Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases
[p]of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,
[p]loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold
[p]palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing
[p]lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,
[p]limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the
[p]rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take
[p]again such preposterous discoveries!
"
"Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest
[p]thou to curse thus?
"
"Do I curse thee?
"
"Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson
[p]indistinguishable cur, no.
"
"No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle
[p]immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet
[p]flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's
[p]purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered
[p]with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!
"
"Out, gall!
"
"Finch-egg!
"
"My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
[p]From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
[p]Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
[p]A token from her daughter, my fair love,
[p]Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
[p]An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:
[p]Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
[p]My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
[p]Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:
[p]This night in banqueting must all be spent.
[p]Away, Patroclus!
"
"With too much blood and too little brain, these two
[p]may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too
[p]little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.
[p]Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one
[p]that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as
[p]earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter
[p]there, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,
[p]and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty
[p]shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's
[p]leg,--to what form but that he is, should wit larded
[p]with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
[p]To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to
[p]an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a
[p]dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an
[p]owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would
[p]not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire
[p]against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I
[p]were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse
[p]of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!
[p]spirits and fires!
[p][Enter HECTOR, TROILUS, AJAX, AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES,]
[p]NESTOR, MENELAUS, and DIOMEDES, with lights]
"
"We go wrong, we go wrong.
"
"No, yonder 'tis;
[p]There, where we see the lights.
"
"I trouble you.
"
"No, not a whit.
"
"Here comes himself to guide you.
"
"Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.
"
"So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.
[p]Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
"
"Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.
"
"Good night, my lord.
"
"Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.
"
"Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,
[p]sweet sewer.
"
"Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
[p]That go or tarry.
"
"Good night.
"
"Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,
[p]Keep Hector company an hour or two.
"
"I cannot, lord; I have important business,
[p]The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.
"
"Give me your hand.
"
"[Aside to TROILUS] Follow his torch; he goes to
[p]Calchas' tent:
[p]I'll keep you company.
"
"Sweet sir, you honour me.
"
"And so, good night.
"
"Come, come, enter my tent.
"
"That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most
[p]unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers
[p]than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
[p]his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:
[p]but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it
[p]is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun
[p]borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
[p]word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than
[p]not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
[p]drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll
[p]after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!
"
"What, are you up here, ho? speak.
"
"[Within] Who calls?
"
"Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?
"
"[Within] She comes to you.
[p][Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES, at a distance;]
[p]after them, THERSITES]
"
"Stand where the torch may not discover us.
"
"Cressid comes forth to him.
"
"How now, my charge!
"
"Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.
"
"Yea, so familiar!
"
"She will sing any man at first sight.
"
"And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;
[p]she's noted.
"
"Will you remember?
"
"Remember! yes.
"
"Nay, but do, then;
[p]And let your mind be coupled with your words.
"
"What should she remember?
"
"List.
"
"Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
"
"Roguery!
"
"Nay, then,--
"
"I'll tell you what,--
"
"Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.
"
"In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?
"
"A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.
"
"What did you swear you would bestow on me?
"
"I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
[p]Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.
"
"Good night.
"
"Hold, patience!
"
"How now, Trojan!
"
"Diomed,--
"
"No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.
"
"Thy better must.
"
"Hark, one word in your ear.
"
"O plague and madness!
"
"You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,
[p]Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
[p]To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;
[p]The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.
"
"Behold, I pray you!
"
"Nay, good my lord, go off:
[p]You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.
"
"I pray thee, stay.
"
"You have not patience; come.
"
"I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments
[p]I will not speak a word!
"
"And so, good night.
"
"Nay, but you part in anger.
"
"Doth that grieve thee?
[p]O wither'd truth!
"
"Why, how now, lord!
"
"By Jove,
[p]I will be patient.
"
"Guardian!--why, Greek!
"
"Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.
"
"In faith, I do not: come hither once again.
"
"You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?
[p]You will break out.
"
"She strokes his cheek!
"
"Come, come.
"
"Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
[p]There is between my will and all offences
[p]A guard of patience: stay a little while.
"
"How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and
[p]potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!
"
"But will you, then?
"
"In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.
"
"Give me some token for the surety of it.
"
"I'll fetch you one.
"
"You have sworn patience.
"
"Fear me not, sweet lord;
[p]I will not be myself, nor have cognition
[p]Of what I feel: I am all patience.
"
"Now the pledge; now, now, now!
"
"Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.
"
"O beauty! where is thy faith?
"
"My lord,--
"
"I will be patient; outwardly I will.
"
"You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.
[p]He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.
"
"Whose was't?
"
"It is no matter, now I have't again.
[p]I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
[p]I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.
"
"Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!
"
"I shall have it.
"
"What, this?
"
"Ay, that.
"
"O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
[p]Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
[p]Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
[p]And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
[p]As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;
[p]He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
"
"I had your heart before, this follows it.
"
"I did swear patience.
"
"You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;
[p]I'll give you something else.
"
"I will have this: whose was it?
"
"It is no matter.
"
"Come, tell me whose it was.
"
"'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
[p]But, now you have it, take it.
"
"Whose was it?
"
"By all Diana's waiting-women yond,
[p]And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
"
"To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
[p]And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
"
"Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,
[p]It should be challenged.
"
"Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;
[p]I will not keep my word.
"
"Why, then, farewell;
[p]Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
"
"You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
[p]But it straight starts you.
"
"I do not like this fooling.
"
"Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.
"
"What, shall I come? the hour?
"
"Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.
"
"Farewell till then.
"
"Good night: I prithee, come.
[p][Exit DIOMEDES]
[p]Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee
[p]But with my heart the other eye doth see.
[p]Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
[p]The error of our eye directs our mind:
[p]What error leads must err; O, then conclude
[p]Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.
"
"A proof of strength she could not publish more,
[p]Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'
"
"All's done, my lord.
"
"It is.
"
"Why stay we, then?
"
"To make a recordation to my soul
[p]Of every syllable that here was spoke.
[p]But if I tell how these two did co-act,
[p]Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
[p]Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
[p]An esperance so obstinately strong,
[p]That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,
[p]As if those organs had deceptious functions,
[p]Created only to calumniate.
[p]Was Cressid here?
"
"I cannot conjure, Trojan.
"
"She was not, sure.
"
"Most sure she was.
"
"Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.
"
"Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
"
"Let it not be believed for womanhood!
[p]Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage
[p]To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,
[p]For depravation, to square the general sex
[p]By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.
"
"What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?
"
"Nothing at all, unless that this were she.
"
"Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
"
"This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:
[p]If beauty have a soul, this is not she;
[p]If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
[p]If sanctimony be the gods' delight,
[p]If there be rule in unity itself,
[p]This is not she. O madness of discourse,
[p]That cause sets up with and against itself!
[p]Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
[p]Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
[p]Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.
[p]Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
[p]Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
[p]Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
[p]And yet the spacious breadth of this division
[p]Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
[p]As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
[p]Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
[p]Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:
[p]Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;
[p]The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;
[p]And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
[p]The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
[p]The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics
[p]Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.
"
"May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
[p]With that which here his passion doth express?
"
"Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well
[p]In characters as red as Mars his heart
[p]Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
[p]With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
[p]Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
[p]So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
[p]That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;
[p]Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,
[p]My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
[p]Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
[p]Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,
[p]Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
[p]In his descent than shall my prompted sword
[p]Falling on Diomed.
"
"He'll tickle it for his concupy.
"
"O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!
[p]Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
[p]And they'll seem glorious.
"
"O, contain yourself
[p]Your passion draws ears hither.
"
"I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:
[p]Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
[p]Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.
"
"Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.
[p]Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,
[p]Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!
"
"I'll bring you to the gates.
"
"Accept distracted thanks.
"
"Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
[p]croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.
[p]Patroclus will give me any thing for the
[p]intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
[p]do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
[p]Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing
[p]else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!
"
"When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,
[p]To stop his ears against admonishment?
[p]Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.
"
"You train me to offend you; get you in:
[p]By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!
"
"My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.
"
"No more, I say.
"
"Where is my brother Hector?
"
"Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent.
[p]Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
[p]Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd
[p]Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
[p]Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
"
"O, 'tis true.
"
"Ho! bid my trumpet sound!
"
"No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.
"
"Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.
"
"The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
[p]They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd
[p]Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.
"
"O, be persuaded! do not count it holy
[p]To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,
[p]For we would give much, to use violent thefts,
[p]And rob in the behalf of charity.
"
"It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
[p]But vows to every purpose must not hold:
[p]Unarm, sweet Hector.
"
"Hold you still, I say;
[p]Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:
[p]Lie every man holds dear; but the brave man
[p]Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.
[p][Enter TROILUS]
[p]How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?
"
"Cassandra, call my father to persuade.
"
"No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
[p]I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
[p]Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
[p]And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
[p]Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
[p]I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.
"
"Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
[p]Which better fits a lion than a man.
"
"What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.
"
"When many times the captive Grecian falls,
[p]Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
[p]You bid them rise, and live.
"
"O,'tis fair play.
"
"Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.
"
"How now! how now!
"
"For the love of all the gods,
[p]Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,
[p]And when we have our armours buckled on,
[p]The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,
[p]Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.
"
"Fie, savage, fie!
"
"Hector, then 'tis wars.
"
"Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.
"
"Who should withhold me?
[p]Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
[p]Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;
[p]Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
[p]Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;
[p]Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
[p]Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,
[p]But by my ruin.
"
"Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
[p]He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,
[p]Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
[p]Fall all together.
"
"Come, Hector, come, go back:
[p]Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;
[p]Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself
[p]Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
[p]To tell thee that this day is ominous:
[p]Therefore, come back.
"
"AEneas is a-field;
[p]And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
[p]Even in the faith of valour, to appear
[p]This morning to them.
"
"Ay, but thou shalt not go.
"
"I must not break my faith.
[p]You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
[p]Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
[p]To take that course by your consent and voice,
[p]Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.
"
"O Priam, yield not to him!
"
"Do not, dear father.
"
"Andromache, I am offended with you:
[p]Upon the love you bear me, get you in.
"
"This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
[p]Makes all these bodements.
"
"O, farewell, dear Hector!
[p]Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!
[p]Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
[p]Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!
[p]How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
[p]Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,
[p]Like witless antics, one another meet,
[p]And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!
"
"Away! away!
"
"Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave:
[p]Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.
"
"You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
[p]Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
[p]Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.
"
"Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!
"
"They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
[p]I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.
"
"Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?
"
"What now?
"
"Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.
"
"Let me read.
"
"A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so
[p]troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl;
[p]and what one thing, what another, that I shall
[p]leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum
[p]in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones
[p]that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what
[p]to think on't. What says she there?
"
"Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart:
[p]The effect doth operate another way.
[p][Tearing the letter]
[p]Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.
[p]My love with words and errors still she feeds;
[p]But edifies another with her deeds.
"
"Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go
[p]look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,
[p]has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's
[p]sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see
[p]them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that
[p]loves the whore there, might send that Greekish
[p]whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the
[p]dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.
[p]O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty
[p]swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry
[p]cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is
[p]not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in
[p]policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of
[p]as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax
[p]prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm
[p]to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim
[p]barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.
[p]Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.
"
"Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,
[p]I would swim after.
"
"Thou dost miscall retire:
[p]I do not fly, but advantageous care
[p]Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:
[p]Have at thee!
"
"Hold thy whore, Grecian!--now for thy whore,
[p]Trojan!--now the sleeve, now the sleeve!
"
"What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?
[p]Art thou of blood and honour?
"
"No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:
[p]a very filthy rogue.
"
"I do believe thee: live.
"
"God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a
[p]plague break thy neck for frightening me! What's
[p]become of the wenching rogues? I think they have
[p]swallowed one another: I would laugh at that
[p]miracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.
[p]I'll seek them.
"
"Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
[p]Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:
[p]Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;
[p]Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,
[p]And am her knight by proof.
"
"I go, my lord.
"
"Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas
[p]Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
[p]Hath Doreus prisoner,
[p]And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
[p]Upon the pashed corses of the kings
[p]Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,
[p]Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
[p]Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes
[p]Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary
[p]Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,
[p]To reinforcement, or we perish all.
"
"Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles;
[p]And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
[p]There is a thousand Hectors in the field:
[p]Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,
[p]And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
[p]And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
[p]Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
[p]And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
[p]Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:
[p]Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,
[p]Dexterity so obeying appetite
[p]That what he will he does, and does so much
[p]That proof is call'd impossibility.
"
"O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles
[p]Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance:
[p]Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,
[p]Together with his mangled Myrmidons,
[p]That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,
[p]Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend
[p]And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
[p]Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
[p]Mad and fantastic execution,
[p]Engaging and redeeming of himself
[p]With such a careless force and forceless care
[p]As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,
[p]Bade him win all.
"
"Troilus! thou coward Troilus!
"
"Ay, there, there.
"
"So, so, we draw together.
"
"Where is this Hector?
[p]Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face;
[p]Know what it is to meet Achilles angry:
[p]Hector? where's Hector? I will none but Hector.
"
"Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!
"
"Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?
"
"What wouldst thou?
"
"I would correct him.
"
"Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
[p]Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!
"
"O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,
[p]And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!
"
"Ha, art thou there?
"
"I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.
"
"He is my prize; I will not look upon.
"
"Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!
"
"Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!
"
"Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!
"
"Pause, if thou wilt.
"
"I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:
[p]Be happy that my arms are out of use:
[p]My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
[p]But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
[p]Till when, go seek thy fortune.
"
"Fare thee well:
[p]I would have been much more a fresher man,
[p]Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!
"
"Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?
[p]No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
[p]He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too,
[p]Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
[p]I reck not though I end my life to-day.
"
"Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
[p]No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well;
[p]I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
[p]But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not,
[p]beast, abide?
[p]Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
"
"Come here about me, you my Myrmidons;
[p]Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
[p]Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:
[p]And when I have the bloody Hector found,
[p]Empale him with your weapons round about;
[p]In fellest manner execute your aims.
[p]Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:
[p]It is decreed Hector the great must die.
[p][Exeunt]
[p][Enter MENELAUS and PARIS, fighting:]
[p]then THERSITES]
"
"The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now,
[p]bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double-
[p]henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the
[p]game: ware horns, ho!
"
"Turn, slave, and fight.
"
"What art thou?
"
"A bastard son of Priam's.
"
"I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard
[p]begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard
[p]in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will
[p]not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?
[p]Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the
[p]son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment:
[p]farewell, bastard.
"
"The devil take thee, coward!
"
"Most putrefied core, so fair without,
[p]Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
[p]Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
[p]Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
[p][Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield]
[p]behind him]
"
"Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;
[p]How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
[p]Even with the vail and darking of the sun,
[p]To close the day up, Hector's life is done.
"
"I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.
"
"Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
[p][HECTOR falls]
[p]So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!
[p]Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
[p]On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
[p]'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'
[p][A retreat sounded]
[p]Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.
"
"The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.
"
"The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,
[p]And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
[p]My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,
[p]Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
[p][Sheathes his sword]
[p]Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;
[p]Along the field I will the Trojan trail.
"
"Hark! hark! what shout is that?
"
"Peace, drums!
[p][Within]
[p]Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.
"
"The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
"
"If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
[p]Great Hector was a man as good as he.
"
"March patiently along: let one be sent
[p]To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
[p]If in his death the gods have us befriended,
[p]Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
"
"Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:
[p]Never go home; here starve we out the night.
"
"Hector is slain.
"
"Hector! the gods forbid!
"
"He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,
[p]In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
[p]Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
[p]Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
[p]I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
[p]And linger not our sure destructions on!
"
"My lord, you do discomfort all the host!
"
"You understand me not that tell me so:
[p]I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
[p]But dare all imminence that gods and men
[p]Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
[p]Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
[p]Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,
[p]Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:
[p]There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
[p]Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
[p]Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
[p]Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:
[p]Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
[p]Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
[p]Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
[p]Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
[p]I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,
[p]No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
[p]I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
[p]That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
[p]Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
[p]Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
[p][Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans]
[p][As TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other]
[p]side, PANDARUS]
"
"But hear you, hear you!
"
"Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame
[p]Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!
"
"A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!
[p]world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!
[p]O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set
[p]a-work, and how ill requited! why should our
[p]endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
[p]what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:
[p]Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,
[p]Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;
[p]And being once subdued in armed tail,
[p]Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
[p]Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
[p]painted cloths.
[p]As many as be here of pander's hall,
[p]Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;
[p]Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
[p]Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
[p]Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
[p]Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
[p]It should be now, but that my fear is this,
[p]Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:
[p]Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,
[p]And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.
"
